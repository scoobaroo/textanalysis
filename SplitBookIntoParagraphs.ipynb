      "['it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious strangerwhom i am going to talk about.  he attracted me by three things:his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor,and the restfulness of his company--for he did all the talking.we fell together, as modest people will, in the tail of the herdthat was being shown through, and he at once began to say thingswhich interested me.  as he talked along, softly, pleasantly,flowingly, he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this worldand time, and into some remote era and old forgotten country;and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that i seemedto move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold of a grayantiquity, holding speech with a relic of it!  exactly as i wouldspeak of my nearest personal friends or enemies, or my most familiarneighbors, he spoke of sir bedivere, sir bors de ganis, sir launcelotof the lake, sir galahad, and all the other great names of thetable round--and how old, old, unspeakably old and faded and dryand musty and ancient he came to look as he went on!  presentlyhe turned to me and said, just as one might speak of the weather,or any other common matter--', '“you know about transmigration of souls; do you know abouttransposition of epochs--and bodies?”', 'i said i had not heard of it.  he was so little interested--justas when people speak of the weather--that he did not noticewhether i made him any answer or not. there was half a momentof silence, immediately interrupted by the droning voice of thesalaried cicerone:', '“ancient hauberk, date of the sixth century, time of king arthurand the round table; said to have belonged to the knight sir sagramorle desirous; observe the round hole through the chain-mail inthe left breast; can’t be accounted for; supposed to have beendone with a bullet since invention of firearms--perhaps maliciouslyby cromwell’s soldiers.”', 'my acquaintance smiled--not a modern smile, but one that musthave gone out of general use many, many centuries ago--and mutteredapparently to himself:', '“wit ye well, _i saw it done_.”  then, after a pause, added:“i did it myself.”', 'by the time i had recovered from the electric surprise of thisremark, he was gone.', 'all that evening i sat by my fire at the warwick arms, steepedin a dream of the olden time, while the rain beat upon the windows,and the wind roared about the eaves and corners.  from time totime i dipped into old sir thomas malory’s enchanting book, andfed at its rich feast of prodigies and adventures, breathed inthe fragrance of its obsolete names, and dreamed again.  midnightbeing come at length, i read another tale, for a nightcap--thiswhich here follows, to wit:', 'how sir launcelot slew two giants, and made a castle free', '   anon withal came there upon him two great giants,   well armed, all save the heads, with two horrible   clubs in their hands.  sir launcelot put his shield   afore him, and put the stroke away of the one   giant, and with his sword he clave his head asunder.   when his fellow saw that, he ran away as he were   wood [*demented], for fear of the horrible strokes,   and sir launcelot after him with all his might,   and smote him on the shoulder, and clave him to   the middle.  then sir launcelot went into the hall,   and there came afore him three score ladies and   damsels, and all kneeled unto him, and thanked   god and him of their deliverance.  for, sir, said   they, the most part of us have been here this   seven year their prisoners, and we have worked all   manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all   great gentle-women born, and blessed be the time,   knight, that ever thou wert born; for thou hast   done the most worship that ever did knight in the   world, that will we bear record, and we all pray   you to tell us your name, that we may tell our   friends who delivered us out of prison.  fair   damsels, he said, my name is sir launcelot du   lake.  and so he departed from them and betaught   them unto god.  and then he mounted upon his   horse, and rode into many strange and wild   countries, and through many waters and valleys,   and evil was he lodged.  and at the last by   fortune him happened against a night to come to   a fair courtilage, and therein he found an old   gentle-woman that lodged him with a good-will,   and there he had good cheer for him and his horse.   and when time was, his host brought him into a   fair garret over the gate to his bed. there   sir launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness   by him, and went to bed, and anon he fell on   sleep. so, soon after there came one on   horseback, and knocked at the gate in great   haste.  and when sir launcelot heard this he rose   up, and looked out at the window, and saw by the   moonlight three knights come riding after that   one man, and all three lashed on him at once   with swords, and that one knight turned on them   knightly again and defended him. truly, said   sir launcelot, yonder one knight shall i help,   for it were shame for me to see three knights   on one, and if he be slain i am partner of his   death.  and therewith he took his harness and   went out at a window by a sheet down to the four   knights, and then sir launcelot said on high,   turn you knights unto me, and leave your   fighting with that knight. and then they all   three left sir kay, and turned unto sir launcelot,   and there began great battle, for they alight   all three, and strake many strokes at sir   launcelot, and assailed him on every side. then   sir kay dressed him for to have holpen sir   launcelot.  nay, sir, said he, i will none of   your help, therefore as ye will have my help   let me alone with them.  sir kay for the pleasure   of the knight suffered him for to do his will,   and so stood aside. and then anon within six   strokes sir launcelot had stricken them to the earth.', '   and then they all three cried, sir knight, we   yield us unto you as man of might matchless.  as   to that, said sir launcelot, i will not take   your yielding unto me, but so that ye yield   you unto sir kay the seneschal, on that covenant   i will save your lives and else not.  fair knight,   said they, that were we loath to do; for as for   sir kay we chased him hither, and had overcome   him had ye not been; therefore, to yield us unto   him it were no reason.  well, as to that, said   sir launcelot, advise you well, for ye may   choose whether ye will die or live, for an ye be   yielden, it shall be unto sir kay.  fair knight,   then they said, in saving our lives we will do   as thou commandest us.  then shall ye, said sir   launcelot, on whitsunday next coming go unto the   court of king arthur, and there shall ye yield   you unto queen guenever, and put you all three   in her grace and mercy, and say that sir kay   sent you thither to be her prisoners.  on the morn   sir launcelot arose early, and left sir kay   sleeping; and sir launcelot took sir kay’s armor   and his shield and armed him, and so he went to   the stable and took his horse, and took his leave   of his host, and so he departed.  then soon after   arose sir kay and missed sir launcelot; and   then he espied that he had his armor and his   horse. now by my faith i know well that he will   grieve some of the court of king arthur; for on   him knights will be bold, and deem that it is i,   and that will beguile them; and because of his   armor and shield i am sure i shall ride in peace.   and then soon after departed sir kay, and   thanked his host.', 'as i laid the book down there was a knock at the door, and mystranger came in.  i gave him a pipe and a chair, and made himwelcome.  i also comforted him with a hot scotch whisky; gave himanother one; then still another--hoping always for his story.after a fourth persuader, he drifted into it himself, in a quitesimple and natural way:', '', 'the stranger’s history', 'i am an american.  i was born and reared in hartford, in the stateof connecticut--anyway, just over the river, in the country.  soi am a yankee of the yankees--and practical; yes, and nearlybarren of sentiment, i suppose--or poetry, in other words.  myfather was a blacksmith, my uncle was a horse doctor, and i wasboth, along at first.  then i went over to the great arms factoryand learned my real trade; learned all there was to it; learnedto make everything: guns, revolvers, cannon, boilers, engines, allsorts of labor-saving machinery.  why, i could make anythinga body wanted--anything in the world, it didn’t make any differencewhat; and if there wasn’t any quick new-fangled way to make a thing,i could invent one--and do it as easy as rolling off a log.  i becamehead superintendent; had a couple of thousand men under me.', 'well, a man like that is a man that is full of fight--that goeswithout saying.  with a couple of thousand rough men under one,one has plenty of that sort of amusement.  i had, anyway.  at lasti met my match, and i got my dose.  it was during a misunderstandingconducted with crowbars with a fellow we used to call hercules.he laid me out with a crusher alongside the head that made everythingcrack, and seemed to spring every joint in my skull and made itoverlap its neighbor.  then the world went out in darkness, andi didn’t feel anything more, and didn’t know anything at all--at least for a while.', 'when i came to again, i was sitting under an oak tree, on thegrass, with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape allto myself--nearly.  not entirely; for there was a fellow on a horse,looking down at me--a fellow fresh out of a picture-book.  he wasin old-time iron armor from head to heel, with a helmet on hishead the shape of a nail-keg with slits in it; and he had a shield,and a sword, and a prodigious spear; and his horse had armor on,too, and a steel horn projecting from his forehead, and gorgeousred and green silk trappings that hung down all around him likea bedquilt, nearly to the ground.', '“fair sir, will ye just?” said this fellow.', '“will i which?”', '“will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for--”', '“what are you giving me?” i said.  “get along back to your circus,or i’ll report you.”', 'now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yardsand then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear, with hisnail-keg bent down nearly to his horse’s neck and his long spearpointed straight ahead.  i saw he meant business, so i was upthe tree when he arrived.', 'he allowed that i was his property, the captive of his spear.there was argument on his side--and the bulk of the advantage--so i judged it best to humor him.  we fixed up an agreementwhereby i was to go with him and he was not to hurt me.  i camedown, and we started away, i walking by the side of his horse.we marched comfortably along, through glades and over brooks whichi could not remember to have seen before--which puzzled me andmade me wonder--and yet we did not come to any circus or sign ofa circus.  so i gave up the idea of a circus, and concluded he wasfrom an asylum.  but we never came to an asylum--so i was upa stump, as you may say.  i asked him how far we were from hartford.he said he had never heard of the place; which i took to be a lie,but allowed it to go at that.  at the end of an hour we saw afar-away town sleeping in a valley by a winding river; and beyondit on a hill, a vast gray fortress, with towers and turrets,the first i had ever seen out of a picture.', '“bridgeport?” said i, pointing.', '“camelot,” said he.', 'my stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness.  he caughthimself nodding, now, and smiled one of those pathetic, obsoletesmiles of his, and said:', '“i find i can’t go on; but come with me, i’ve got it all writtenout, and you can read it if you like.”', 'in his chamber, he said: “first, i kept a journal; then by and by,after years, i took the journal and turned it into a book. howlong ago that was!”', 'he handed me his manuscript, and pointed out the place wherei should begin:', '“begin here--i’ve already told you what goes before.”  he wassteeped in drowsiness by this time.  as i went out at his doori heard him murmur sleepily: “give you good den, fair sir.”', 'i sat down by my fire and examined my treasure.  the first partof it--the great bulk of it--was parchment, and yellow with age.i scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest.under the old dim writing of the yankee historian appeared tracesof a penmanship which was older and dimmer still--latin wordsand sentences: fragments from old monkish legends, evidently.i turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read--as follows:', '', 'the tale of the lost land', '', 'chapter i', 'camelot', '“camelot--camelot,” said i to myself.  “i don’t seem to rememberhearing of it before.  name of the asylum, likely.”', 'it was a soft, reposeful summer landscape, as lovely as a dream,and as lonesome as sunday.  the air was full of the smell offlowers, and the buzzing of insects, and the twittering of birds,and there were no people, no wagons, there was no stir of life,nothing going on.  the road was mainly a winding path with hoof-printsin it, and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side inthe grass--wheels that apparently had a tire as broad as one’s hand.', 'presently a fair slip of a girl, about ten years old, with a cataractof golden hair streaming down over her shoulders, came along.around her head she wore a hoop of flame-red poppies. it was assweet an outfit as ever i saw, what there was of it.  she walkedindolently along, with a mind at rest, its peace reflected in herinnocent face.  the circus man paid no attention to her; didn’teven seem to see her.  and she--she was no more startled at hisfantastic make-up than if she was used to his like every day ofher life.  she was going by as indifferently as she might have goneby a couple of cows; but when she happened to notice me, _then_there was a change!  up went her hands, and she was turned to stone;her mouth dropped open, her eyes stared wide and timorously, shewas the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear.  andthere she stood gazing, in a sort of stupefied fascination, tillwe turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view.  thatshe should be startled at me instead of at the other man, was toomany for me; i couldn’t make head or tail of it.  and that sheshould seem to consider me a spectacle, and totally overlook herown merits in that respect, was another puzzling thing, and adisplay of magnanimity, too, that was surprising in one so young.there was food for thought here.  i moved along as one in a dream.', 'as we approached the town, signs of life began to appear.  atintervals we passed a wretched cabin, with a thatched roof, andabout it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state ofcultivation.  there were people, too; brawny men, with long, coarse,uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them looklike animals.  they and the women, as a rule, wore a coarsetow-linen robe that came well below the knee, and a rude sort ofsandal, and many wore an iron collar.  the small boys and girlswere always naked; but nobody seemed to know it.  all of thesepeople stared at me, talked about me, ran into the huts and fetchedout their families to gape at me; but nobody ever noticed thatother fellow, except to make him humble salutation and get noresponse for their pains.', 'in the town were some substantial windowless houses of stonescattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins; the streets weremere crooked alleys, and unpaved; troops of dogs and nude childrenplayed in the sun and made life and noise; hogs roamed and rootedcontentedly about, and one of them lay in a reeking wallow inthe middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family.presently there was a distant blare of military music; it camenearer, still nearer, and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view,glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting bannersand rich doublets and horse-cloths and gilded spearheads; andthrough the muck and swine, and naked brats, and joyous dogs, andshabby huts, it took its gallant way, and in its wake we followed.followed through one winding alley and then another,--and climbing,always climbing--till at last we gained the breezy height wherethe huge castle stood.  there was an exchange of bugle blasts;then a parley from the walls, where men-at-arms, in hauberk andmorion, marched back and forth with halberd at shoulder underflapping banners with the rude figure of a dragon displayed uponthem; and then the great gates were flung open, the drawbridgewas lowered, and the head of the cavalcade swept forward underthe frowning arches; and we, following, soon found ourselves ina great paved court, with towers and turrets stretching up intothe blue air on all the four sides; and all about us the dismountwas going on, and much greeting and ceremony, and running to andfro, and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors, andan altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion.', '', 'chapter ii', 'king arthur’s court', 'the moment i got a chance i slipped aside privately and touchedan ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said, in aninsinuating, confidential way:', '“friend, do me a kindness.  do you belong to the asylum, or areyou just on a visit or something like that?”', 'he looked me over stupidly, and said:', '“marry, fair sir, me seemeth--”', '“that will do,” i said; “i reckon you are a patient.”', 'i moved away, cogitating, and at the same time keeping an eyeout for any chance passenger in his right mind that might comealong and give me some light.  i judged i had found one, presently;so i drew him aside and said in his ear:', '“if i could see the head keeper a minute--only just a minute--”', '“prithee do not let me.”', '“let you _what_?”', '“_hinder_ me, then, if the word please thee better.  then he wenton to say he was an under-cook and could not stop to gossip,though he would like it another time; for it would comfort hisvery liver to know where i got my clothes.  as he started away hepointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose,and was seeking me besides, no doubt.  this was an airy slim boyin shrimp-colored tights that made him look like a forked carrot,the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles;and he had long yellow curls, and wore a plumed pink satin captilted complacently over his ear.  by his look, he was good-natured;by his gait, he was satisfied with himself.  he was pretty enoughto frame.  he arrived, looked me over with a smiling and impudentcuriosity; said he had come for me, and informed me that he was a page.', '“go ‘long,” i said; “you ain’t more than a paragraph.”', 'it was pretty severe, but i was nettled.  however, it never phazedhim; he didn’t appear to know he was hurt.  he began to talk andlaugh, in happy, thoughtless, boyish fashion, as we walked along,and made himself old friends with me at once; asked me all sortsof questions about myself and about my clothes, but never waitedfor an answer--always chattered straight ahead, as if he didn’tknow he had asked a question and wasn’t expecting any reply, untilat last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginningof the year 513.', 'it made the cold chills creep over me!  i stopped and said,a little faintly:', '“maybe i didn’t hear you just right.  say it again--and say itslow.  what year was it?”', '“513.”', '“513!  you don’t look it!  come, my boy, i am a stranger andfriendless; be honest and honorable with me.  are you in yourright mind?”', 'he said he was.', '“are these other people in their right minds?”', 'he said they were.', '“and this isn’t an asylum?  i mean, it isn’t a place where theycure crazy people?”', 'he said it wasn’t.', '“well, then,” i said, “either i am a lunatic, or something justas awful has happened.  now tell me, honest and true, where am i?”', '“in king arthur’s court.”', 'i waited a minute, to let that idea shudder its way home,and then said:', '“and according to your notions, what year is it now?”', '“528--nineteenth of june.”', 'i felt a mournful sinking at the heart, and muttered: “i shallnever see my friends again--never, never again.  they will notbe born for more than thirteen hundred years yet.”', 'i seemed to believe the boy, i didn’t know why.  _something_ in meseemed to believe him--my consciousness, as you may say; but myreason didn’t.  my reason straightway began to clamor; that wasnatural.  i didn’t know how to go about satisfying it, becausei knew that the testimony of men wouldn’t serve--my reason wouldsay they were lunatics, and throw out their evidence.  but allof a sudden i stumbled on the very thing, just by luck.  i knewthat the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of thesixth century occurred on the 21st of june, a.d. 528, o.s., andbegan at 3 minutes after 12 noon.  i also knew that no total eclipseof the sun was due in what to _me_ was the present year--i.e., 1879.so, if i could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heartout of me for forty-eight hours, i should then find out for certainwhether this boy was telling me the truth or not.', 'wherefore, being a practical connecticut man, i now shoved thiswhole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hourshould come, in order that i might turn all my attention to thecircumstances of the present moment, and be alert and ready tomake the most out of them that could be made.  one thing at a time,is my motto--and just play that thing for all it is worth, evenif it’s only two pair and a jack.  i made up my mind to two things:if it was still the nineteenth century and i was among lunaticsand couldn’t get away, i would presently boss that asylum or knowthe reason why; and if, on the other hand, it was really the sixthcentury, all right, i didn’t want any softer thing: i would bossthe whole country inside of three months; for i judged i wouldhave the start of the best-educated man in the kingdom by a matterof thirteen hundred years and upward.  i’m not a man to wastetime after my mind’s made up and there’s work on hand; so i saidto the page:', '“now, clarence, my boy--if that might happen to be your name--i’ll get you to post me up a little if you don’t mind.  what isthe name of that apparition that brought me here?”', '“my master and thine?  that is the good knight and great lordsir kay the seneschal, foster brother to our liege the king.”', '“very good; go on, tell me everything.”', 'he made a long story of it; but the part that had immediate interestfor me was this: he said i was sir kay’s prisoner, and thatin the due course of custom i would be flung into a dungeon andleft there on scant commons until my friends ransomed me--unlessi chanced to rot, first.  i saw that the last chance had the bestshow, but i didn’t waste any bother about that; time was tooprecious.  the page said, further, that dinner was about endedin the great hall by this time, and that as soon as the sociabilityand the heavy drinking should begin, sir kay would have me in andexhibit me before king arthur and his illustrious knights seated atthe table round, and would brag about his exploit in capturingme, and would probably exaggerate the facts a little, but itwouldn’t be good form for me to correct him, and not over safe,either; and when i was done being exhibited, then ho for thedungeon; but he, clarence, would find a way to come and see me everynow and then, and cheer me up, and help me get word to my friends.', 'get word to my friends!  i thanked him; i couldn’t do less; andabout this time a lackey came to say i was wanted; so clarenceled me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me.', 'well, it was a curious kind of spectacle, and interesting. it wasan immense place, and rather naked--yes, and full of loud contrasts.it was very, very lofty; so lofty that the banners depending fromthe arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort oftwilight; there was a stone-railed gallery at each end, high up,with musicians in the one, and women, clothed in stunning colors,in the other.  the floor was of big stone flags laid in black andwhite squares, rather battered by age and use, and needing repair.as to ornament, there wasn’t any, strictly speaking; though onthe walls hung some huge tapestries which were probably taxedas works of art; battle-pieces, they were, with horses shaped likethose which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread;with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented byround holes--so that the man’s coat looks as if it had been donewith a biscuit-punch.  there was a fireplace big enough to camp in;and its projecting sides and hood, of carved and pillared stonework,had the look of a cathedral door.  along the walls stood men-at-arms,in breastplate and morion, with halberds for their only weapon--rigid as statues; and that is what they looked like.', 'in the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oakentable which they called the table round.  it was as large asa circus ring; and around it sat a great company of men dressedin such various and splendid colors that it hurt one’s eyes to lookat them.  they wore their plumed hats, right along, except thatwhenever one addressed himself directly to the king, he liftedhis hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark.', 'mainly they were drinking--from entire ox horns; but a few werestill munching bread or gnawing beef bones.  there was aboutan average of two dogs to one man; and these sat in expectantattitudes till a spent bone was flung to them, and then they wentfor it by brigades and divisions, with a rush, and there ensueda fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos ofplunging heads and bodies and flashing tails, and the storm ofhowlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time; but thatwas no matter, for the dog-fight was always a bigger interestanyway; the men rose, sometimes, to observe it the better and beton it, and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves outover their balusters with the same object; and all broke intodelighted ejaculations from time to time. in the end, the winningdog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between hispaws, and proceeded to growl over it, and gnaw it, and greasethe floor with it, just as fifty others were already doing; and therest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments.', 'as a rule, the speech and behavior of these people were graciousand courtly; and i noticed that they were good and serious listenerswhen anybody was telling anything--i mean in a dog-fightlessinterval.  and plainly, too, they were a childlike and innocent lot;telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle andwinning naivety, and ready and willing to listen to anybody else’slie, and believe it, too.  it was hard to associate them withanything cruel or dreadful; and yet they dealt in tales of bloodand suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forgetto shudder.', 'i was not the only prisoner present.  there were twenty or more.poor devils, many of them were maimed, hacked, carved, in a frightfulway; and their hair, their faces, their clothing, were caked withblack and stiffened drenchings of blood.  they were sufferingsharp physical pain, of course; and weariness, and hunger andthirst, no doubt; and at least none had given them the comfortof a wash, or even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds;yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan, or saw them showany sign of restlessness, or any disposition to complain.  thethought was forced upon me: “the rascals--_they_ have served otherpeople so in their day; it being their own turn, now, they werenot expecting any better treatment than this; so their philosophicalbearing is not an outcome of mental training, intellectual fortitude,reasoning; it is mere animal training; they are white indians.”', '', 'chapter iii', 'knights of the table round', 'mainly the round table talk was monologues--narrative accountsof the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and theirfriends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor.as a general thing--as far as i could make out--these murderousadventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor tosettle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they weresimply duels between strangers--duels between people who had nevereven been introduced to each other, and between whom existed nocause of offense whatever.  many a time i had seen a couple of boys,strangers, meet by chance, and say simultaneously, “i can lick you,” and go at it on the spot; but i had always imagined until now thatthat sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign andmark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to itand taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond.  yet therewas something very engaging about these great simple-heartedcreatures, something attractive and lovable.  there did not seemto be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to baita fish-hook with; but you didn’t seem to mind that, after a little,because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a societylike that, and indeed would have marred it, hindered it, spoiledits symmetry--perhaps rendered its existence impossible.', 'there was a fine manliness observable in almost every face; andin some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked yourbelittling criticisms and stilled them.  a most noble benignityand purity reposed in the countenance of him they called sir galahad,and likewise in the king’s also; and there was majesty and greatnessin the giant frame and high bearing of sir launcelot of the lake.', 'there was presently an incident which centered the general interestupon this sir launcelot.  at a sign from a sort of master ofceremonies, six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forwardin a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands towardthe ladies’ gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen.the most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flower-bedof feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent,and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and hisfellows into her hands for free pardon, ransom, captivity, or death,as she in her good pleasure might elect; and this, as he said, hewas doing by command of sir kay the seneschal, whose prisonersthey were, he having vanquished them by his single might andprowess in sturdy conflict in the field.', 'surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all overthe house; the queen’s gratified smile faded out at the name ofsir kay, and she looked disappointed; and the page whispered inmy ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision--', '“sir _kay_, forsooth!  oh, call me pet names, dearest, call mea marine!  in twice a thousand years shall the unholy inventionof man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie!”', 'every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon sir kay. but hewas equal to the occasion.  he got up and played his hand likea major--and took every trick.  he said he would state the caseexactly according to the facts; he would tell the simplestraightforward tale, without comment of his own; “and then,” said he, “if ye find glory and honor due, ye will give it unto himwho is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield orstrake with sword in the ranks of christian battle--even him thatsitteth there!” and he pointed to sir launcelot.  ah, he fetchedthem; it was a rattling good stroke.  then he went on and toldhow sir launcelot, seeking adventures, some brief time gone by,killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword, and set a hundredand forty-two captive maidens free; and then went further, stillseeking adventures, and found him (sir kay) fighting a desperatefight against nine foreign knights, and straightway took the battlesolely into his own hands, and conquered the nine; and that nightsir launcelot rose quietly, and dressed him in sir kay’s armor andtook sir kay’s horse and gat him away into distant lands, andvanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-fourin another; and all these and the former nine he made to swearthat about whitsuntide they would ride to arthur’s court and yieldthem to queen guenever’s hands as captives of sir kay the seneschal,spoil of his knightly prowess; and now here were these half dozen,and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed oftheir desperate wounds.', 'well, it was touching to see the queen blush and smile, and lookembarrassed and happy, and fling furtive glances at sir launcelotthat would have got him shot in arkansas, to a dead certainty.', 'everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of sir launcelot; andas for me, i was perfectly amazed, that one man, all by himself,should have been able to beat down and capture such battalionsof practiced fighters.  i said as much to clarence; but this mockingfeatherhead only said:', '“an sir kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him,ye had seen the accompt doubled.”', 'i looked at the boy in sorrow; and as i looked i saw the cloud ofa deep despondency settle upon his countenance.  i followed thedirection of his eye, and saw that a very old and white-beardedman, clothed in a flowing black gown, had risen and was standingat the table upon unsteady legs, and feebly swaying his ancienthead and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye.the same suffering look that was in the page’s face was observablein all the faces around--the look of dumb creatures who know thatthey must endure and make no moan.', '“marry, we shall have it again,” sighed the boy; “that same oldweary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words,and that he _will_ tell till he dieth, every time he hath gotten hisbarrel full and feeleth his exaggeration-mill a-working.  wouldgod i had died or i saw this day!”', '“who is it?”', '“merlin, the mighty liar and magician, perdition singe him forthe weariness he worketh with his one tale!  but that men fearhim for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all thedevils that be in hell at his beck and call, they would have dughis entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale andsquelch it.  he telleth it always in the third person, makingbelieve he is too modest to glorify himself--maledictions lightupon him, misfortune be his dole!  good friend, prithee call mefor evensong.”', 'the boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to goto sleep.  the old man began his tale; and presently the lad wasasleep in reality; so also were the dogs, and the court, the lackeys,and the files of men-at-arms.  the droning voice droned on; a softsnoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subduedaccompaniment of wind instruments.  some heads were bowed uponfolded arms, some lay back with open mouths that issued unconsciousmusic; the flies buzzed and bit, unmolested, the rats swarmedsoftly out from a hundred holes, and pattered about, and madethemselves at home everywhere; and one of them sat up like asquirrel on the king’s head and held a bit of cheese in its handsand nibbled it, and dribbled the crumbs in the king’s face withnaive and impudent irreverence.  it was a tranquil scene, andrestful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit.', 'this was the old man’s tale.  he said:', '“right so the king and merlin departed, and went until an hermitthat was a good man and a great leech.  so the hermit searchedall his wounds and gave him good salves; so the king was therethree days, and then were his wounds well amended that he mightride and go, and so departed.  and as they rode, arthur said,i have no sword.  no force,* [*footnote from m.t.: no matter.]said merlin, hereby is a sword that shall be yours and i may.so they rode till they came to a lake, the which was a fair waterand broad, and in the midst of the lake arthur was ware of an armclothed in white samite, that held a fair sword in that hand.lo, said merlin, yonder is that sword that i spake of.  with thatthey saw a damsel going upon the lake.  what damsel is that?said arthur.  that is the lady of the lake, said merlin; and withinthat lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on earth,and richly beseen, and this damsel will come to you anon, and thenspeak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword.  anonwithal came the damsel unto arthur and saluted him, and he heragain.  damsel, said arthur, what sword is that, that yonderthe arm holdeth above the water?  i would it were mine, for i haveno sword.  sir arthur king, said the damsel, that sword is mine,and if ye will give me a gift when i ask it you, ye shall have it.by my faith, said arthur, i will give you what gift ye will ask.well, said the damsel, go ye into yonder barge and row yourselfto the sword, and take it and the scabbard with you, and i will askmy gift when i see my time.  so sir arthur and merlin alight, andtied their horses to two trees, and so they went into the ship,and when they came to the sword that the hand held, sir arthurtook it up by the handles, and took it with him.  and the armand the hand went under the water; and so they came unto the landand rode forth.  and then sir arthur saw a rich pavilion.  whatsignifieth yonder pavilion?  it is the knight’s pavilion, saidmerlin, that ye fought with last, sir pellinore, but he is out,he is not there; he hath ado with a knight of yours, that hightegglame, and they have fought together, but at the last egglamefled, and else he had been dead, and he hath chased him evento carlion, and we shall meet with him anon in the highway.  thatis well said, said arthur, now have i a sword, now will i wagebattle with him, and be avenged on him.  sir, ye shall not so,said merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing, sothat ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also, he willnot lightly be matched of one knight living; and therefore it is mycounsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good service in shorttime, and his sons, after his days.  also ye shall see that dayin short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sisterto wed.  when i see him, i will do as ye advise me, said arthur.then sir arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well.whether liketh you better, said merlin, the sword or the scabbard?me liketh better the sword, said arthur.  ye are more unwise,said merlin, for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword, for whileye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood, be yenever so sore wounded; therefore, keep well the scabbard alwayswith you.  so they rode into carlion, and by the way they met withsir pellinore; but merlin had done such a craft that pellinore sawnot arthur, and he passed by without any words.  i marvel, saidarthur, that the knight would not speak.  sir, said merlin, he sawyou not; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed.  sothey came unto carlion, whereof his knights were passing glad.and when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he wouldjeopard his person so alone.  but all men of worship said it wasmerry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person inadventure as other poor knights did.”', '', 'chapter iv', 'sir dinadan the humorist', 'it seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifullytold; but then i had heard it only once, and that makes a difference;it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh, no doubt.', 'sir dinadan the humorist was the first to awake, and he soon rousedthe rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality.he tied some metal mugs to a dog’s tail and turned him loose,and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright,with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering andcrashing against everything that came in their way and makingaltogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din andturmoil; at which every man and woman of the multitude laughedtill the tears flowed, and some fell out of their chairs andwallowed on the floor in ecstasy.  it was just like so many children.sir dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keepfrom telling over and over again, to weariness, how the immortalidea happened to occur to him; and as is the way with humoristsof his breed, he was still laughing at it after everybody else hadgot through.  he was so set up that he concluded to make a speech--of course a humorous speech.  i think i never heard so many oldplayed-out jokes strung together in my life.  he was worse thanthe minstrels, worse than the clown in the circus.  it seemedpeculiarly sad to sit here, thirteen hundred years before i wasborn, and listen again to poor, flat, worm-eaten jokes that hadgiven me the dry gripes when i was a boy thirteen hundred yearsafterwards.  it about convinced me that there isn’t any such thingas a new joke possible.  everybody laughed at these antiquities--but then they always do; i had noticed that, centuries later.however, of course the scoffer didn’t laugh--i mean the boy.  no,he scoffed; there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t scoff at. he saidthe most of sir dinadan’s jokes were rotten and the rest werepetrified.  i said “petrified” was good; as i believed, myself,that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some ofthose jokes was by geologic periods.  but that neat idea hitthe boy in a blank place, for geology hadn’t been invented yet.however, i made a note of the remark, and calculated to educatethe commonwealth up to it if i pulled through.  it is no useto throw a good thing away merely because the market isn’t ripe yet.', 'now sir kay arose and began to fire up on his history-mill with mefor fuel.  it was time for me to feel serious, and i did.  sir kaytold how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians, whoall wore the same ridiculous garb that i did--a garb that was a workof enchantment, and intended to make the wearer secure from hurtby human hands.  however he had nullified the force of theenchantment by prayer, and had killed my thirteen knights ina three hours’ battle, and taken me prisoner, sparing my lifein order that so strange a curiosity as i was might be exhibitedto the wonder and admiration of the king and the court.  he spokeof me all the time, in the blandest way, as “this prodigious giant,” and “this horrible sky-towering monster,” and “this tusked andtaloned man-devouring ogre”, and everybody took in all this boshin the naivest way, and never smiled or seemed to notice thatthere was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me.he said that in trying to escape from him i sprang into the top ofa tree two hundred cubits high at a single bound, but he dislodgedme with a stone the size of a cow, which “all-to brast” the mostof my bones, and then swore me to appear at arthur’s court forsentence.  he ended by condemning me to die at noon on the 21st;and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn beforehe named the date.', 'i was in a dismal state by this time; indeed, i was hardly enoughin my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up asto how i had better be killed, the possibility of the killing beingdoubted by some, because of the enchantment in my clothes. and yetit was nothing but an ordinary suit of fifteen-dollar slop-shops.still, i was sane enough to notice this detail, to wit: many ofthe terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this greatassemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land wouldhave made a comanche blush.  indelicacy is too mild a term to conveythe idea.  however, i had read “tom jones,” and “roderick random,” and other books of that kind, and knew that the highest and firstladies and gentlemen in england had remained little or no cleanerin their talk, and in the morals and conduct which such talkimplies, clear up to a hundred years ago; in fact clear into ourown nineteenth century--in which century, broadly speaking,the earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverablein english history--or in european history, for that matter--may besaid to have made their appearance.  suppose sir walter, insteadof putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters,had allowed the characters to speak for themselves?  we shouldhave had talk from rebecca and ivanhoe and the soft lady rowenawhich would embarrass a tramp in our day.  however, to theunconsciously indelicate all things are delicate.  king arthur’speople were not aware that they were indecent and i had presenceof mind enough not to mention it.', 'they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they weremightily relieved, at last, when old merlin swept the difficultyaway for them with a common-sense hint.  he asked them why theywere so dull--why didn’t it occur to them to strip me.  in half aminute i was as naked as a pair of tongs!  and dear, dear, to thinkof it: i was the only embarrassed person there.  everybody discussedme; and did it as unconcernedly as if i had been a cabbage.queen guenever was as naively interested as the rest, and saidshe had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before.  it wasthe only compliment i got--if it was a compliment.', 'finally i was carried off in one direction, and my perilous clothesin another.  i was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon,with some scant remnants for dinner, some moldy straw for a bed,and no end of rats for company.', '', 'chapter v', 'an inspiration', 'i was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long.', 'when i next came to myself, i seemed to have been asleep a verylong time.  my first thought was, “well, what an astonishing dreami’ve had!  i reckon i’ve waked only just in time to keep frombeing hanged or drowned or burned or something....  i’ll nap againtill the whistle blows, and then i’ll go down to the arms factoryand have it out with hercules.”', 'but just then i heard the harsh music of rusty chains and bolts,a light flashed in my eyes, and that butterfly, clarence, stoodbefore me!  i gasped with surprise; my breath almost got away from me.', '“what!” i said, “you here yet?  go along with the rest ofthe dream! scatter!”', 'but he only laughed, in his light-hearted way, and fell to makingfun of my sorry plight.', '“all right,” i said resignedly, “let the dream go on; i’m in no hurry.”', '“prithee what dream?”', '“what dream?  why, the dream that i am in arthur’s court--a personwho never existed; and that i am talking to you, who are nothingbut a work of the imagination.”', '“oh, la, indeed! and is it a dream that you’re to be burnedto-morrow?  ho-ho--answer me that!”', 'the shock that went through me was distressing.  i now beganto reason that my situation was in the last degree serious, dreamor no dream; for i knew by past experience of the lifelike intensityof dreams, that to be burned to death, even in a dream, would bevery far from being a jest, and was a thing to be avoided, by anymeans, fair or foul, that i could contrive.  so i said beseechingly:', '“ah, clarence, good boy, only friend i’ve got,--for you _are_ myfriend, aren’t you?--don’t fail me; help me to devise some wayof escaping from this place!”', '“now do but hear thyself!  escape?  why, man, the corridors arein guard and keep of men-at-arms.”', '“no doubt, no doubt.  but how many, clarence?  not many, i hope?”', '“full a score.  one may not hope to escape.”  after a pause--hesitatingly: “and there be other reasons--and weightier.”', '“other ones? what are they?”', '“well, they say--oh, but i daren’t, indeed daren’t!”', '“why, poor lad, what is the matter?  why do you blench?  why doyou tremble so?”', '“oh, in sooth, there is need!  i do want to tell you, but--”', '“come, come, be brave, be a man--speak out, there’s a good lad!”', 'he hesitated, pulled one way by desire, the other way by fear;then he stole to the door and peeped out, listening; and finallycrept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me hisfearful news in a whisper, and with all the cowering apprehensionof one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of thingswhose very mention might be freighted with death.', '“merlin, in his malice, has woven a spell about this dungeon, andthere bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperateenough to essay to cross its lines with you!  now god pity me,i have told it!  ah, be kind to me, be merciful to a poor boy whomeans thee well; for an thou betray me i am lost!”', 'i laughed the only really refreshing laugh i had had for some time;and shouted:', '“merlin has wrought a spell!  _merlin_, forsooth!  that cheap oldhumbug, that maundering old ass?  bosh, pure bosh, the silliest boshin the world!  why, it does seem to me that of all the childish,idiotic, chuckle-headed, chicken-livered superstitions that ev--oh, damn merlin!”', 'but clarence had slumped to his knees before i had half finished,and he was like to go out of his mind with fright.', '“oh, beware!  these are awful words!  any moment these wallsmay crumble upon us if you say such things.  oh call them backbefore it is too late!”', 'now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me tothinking.  if everybody about here was so honestly and sincerelyafraid of merlin’s pretended magic as clarence was, certainlya superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrivesome way to take advantage of such a state of things.  i wenton thinking, and worked out a plan. then i said:', '“get up.  pull yourself together; look me in the eye.  do youknow why i laughed?”', '“no--but for our blessed lady’s sake, do it no more.”', '“well, i’ll tell you why i laughed.  because i’m a magician myself.”', '“thou!”  the boy recoiled a step, and caught his breath, forthe thing hit him rather sudden;

the thing was out of the question.  soi asked time to consider.  the king said:', '“how long--ah, how long, good sir?  be merciful; look, it growethdarker, moment by moment.  prithee how long?”', '“not long.  half an hour--maybe an hour.”', 'there were a thousand pathetic protests, but i couldn’t shorten upany, for i couldn’t remember how long a total eclipse lasts.  i wasin a puzzled condition, anyway, and wanted to think.  somethingwas wrong about that eclipse, and the fact was very unsettling.if this wasn’t the one i was after, how was i to tell whether thiswas the sixth century, or nothing but a dream?  dear me, if i couldonly prove it was the latter!  here was a glad new hope.  if the boywas right about the date, and this was surely the 20th, it _wasn’t_the sixth century.  i reached for the monk’s sleeve, in considerableexcitement, and asked him what day of the month it was.', 'hang him, he said it was the _twenty-first_!  it made me turn coldto hear him.  i begged him not to make any mistake about it; buthe was sure; he knew it was the 21st.  so, that feather-headedboy had botched things again!  the time of the day was rightfor the eclipse; i had seen that for myself, in the beginning,by the dial that was near by.  yes, i was in king arthur’s court,and i might as well make the most out of it i could.', 'the darkness was steadily growing, the people becoming more andmore distressed.  i now said:', '“i have reflected, sir king.  for a lesson, i will let this darknessproceed, and spread night in the world; but whether i blot outthe sun for good, or restore it, shall rest with you.  these arethe terms, to wit: you shall remain king over all your dominions,and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship;but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive,and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increaseof revenue over and above its present amount as i may succeedin creating for the state.  if i can’t live on that, i sha’n’t askanybody to give me a lift.  is it satisfactory?”', 'there was a prodigious roar of applause, and out of the midstof it the king’s voice rose, saying:', '“away with his bonds, and set him free! and do him homage, highand low, rich and poor, for he is become the king’s right hand,is clothed with power and authority, and his seat is upon the higheststep of the throne!  now sweep away this creeping night, and bringthe light and cheer again, that all the world may bless thee.”', 'but i said:', '“that a common man should be shamed before the world, is nothing;but it were dishonor to the _king_ if any that saw his minister nakedshould not also see him delivered from his shame.  if i might askthat my clothes be brought again--”', '“they are not meet,” the king broke in.  “fetch raiment of anothersort; clothe him like a prince!”', 'my idea worked.  i wanted to keep things as they were till theeclipse was total, otherwise they would be trying again to getme to dismiss the darkness, and of course i couldn’t do it.  sendingfor the clothes gained some delay, but not enough.  so i had to makeanother excuse.  i said it would be but natural if the king shouldchange his mind and repent to some extent of what he had doneunder excitement; therefore i would let the darkness grow a while,and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mindthe same, the darkness should be dismissed.  neither the king noranybody else was satisfied with that arrangement, but i hadto stick to my point.', 'it grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker, while i struggledwith those awkward sixth-century clothes.  it got to be pitch dark,at last, and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the colduncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the starscome out and twinkle in the sky.  at last the eclipse was total,and i was very glad of it, but everybody else was in misery; whichwas quite natural. i said:', '“the king, by his silence, still stands to the terms.”  theni lifted up my hands--stood just so a moment--then i said, withthe most awful solemnity: “let the enchantment dissolve andpass harmless away!”', 'there was no response, for a moment, in that deep darkness andthat graveyard hush.  but when the silver rim of the sun pusheditself out, a moment or two later, the assemblage broke loose witha vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother mewith blessings and gratitude; and clarence was not the last ofthe wash, to be sure.', '', 'chapter vii', 'merlin’s tower', 'inasmuch as i was now the second personage in the kingdom, as faras political power and authority were concerned, much was madeof me.  my raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold,and by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable.  but habitwould soon reconcile me to my clothes; i was aware of that.  i wasgiven the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, afterthe king’s.  they were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings,but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet,and they were misfit rushes at that, being not all of one breed.as for conveniences, properly speaking, there weren’t any.  i mean_little_ conveniences; it is the little conveniences that makethe real comfort of life.  the big oaken chairs, graced with rudecarvings, were well enough, but that was the stopping place.there was no soap, no matches, no looking-glass--except a metalone, about as powerful as a pail of water.  and not a chromo.i had been used to chromos for years, and i saw now that withoutmy suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabricof my being, and was become a part of me.  it made me homesickto look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrennessand remember that in our house in east hartford, all unpretendingas it was, you couldn’t go into a room but you would find aninsurance-chromo, or at least a three-color god-bless-our-homeover the door; and in the parlor we had nine.  but here, even inmy grand room of state, there wasn’t anything in the nature ofa picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt, which was eitherwoven or knitted (it had darned places in it), and nothing in itwas the right color or the right shape; and as for proportions,even raphael himself couldn’t have botched them more formidably,after all his practice on those nightmares they call his “celebratedhampton court cartoons.”  raphael was a bird.  we had severalof his chromos; one was his “miraculous draught of fishes,” wherehe puts in a miracle of his own--puts three men into a canoe whichwouldn’t have held a dog without upsetting.  i always admiredto study r.’s art, it was so fresh and unconventional.', 'there wasn’t even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle.  i hada great many servants, and those that were on duty lolled in theanteroom; and when i wanted one of them i had to go and call for him.there was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half fullof boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it wasthe thing that produced what was regarded as light.  a lot ofthese hung along the walls and modified the dark, just toned itdown enough to make it dismal.  if you went out at night, yourservants carried torches.  there were no books, pens, paper orink, and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows.it is a little thing--glass is--until it is absent, then it becomesa big thing.  but perhaps the worst of all was, that there wasn’tany sugar, coffee, tea, or tobacco.  i saw that i was just anotherrobinson crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with no societybut some more or less tame animals, and if i wanted to make lifebearable i must do as he did--invent, contrive, create, reorganizethings; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy.  well,that was in my line.', 'one thing troubled me along at first--the immense interest whichpeople took in me.  apparently the whole nation wanted a lookat me.  it soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the britishworld almost to death; that while it lasted the whole country,from one end to the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, andthe churches, hermitages, and monkeries overflowed with prayingand weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world wascome.  then had followed the news that the producer of this awfulevent was a stranger, a mighty magician at arthur’s court; that hecould have blown out the sun like a candle, and was just goingto do it when his mercy was purchased, and he then dissolvedhis enchantments, and was now recognized and honored as the manwho had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction andits peoples from extinction.  now if you consider that everybodybelieved that, and not only believed it, but never even dreamedof doubting it, you will easily understand that there was nota person in all britain that would not have walked fifty milesto get a sight of me.  of course i was all the talk--all othersubjects were dropped; even the king became suddenly a person ofminor interest and notoriety.  within twenty-four hours thedelegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnightthey kept coming.  the village was crowded, and all the countryside.i had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to thesereverent and awe-stricken multitudes.  it came to be a great burden,as to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same timecompensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a centerof homage.  it turned brer merlin green with envy and spite, whichwas a great satisfaction to me.  but there was one thing i couldn’tunderstand--nobody had asked for an autograph.  i spoke to clarenceabout it.  by george!  i had to explain to him what it was.  thenhe said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozenpriests.  land! think of that.', 'there was another thing that troubled me a little.  those multitudespresently began to agitate for another miracle.  that was natural.to be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that theyhad seen the man who could command the sun, riding in the heavens,and be obeyed, would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors,and envied by them all; but to be able to also say they had seenhim work a miracle themselves--why, people would come a distanceto see _them_.  the pressure got to be pretty strong.  there wasgoing to be an eclipse of the moon, and i knew the date and hour,but it was too far away.  two years.  i would have given a gooddeal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there wasa big market for it.  it seemed a great pity to have it wasted so,and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn’t have anyuse for it, as like as not.  if it had been booked for only a monthaway, i could have sold it short; but, as matters stood, i couldn’tseem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good, so i gave uptrying.  next, clarence found that old merlin was making himselfbusy on the sly among those people.  he was spreading a report thati was a humbug, and that the reason i didn’t accommodate the peoplewith a miracle was because i couldn’t.  i saw that i must dosomething.  i presently thought out a plan.', 'by my authority as executive i threw merlin into prison--the samecell i had occupied myself.  then i gave public notice by heraldand trumpet that i should be busy with affairs of state fora fortnight, but about the end of that time i would take a moment’sleisure and blow up merlin’s stone tower by fires from heaven;in the meantime, whoso listened to evil reports about me, let himbeware.  furthermore, i would perform but this one miracle atthis time, and no more; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured,i would turn the murmurers into horses, and make them useful.quiet ensued.', 'i took clarence into my confidence, to a certain degree, and wewent to work privately.  i told him that this was a sort of miraclethat required a trifle of preparation, and that it would be suddendeath to ever talk about these preparations to anybody.  that madehis mouth safe enough.  clandestinely we made a few bushels offirst-rate blasting powder, and i superintended my armorers whilethey constructed a lightning-rod and some wires.  this old stonetower was very massive--and rather ruinous, too, for it was roman,and four hundred years old.  yes, and handsome, after a rudefashion, and clothed with ivy from base to summit, as with a shirtof scale mail.  it stood on a lonely eminence, in good view fromthe castle, and about half a mile away.', 'working by night, we stowed the powder in the tower--dug stonesout, on the inside, and buried the powder in the walls themselves,which were fifteen feet thick at the base.  we put in a peckat a time, in a dozen places.  we could have blown up the towerof london with these charges.  when the thirteenth night was comewe put up our lightning-rod, bedded it in one of the batches ofpowder, and ran wires from it to the other batches.  everybodyhad shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation, buton the morning of the fourteenth i thought best to warn the people,through the heralds, to keep clear away--a quarter of a mile away.then added, by command, that at some time during the twenty-fourhours i would consummate the miracle, but would first give a briefnotice; by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime, bytorch-baskets in the same places if at night.', 'thunder-showers had been tolerably frequent of late, and i wasnot much afraid of a failure; still, i shouldn’t have cared fora delay of a day or two; i should have explained that i was busywith affairs of state yet, and the people must wait.', 'of course, we had a blazing sunny day--almost the first one withouta cloud for three weeks; things always happen so.  i kept secluded,and watched the weather.  clarence dropped in from time to timeand said the public excitement was growing and growing all thetime, and the whole country filling up with human masses as faras one could see from the battlements.  at last the wind sprang upand a cloud appeared--in the right quarter, too, and just atnightfall.  for a little while i watched that distant cloud spreadand blacken, then i judged it was time for me to appear.  i orderedthe torch-baskets to be lit, and merlin liberated and sent to me.a quarter of an hour later i ascended the parapet and there foundthe king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darknesstoward merlin’s tower.  already the darkness was so heavy thatone could not see far; these people and the old turrets, beingpartly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the greattorch-baskets overhead, made a good deal of a picture.', 'merlin arrived in a gloomy mood.  i said:', '“you wanted to burn me alive when i had not done you any harm,and latterly you have been trying to injure my professionalreputation.  therefore i am going to call down fire and blow upyour tower, but it is only fair to give you a chance; now if youthink you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires, stepto the bat, it’s your innings.”', '“i can, fair sir, and i will. doubt it not.”', 'he drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof, and burnta pinch of powder in it, which sent up a small cloud of aromaticsmoke, whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselvesand get uncomfortable.  then he began to mutter and make passesin the air with his hands.  he worked himself up slowly andgradually into a sort of frenzy, and got to thrashing around withhis arms like the sails of a windmill.  by this time the storm hadabout reached us; the gusts of wind were flaring the torches andmaking the shadows swash about, the first heavy drops of rainwere falling, the world abroad was black as pitch, the lightningbegan to wink fitfully.  of course, my rod would be loading itselfnow.  in fact, things were imminent. so i said:', '“you have had time enough.  i have given you every advantage,and not interfered.  it is plain your magic is weak. it is onlyfair that i begin now.”', 'i made about three passes in the air, and then there was an awfulcrash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks, alongwith a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday,and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the groundin a general collapse of consternation.  well, it rained mortar andmasonry the rest of the week.  this was the report; but probablythe facts would have modified it.', 'it was an effective miracle.  the great bothersome temporarypopulation vanished.  there were a good many thousand tracksin the mud the next morning, but they were all outward bound.if i had advertised another miracle i couldn’t have raised anaudience with a sheriff.', 'merlin’s stock was flat.  the king wanted to stop his wages; heeven wanted to banish him, but i interfered.  i said he would beuseful to work the weather, and attend to small matters like that,and i would give him a lift now and then when his poor littleparlor-magic soured on him.  there wasn’t a rag of his tower left,but i had the government rebuild it for him, and advised himto take boarders; but he was too high-toned for that.  and as forbeing grateful, he never even said thank you.  he was a ratherhard lot, take him how you might; but then you couldn’t fairlyexpect a man to be sweet that had been set back so.', '', 'chapter viii', 'the boss', 'to be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing; but to havethe on-looking world consent to it is a finer.  the tower episodesolidified my power, and made it impregnable.  if any were perchancedisposed to be jealous and critical before that, they experienceda change of heart, now.  there was not any one in the kingdomwho would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters.', 'i was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances.for a time, i used to wake up, mornings, and smile at my “dream,” and listen for the colt’s factory whistle; but that sort of thingplayed itself out, gradually, and at last i was fully able to realizethat i was actually living in the sixth century, and in arthur’scourt, not a lunatic asylum.  after that, i was just as muchat home in that century as i could have been in any other; andas for preference, i wouldn’t have traded it for the twentieth.look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge, brains,pluck, and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country.the grandest field that ever was; and all my own; not a competitor;not a man who wasn’t a baby to me in acquirements and capacities;whereas, what would i amount to in the twentieth century?  i shouldbe foreman of a factory, that is about all; and could drag a seinedown street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself.', 'what a jump i had made!  i couldn’t keep from thinking about it,and contemplating it, just as one does who has struck oil.  therewas nothing back of me that could approach it, unless it might bejoseph’s case; and joseph’s only approached it, it didn’t equalit, quite.  for it stands to reason that as joseph’s splendidfinancial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king, the generalpublic must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor, whereasi had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun, and waspopular by reason of it.', 'i was no shadow of a king; i was the substance; the king himselfwas the shadow.  my power was colossal; and it was not a merename, as such things have generally been, it was the genuinearticle.  i stood here, at the very spring and source of the secondgreat period of the world’s history; and could see the tricklingstream of that history gather and deepen and broaden, and rollits mighty tides down the far centuries; and i could note theupspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its longarray of thrones: de montforts, gavestons, mortimers, villierses;the war-making, campaign-directing wantons of france, and charlesthe second’s scepter-wielding drabs; but nowhere in the processionwas my full-sized fellow visible.  i was a unique; and glad to knowthat that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteencenturies and a half, for sure.  yes, in power i was equal tothe king.  at the same time there was another power that wasa trifle stronger than both of us put together.  that was the church.i do not wish to disguise that fact.  i couldn’t, if i wanted to.but never mind about that, now; it will show up, in its properplace, later on.  it didn’t cause me any trouble in the beginning--at least any of consequence.', 'well, it was a curious country, and full of interest.  and thepeople!  they were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race;why, they were nothing but rabbits.  it was pitiful for a personborn in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humbleand hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and churchand nobility; as if they had any more occasion to love and honorking and church and noble than a slave has to love and honorthe lash, or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him!why, dear me, _any_ kind of royalty, howsoever modified, _any_ kindof aristocracy, howsoever pruned, is rightly an insult; but if youare born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probablynever find it out for yourself, and don’t believe it when somebodyelse tells you.  it is enough to make a body ashamed of his raceto think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its throneswithout shadow of right or reason, and the seventh-rate peoplethat have always figured as its aristocracies--a company of monarchsand nobles who, as a rule, would have achieved only poverty andobscurity if left, like their betters, to their own exertions.', 'the most of king arthur’s british nation were slaves, pure andsimple, and bore that name, and wore the iron collar on theirnecks; and the rest were slaves in fact, but without the name;they imagined themselves men and freemen, and called themselvesso.  the truth was, the nation as a body was in the world for oneobject, and one only: to grovel before king and church and noble;to slave for them, sweat blood for them, starve that they mightbe fed, work that they might play, drink misery to the dregs thatthey might be happy, go naked that they might wear silks andjewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them,be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and posturesof adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselvesthe gods of this world.  and for all this, the thanks they got werecuffs and contempt; and so poor-spirited were they that they tookeven this sort of attention as an honor.', 'inherited ideas are a curious thing, and interesting to observeand examine.  i had mine, the king and his people had theirs.in both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit,and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reasonand argument would have had a long contract on his hands.  forinstance, those people had inherited the idea that all men withouttitle and a long pedigree, whether they had great natural giftsand acquirements or hadn’t, were creatures of no more considerationthan so many animals, bugs, insects; whereas i had inherited the ideathat human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock-shamsof inherited dignities and unearned titles, are of no good butto be laughed at.  the way i was looked upon was odd, but it wasnatural.  you know how the keeper and the public regard the elephantin the menagerie: well, that is the idea.  they are full ofadmiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength; theyspeak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvelswhich are far and away beyond their own powers; and they speakwith the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is ableto drive a thousand men before him.  but does that make him oneof _them_?  no; the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile atthe idea.  he couldn’t comprehend it; couldn’t take it in; couldn’tin any remote way conceive of it.  well, to the king, the nobles,and all the nation, down to the very slaves and tramps, i wasjust that kind of an elephant, and nothing more.  i was admired,also feared; but it was as an animal is admired and feared.the animal is not reverenced, neither was i; i was not evenrespected.  i had no pedigree, no inherited title; so in the king’sand nobles’ eyes i was mere dirt; the people regarded me withwonder and awe, but there was no reverence mixed with it; throughthe force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive ofanything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship.there you see the hand of that awful power, the roman catholicchurch.  in two or three little centuries it had converted a nationof men to a nation of worms.  before the day of the church’ssupremacy in the world, men were men, and held their heads up,and had a man’s pride and spirit and independence; and whatof greatness and position a person got, he got mainly by achievement,not by birth.  but then the church came to the front, with an axeto grind; and she was wise, subtle, and knew more than one wayto skin a cat--or a nation; she invented “divine right of kings,” and propped it all around, brick by brick, with the beatitudes--wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortifyan evil one; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedienceto superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice; she preached (to thecommoner) meekness under insult; preached (still to the commoner,always to the commoner) patience, meanness of spirit, non-resistanceunder oppression; and she introduced heritable ranks andaristocracies, and taught all the christian populations of the earthto bow down to them and worship them.  even down to my birth-centurythat poison was still in the blood of christendom, and the bestof english commoners was still content to see his inferiorsimpudently continuing to hold a number of positions, such aslordships and the throne, to which the grotesque laws of his countrydid not allow him to aspire; in fact, he was not merely contentedwith this strange condition of things, he was even able to persuadehimself that he was proud of it.  it seems to show that there isn’tanything you can’t stand, if you are only born and bred to it.of course that taint, that reverence for rank and title, had beenin our american blood, too--i know that; but when i left americait had disappeared--at least to all intents and purposes.  theremnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses.  whena disease has worked its way down to that level, it may fairlybe said to be out of the system.', 'but to return to my anomalous position in king arthur’s kingdom.here i was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a masterintelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurementthe one and only actually great man in that whole british world;and yet there and then, just as in the remote england of mybirth-time, the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descentfrom a king’s leman, acquired at second-hand from the slums oflondon, was a better man than i was.  such a personage was fawnedupon in arthur’s realm and reverently looked up to by everybody,even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence,and his morals as base as his lineage.  there were times when_he_ could sit down in the king’s presence, but i couldn’t.  i couldhave got a title easily enough, and that would have raised mea large step in everybody’s eyes; even in the king’s, the giverof it.  but i didn’t ask for it; and i declined it when it wasoffered.  i couldn’t have enjoyed such a thing with my notions;and it wouldn’t have been fair, anyway, because as far back asi could go, our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister.i couldn’t have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proudand set-up over any title except one that should come from the nationitself, the only legitimate source; and such an one i hoped to win;and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor, i didwin it and did wear it with a high and clean pride.  this titlefell casually from the lips of a blacksmith, one day, in a village,was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouthwith a laugh and an affirmative vote; in ten days it had sweptthe kingdom, and was become as familiar as the king’s name.  i wasnever known by any other designation afterward, whether in thenation’s talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at thecouncil-board of the sovereign.  this title, translated into modernspeech, would be the boss.  elected by the nation.  that suited me.and it was a pretty high title.  there were very few the’s, andi was one of them.  if you spoke of the duke, or the earl, orthe bishop, how could anybody tell which one you meant?  but ifyou spoke of the king or the queen or the boss, it was different.', 'well, i liked the king, and as king i respected him--respectedthe office; at least respected it as much as i was capable ofrespecting any unearned supremacy; but as men i looked down uponhim and his nobles--privately.  and he and they liked me, andrespected my office; but as an animal, without birth or sham title,they looked down upon me--and were not particularly private about it,either.  i didn’t charge for my opinion about them, and they didn’tcharge for their opinion about me: the account was square, thebooks balanced, everybody was satisfied.', '', 'chapter ix', 'the tournament', 'they were always having grand tournaments there at camelot;

and both as business man and statesman i wantedto study the tournament and see if i couldn’t invent an improvementon it.  that reminds me to remark, in passing, that the very firstofficial thing i did, in my administration--and it was on the veryfirst day of it, too--was to start a patent office;

from the very ends of the country,and even from beyond the sea; and many brought ladies, and allbrought squires and troops of servants.  it was a most gaudy andgorgeous crowd, as to costumery, and very characteristic of thecountry and the time, in the way of high animal spirits, innocentindecencies of language, and happy-hearted indifference to morals.it was fight or look on, all day and every day; and sing, gamble,dance, carouse half the night every night.  they had a most noblegood time.  you never saw such people.  those banks of beautifulladies, shining in their barbaric splendors, would see a knightsprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thicknessof your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting, and insteadof fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for abetter view;

thereisn’t any way.  so i wanted to sample things, and be finding outwhat sort of reporter-material i might be able to rake together outof the sixth century when i should come to need it.', 'well, the priest did very well, considering.  he got in allthe details, and that is a good thing in a local item: you see,he had kept books for the undertaker-department of his churchwhen he was younger, and there, you know, the money’s in the details;the more details, the more swag: bearers, mutes, candles, prayers--everything counts; and if the bereaved don’t buy prayers enoughyou mark up your candles with a forked pencil, and your billshows up all right.  and he had a good knack at getting in thecomplimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likelyto advertise--no, i mean a knight that had influence;

but its antiquewording was quaint and sweet and simple, and full of the fragrancesand flavors of the time, and these little merits made up in a measurefor its more important lacks.  here is an extract from it:', '  then sir brian de les isles and grummore grummorsum,  knights of the castle, encountered with sir aglovale and  sir tor, and sir tor smote down sir grummore grummorsum  to the earth.  then came sir carados of the dolorous  tower, and sir turquine, knights of the castle, and  there encountered with them sir percivale de galis  and sir lamorak de galis, that were two brethren, and  there encountered sir percivale with sir carados, and  either brake their spears unto their hands, and then  sir turquine with sir lamorak, and either of them smote  down other, horse and all, to the earth, and either  parties rescued other and horsed them again.  and sir  arnold, and sir gauter, knights of the castle,  encountered with sir brandiles and sir kay, and these  four knights encountered mightily, and brake their  spears to their hands.  then came sir pertolope from  the castle, and there encountered with him sir lionel,  and there sir pertolope the green knight smote down sir  lionel, brother to sir launcelot.  all this was marked  by noble heralds, who bare him best, and their names.  then sir bleobaris brake his spear upon sir gareth,  but of that stroke sir bleobaris fell to the earth.  when sir galihodin saw that, he bad sir gareth keep him,  and sir gareth smote him to the earth.  then sir galihud  gat a spear to avenge his brother, and in the same wise  sir gareth served him, and sir dinadan and his brother  la cote male taile, and sir sagramore le disirous, and  sir dodinas le savage; all these he bare down with one  spear.  when king aswisance of ireland saw sir gareth  fare so he marvelled what he might be, that one time  seemed green, and another time, at his again coming,  he seemed blue.  and thus at every course that he rode  to and fro he changed his color, so that there might  neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him.  then sir agwisance the king of ireland encountered  with sir gareth, and there sir gareth smote him from  his horse, saddle and all.  and then came king carados  of scotland, and sir gareth smote him down horse and  man.  and in the same wise he served king uriens of the  land of gore.  and then there came in sir bagdemagus,  and sir gareth smote him down horse and man to the  earth.  and bagdemagus’s son meliganus brake a spear  upon sir gareth mightily and knightly.  and then sir  galahault the noble prince cried on high, knight with  the many colors, well hast thou justed; now make thee  ready that i may just with thee.  sir gareth heard him,  and he gat a great spear, and so they encountered  together, and there the prince brake his spear; but sir  gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm, that  he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not  his men recovered him.  truly, said king arthur, that  knight with the many colors is a good knight.  wherefore  the king called unto him sir launcelot, and prayed him  to encounter with that knight.  sir, said launcelot, i  may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at  this time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and  when a good knight doth so well upon some day, it is  no good knight’s part to let him of his worship, and,  namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great  labour; for peradventure, said sir launcelot, his  quarrel is here this day, and peradventure he is best  beloved with this lady of all that be here, for i see  well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great  deeds, and therefore, said sir launcelot, as for me,  this day he shall have the honour; though it lay in my  power to put him from it, i would not.', 'there was an unpleasant little episode that day, which for reasonsof state i struck out of my priest’s report.  you will have noticedthat garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement.  wheni say garry i mean sir gareth.  garry was my private pet namefor him; it suggests that i had a deep affection for him, and thatwas the case.  but it was a private pet name only, and never spokenaloud to any one, much less to him; being a noble, he would nothave endured a familiarity like that from me.  well, to proceed:i sat in the private box set apart for me as the king’s minister.while sir dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists,he came in there and sat down and began to talk; for he was alwaysmaking up to me, because i was a stranger and he liked to havea fresh market for his jokes, the most of them having reached thatstage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself whilethe other person looks sick.  i had always responded to his effortsas well as i could, and felt a very deep and real kindness for him,too, for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the oneparticular anecdote which i had heard oftenest and had most hatedand most loathed all my life, he had at least spared it me.  it wasone which i had heard attributed to every humorous person whohad ever stood on american soil, from columbus down to artemus ward.it was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audiencewith the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh; andthen when he was leaving, some gray simpletons wrung him gratefullyby the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had everheard, and “it was all they could do to keep from laughin’ rightout in meetin’.”  that anecdote never saw the day that it wasworth the telling; and yet i had sat under the telling of ithundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times, andcried and cursed all the way through.  then who can hope to knowwhat my feelings were, to hear this armor-plated ass start in onit again, in the murky twilight of tradition, before the dawn ofhistory, while even lactantius might be referred to as “the latelactantius,” and the crusades wouldn’t be born for five hundredyears yet?  just as he finished, the call-boy came; so, haw-hawinglike a demon, he went rattling and clanking out like a crate ofloose castings, and i knew nothing more.  it was some minutesbefore i came to, and then i opened my eyes just in time to seesir gareth fetch him an awful welt, and i unconsciously out withthe prayer, “i hope to gracious he’s killed!”  but by ill-luck,before i had got half through with the words, sir gareth crashedinto sir sagramor le desirous and sent him thundering over hishorse’s crupper, and sir sagramor caught my remark and thoughti meant it for _him_.', 'well, whenever one of those people got a thing into his head,there was no getting it out again.  i knew that, so i saved mybreath, and offered no explanations.  as soon as sir sagramorgot well, he notified me that there was a little account to settlebetween us, and he named a day three or four years in the future;place of settlement, the lists where the offense had been given.i said i would be ready when he got back.  you see, he was goingfor the holy grail.  the boys all took a flier at the holy grailnow and then.  it was a several years’ cruise.  they always put inthe long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way,though none of them had any idea where the holy grail really was,and i don’t think any of them actually expected to find it, orwould have known what to do with it if he _had_ run across it.you see, it was just the northwest passage of that day, as you maysay; that was all.  every year expeditions went out holy grailing,and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for _them_.  therewas worlds of reputation in it, but no money.  why, they actuallywanted _me_ to put in!  well, i should smile.', '', 'chapter x', 'beginnings of civilization', 'the round table soon heard of the challenge, and of course it wasa good deal discussed, for such things interested the boys.the king thought i ought now to set forth in quest of adventures,so that i might gain renown and be the more worthy to meetsir sagramor when the several years should have rolled away.i excused myself for the present; i said it would take me threeor four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly;then i should be ready; all the chances were that at the end ofthat time sir sagramor would still be out grailing, so no valuabletime would be lost by the postponement; i should then have beenin office six or seven years, and i believed my system and machinerywould be so well developed that i could take a holiday withoutits working any harm.', 'i was pretty well satisfied with what i had already accomplished.in various quiet nooks and corners i had the beginnings of allsorts of industries under way--nuclei of future vast factories,the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization.  in thesewere gathered together the brightest young minds i could find,and i kept agents out raking the country for more, all the time.i was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts--expertsin every sort of handiwork and scientific calling.  these nurseriesof mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in theirobscure country retreats, for nobody was allowed to come into theirprecincts without a special permit--for i was afraid of the church.', 'i had started a teacher-factory and a lot of sunday-schools thefirst thing; as a result, i now had an admirable system of gradedschools in full blast in those places, and also a complete varietyof protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growingcondition.  everybody could be any kind of a christian he wantedto; there was perfect freedom in that matter.  but i confined publicreligious teaching to the churches and the sunday-schools, permittingnothing of it in my other educational buildings.  i could havegiven my own sect the preference and made everybody a presbyterianwithout any trouble, but that would have been to affront a lawof human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as various inthe human family as are physical appetites, complexions, andfeatures, and a man is only at his best, morally, when he isequipped with the religious garment whose color and shape andsize most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion,angularities, and stature of the individual who wears it;

lastly they hung my shieldaround my neck, and i was all complete and ready to up anchorand get to sea.  everybody was as good to me as they could be,and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup-cup her own self.  there wasnothing more to do now, but for that damsel to get up behind me ona pillion, which she did, and put an arm or so around me to hold on.', 'and so we started, and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved theirhandkerchiefs or helmets.  and everybody we met, going down the hilland through the village was respectful to us, except some shabbylittle boys on the outskirts.  they said:', '“oh, what a guy!”  and hove clods at us.', 'in my experience boys are the same in all ages.  they don’t respectanything, they don’t care for anything or anybody.  they say“go up, baldhead” to the prophet going his unoffending way inthe gray of antiquity;

and beyondthe valleys we saw the ranges of hills, blue with haze, stretchingaway in billowy perspective to the horizon, with at wide intervalsa dim fleck of white or gray on a wave-summit, which we knew wasa castle.  we crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew,and we moved like spirits, the cushioned turf giving out no soundof footfall; we dreamed along through glades in a mist of greenlight that got its tint from the sun-drenched roof of leavesoverhead, and by our feet the clearest and coldest of runletswent frisking and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort ofwhispering music, comfortable to hear; and at times we left theworld behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and richgloom of the forest, where furtive wild things whisked and scurriedby and were gone before you could even get your eye on the placewhere the noise was; and where only the earliest birds were turningout and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonderand a mysterious far-off hammering and drumming for worms ona tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable remotenesses ofthe woods.  and by and by out we would swing again into the glare.', 'about the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out intothe glare--it was along there somewhere, a couple of hours or soafter sun-up--it wasn’t as pleasant as it had been.  it wasbeginning to get hot.  this was quite noticeable.  we had a verylong pull, after that, without any shade.  now it is curious howprogressively little frets grow and multiply after they once geta start.  things which i didn’t mind at all, at first, i beganto mind now--and more and more, too, all the time.  the firstten or fifteen times i wanted my handkerchief i didn’t seem to care;i got along, and said never mind, it isn’t any matter, and droppedit out of my mind.  but now it was different; i wanted it allthe time; it was nag, nag, nag, right along, and no rest; i couldn’tget it out of my mind; and so at last i lost my temper and saidhang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pocketsin it.  you see i had my handkerchief in my helmet; and some otherthings; but it was that kind of a helmet that you can’t take offby yourself.  that hadn’t occurred to me when i put it there;and in fact i didn’t know it.  i supposed it would be particularlyconvenient there.  and so now, the thought of its being there,so handy and close by, and yet not get-at-able, made it all theworse and the harder to bear.  yes, the thing that you can’t getis the thing that you want, mainly; every one has noticed that.well, it took my mind off from everything else; took it clear off,and centered it in my helmet; and mile after mile, there it stayed,imagining the handkerchief, picturing the handkerchief; and itwas bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep tricklingdown into my eyes, and i couldn’t get at it.  it seems like a littlething, on paper, but it was not a little thing at all; it wasthe most real kind of misery.  i would not say it if it was not so.i made up my mind that i would carry along a reticule next time,let it look how it might, and people say what they would.  of coursethese iron dudes of the round table would think it was scandalous,and maybe raise sheol about it, but as for me, give me comfortfirst, and style afterwards.  so we jogged along, and now and thenwe struck a stretch of dust, and it would tumble up in clouds andget into my nose and make me sneeze and cry; and of course i saidthings i oughtn’t to have said, i don’t deny that.  i am notbetter than others.', 'we couldn’t seem to meet anybody in this lonesome britain, noteven an ogre; and, in the mood i was in then, it was well forthe ogre; that is, an ogre with a handkerchief.  most knightswould have thought of nothing but getting his armor; but so i gothis bandanna, he could keep his hardware, for all of me.', 'meantime, it was getting hotter and hotter in there.  you see,the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and moreall the time.  well, when you are hot, that way, every little thingirritates you.  when i trotted, i rattled like a crate of dishes,and that annoyed me; and moreover i couldn’t seem to stand thatshield slatting and banging, now about my breast, now around myback; and if i dropped into a walk my joints creaked and screechedin that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does, and as we didn’tcreate any breeze at that gait, i was like to get fried in thatstove; and besides, the quieter you went the heavier the ironsettled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weighevery minute.  and you had to be always changing hands, and passingyour spear over to the other foot, it got so irksome for one handto hold it long at a time.', 'well, you know, when you perspire that way, in rivers, there comesa time when you--when you--well, when you itch.  you are inside,your hands are outside;

and i could only shake my head, whichwas baking hot by this time, and the fly--well, you know how a flyacts when he has got a certainty--he only minded the shaking enoughto change from nose to lip, and lip to ear, and buzz and buzzall around in there, and keep on lighting and biting, in a waythat a person, already so distressed as i was, simply could notstand.  so i gave in, and got alisande to unship the helmet andrelieve me of it.  then she emptied the conveniences out of itand fetched it full of water, and i drank and then stood up, andshe poured the rest down inside the armor. one cannot think howrefreshing it was.  she continued to fetch and pour until i waswell soaked and thoroughly comfortable.', 'it was good to have a rest--and peace.  but nothing is quiteperfect in this life, at any time.  i had made a pipe a while back,and also some pretty fair tobacco;

not enough for me, anyway.  we had to wait untilsomebody should come along.  waiting, in silence, would have beenagreeable enough, for i was full of matter for reflection, andwanted to give it a chance to work.  i wanted to try and think outhow it was that rational or even half-rational men could everhave learned to wear armor, considering its inconveniences; andhow they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generationswhen it was plain that what i had suffered to-day they had hadto suffer all the days of their lives.  i wanted to think that out;and moreover i wanted to think out some way to reform this eviland persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out;

yetalready i was getting dissatisfied; partly because i could notlight my pipe--for, although i had long ago started a match factory,i had forgotten to bring matches with me--and partly because wehad nothing to eat.  here was another illustration of the childlikeimprovidence of this age and people.  a man in armor always trustedto chance for his food on a journey, and would have been scandalizedat the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear.  therewas probably not a knight of all the round table combination whowould not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thingas that on his flagstaff.  and yet there could not be anything moresensible.  it had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwichesinto my helmet, but i was interrupted in the act, and had to makean excuse and lay them aside, and a dog got them.', 'night approached, and with it a storm.  the darkness came on fast.we must camp, of course.  i found a good shelter for the demoiselleunder a rock, and went off and found another for myself.  buti was obliged to remain in my armor, because i could not get it offby myself and yet could not allow alisande to help, because itwould have seemed so like undressing before folk.  it would nothave amounted to that in reality, because i had clothes onunderneath;

and the stronger the windblew, and the wilder the rain lashed around, the colder and colderit got.  pretty soon, various kinds of bugs and ants and wormsand things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down insidemy armor to get warm; and while some of them behaved well enough,and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet, the majoritywere of a restless, uncomfortable sort, and never stayed still,but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what;especially the ants, which went tickling along in wearisomeprocession from one end of me to the other by the hour, and area kind of creatures which i never wish to sleep with again.it would be my advice to persons situated in this way, to not rollor thrash around, because this excites the interest of all thedifferent sorts of animals and makes every last one of them wantto turn out and see what is going on, and this makes things worsethan they were before, and of course makes you objurgate harder,too, if you can.  still, if one did not roll and thrash aroundhe would die; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other;there is no real choice.  even after i was frozen solid i couldstill distinguish that tickling, just as a corpse does when he istaking electric treatment.  i said i would never wear armorafter this trip.', 'all those trying hours whilst i was frozen and yet was in a livingfire, as you may say, on account of that swarm of crawlers, thatsame unanswerable question kept circling and circling through mytired head: how do people stand this miserable armor?  how havethey managed to stand it all these generations?  how can they sleepat night for dreading the tortures of next day?', 'when the morning came at last, i was in a bad enough plight: seedy,drowsy, fagged, from want of sleep; weary from thrashing around,famished from long fasting; pining for a bath, and to get rid ofthe animals; and crippled with rheumatism.  and how had it faredwith the nobly born, the titled aristocrat, the demoiselle alisandela carteloise?  why, she was as fresh as a squirrel; she had sleptlike the dead; and as for a bath, probably neither she nor anyother noble in the land had ever had one, and so she was notmissing it.  measured by modern standards, they were merely modifiedsavages, those people.  this noble lady showed no impatience to getto breakfast--and that smacks of the savage, too.  on their journeysthose britons were used to long fasts, and knew how to bear them;and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting,after the style of the indian and the anaconda.  as like as not,sandy was loaded for a three-day stretch.', 'we were off before sunrise, sandy riding and i limping alongbehind.  in half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poorcreatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regardedas a road.  they were as humble as animals to me; and when iproposed to breakfast with them, they were so flattered, sooverwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine thatat first they were not able to believe that i was in earnest.my lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side; she saidin their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with theother cattle--a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merelybecause it referred to them, and not because it insulted or offendedthem, for it didn’t.  and yet they were not slaves, not chattels.by a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen.  seven-tenthsof the free population of the country were of just their class anddegree: small “independent” farmers, artisans, etc.; which isto say, they were the nation, the actual nation; they were aboutall of it that was useful, or worth saving, or really respect-worthy,and to subtract them would have been to subtract the nation andleave behind some dregs, some refuse, in the shape of a king,nobility and gentry, idle, unproductive, acquainted mainly withthe arts of wasting and destroying, and of no sort of use or valuein any rationally constructed world.  and yet, by ingeniouscontrivance, this gilded minority, instead of being in the tailof the procession where it belonged, was marching head up andbanners flying, at the other end of it; had elected itself to bethe nation, and these innumerable clams had permitted it so longthat they had come at last to accept it as a truth; and not onlythat, but to believe it right and as it should be.  the priestshad told their fathers and themselves that this ironical stateof things was ordained of god; and so, not reflecting upon howunlike god it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms, and especiallysuch poor transparent ones as this, they had dropped the matterthere and become respectfully quiet.', 'the talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound ina formerly american ear.  they were freemen, but they could notleave the estates of their lord or their bishop without hispermission; they could not prepare their own bread, but must havetheir corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his bakery,and pay roundly for the same; they could not sell a piece of theirown property without paying him a handsome percentage of theproceeds, nor buy a piece of somebody else’s without rememberinghim in cash for the privilege; they had to harvest his grain for himgratis, and be ready to come at a moment’s notice, leaving theirown crop to destruction by the threatened storm; they had to lethim plant fruit trees in their fields, and then keep their indignationto themselves when his heedless fruit-gatherers trampled the grainaround the trees; they had to smother their anger when his huntingparties galloped through their fields laying waste the result oftheir patient toil; they were not allowed to keep doves themselves,and when the swarms from my lord’s dovecote settled on their cropsthey must not lose their temper and kill a bird, for awful wouldthe penalty be; when the harvest was at last gathered, then camethe procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it: firstthe church carted off its fat tenth, then the king’s commissionertook his twentieth, then my lord’s people made a mighty inroadupon the remainder; after which, the skinned freeman had libertyto bestow the remnant in his barn, in case it was worth the trouble;there were taxes, and taxes, and taxes, and more taxes, and taxesagain, and yet other taxes--upon this free and independent pauper,but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop, none upon thewasteful nobility or the all-devouring church; if the baron wouldsleep unvexed, the freeman must sit up all night after his day’swork and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet; if the freeman’sdaughter--but no, that last infamy of monarchical government isunprintable; and finally, if the freeman, grown desperate with histortures, found his life unendurable under such conditions, andsacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge, the gentlechurch condemned him to eternal fire, the gentle law buried himat midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through his back,and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his propertyand turned his widow and his orphans out of doors.', 'and here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to workon their lord the bishop’s road three days each--gratis; everyhead of a family, and every son of a family, three days each,gratis, and a day or so added for their servants.  why, it waslike reading about france and the french, before the ever memorableand blessed revolution, which swept a thousand years of suchvillany away in one swift tidal-wave of blood--one: a settlementof that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood foreach hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out ofthat people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong andshame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell.there were two “reigns of terror,” if we would but remember itand consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the otherin heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other hadlasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousandpersons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders areall for the “horrors” of the minor terror, the momentary terror,so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe,compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty,and heart-break?  what is swift death by lightning compared withdeath by slow fire at the stake?  a city cemetery could contain thecoffins filled by that brief terror which we have all been sodiligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all france couldhardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real terror--that unspeakably bitter and awful terror which none of us hasbeen taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves.', 'these poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfastand their talk with me, were as full of humble reverence for theirking and church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire.there was something pitifully ludicrous about it.  i asked themif they supposed a nation of people ever existed, who, with a freevote in every man’s hand, would elect that a single family and itsdescendants should reign over it forever, whether gifted or boobies,to the exclusion of all other families--including the voter’s; andwould also elect that a certain hundred families should be raisedto dizzy summits of rank, and clothed on with offensive transmissibleglories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the nation’sfamilies--_including his own_.', 'they all looked unhit, and said they didn’t know; that they hadnever thought about it before, and it hadn’t ever occurred to themthat a nation could be so situated that every man _could_ havea say in the government.  i said i had seen one--and that it wouldlast until it had an established church.  again they were allunhit--at first.  but presently one man looked up and asked meto state that proposition again; and state it slowly, so it couldsoak into his understanding.  i did it; and after a little he hadthe idea, and he brought his fist down and said _he_ didn’t believea nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get downin the mud and dirt in any such way; and that to steal from a nationits will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes.i said to myself:', '“this one’s a man.  if i were backed by enough of his sort, i wouldmake a strike for the welfare of this country, and try to provemyself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in itssystem of government.”', 'you see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one’s country, not toits institutions or its office-holders.  the country is the realthing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thingto watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions areextraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out,become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the bodyfrom winter, disease, and death.  to be loyal to rags, to shoutfor rags, to worship rags, to die for rags--that is a loyaltyof unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy, was inventedby monarchy; let monarchy keep it.  i was from connecticut, whoseconstitution declares “that all political power is inherent inthe people, and all free governments are founded on their authorityand instituted for their benefit; and that they have _at all times_an undeniable and indefeasible right to _alter their form ofgovernment_ in such a manner as they may think expedient.”', 'under that gospel, the citizen who thinks he sees that thecommonwealth’s political clothes are worn out, and yet holds hispeace and does not agitate for a new suit, is disloyal; he isa traitor.  that he may be the only one who thinks he sees thisdecay, does not excuse him; it is his duty to agitate anyway, andit is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not seethe matter as he does.', 'and now here i was, in a country where a right to say how thecountry should be governed was restricted to six persons in eachthousand of its population.  for the nine hundred and ninety-fourto express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and proposeto change it, would have made the whole six shudder as one man,it would have been so disloyal, so dishonorable, such putrid blacktreason.  so to speak, i was become a stockholder in a corporationwhere nine hundred and ninety-four of the members furnished allthe money and did all the work, and the other six elected themselvesa permanent board of direction and took all the dividends.  it seemedto me that what the nine hundred and ninety-four dupes needed wasa new deal.  the thing that would have best suited the circus sideof my nature would have been to resign the boss-ship and get upan insurrection and turn it into a revolution; but i knew that thejack cade or the wat tyler who tries such a thing without firsteducating his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutelycertain to get left.  i had never been accustomed to getting left,even if i do say it myself.  wherefore, the “deal” which had beenfor some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite differentpattern from the cade-tyler sort.', 'so i did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who satmunching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of humansheep, but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him.after i had finished, i got him to lend me a little ink from hisveins;

and straightway there was bustleamong them and tightening of saddle-girths for the mount.  my pipewas ready and would have been lit, if i had not been lost inthinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restoreto all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliginganybody.  i lit up at once, and by the time i had got a good headof reserved steam on, here they came.  all together, too; none ofthose chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much about--one courtly rascal at a time, and the rest standing by to see fairplay.  no, they came in a body, they came with a whirr and a rush,they came like a volley from a battery; came with heads low down,plumes streaming out behind, lances advanced at a level.  it wasa handsome sight, a beautiful sight--for a man up a tree.  i laidmy lance in rest and waited, with my heart beating, till the ironwave was just ready to break over me, then spouted a column ofwhite smoke through the bars of my helmet.  you should have seenthe wave go to pieces and scatter!  this was a finer sight thanthe other one.', 'but these people stopped, two or three hundred yards away, andthis troubled me.  my satisfaction collapsed, and fear came;i judged i was a lost man.  but sandy was radiant; and was goingto be eloquent--but i stopped her, and told her my magic hadmiscarried, somehow or other, and she must mount, with all despatch,and we must ride for life.  no, she wouldn’t.  she said that myenchantment had disabled those knights;

below the salt sat minor officers of the household, withtheir principal subordinates: altogether a hundred and eighteenpersons sitting, and about as many liveried servants standingbehind their chairs, or serving in one capacity or another.  it wasa very fine show.  in a gallery a band with cymbals, horns, harps,and other horrors, opened the proceedings with what seemed to bethe crude first-draft or original agony of the wail known to latercenturies as “in the sweet bye and bye.”  it was new, and oughtto have been rehearsed a little more.  for some reason or otherthe queen had the composer hanged, after dinner.', 'after this music, the priest who stood behind the royal table saida noble long grace in ostensible latin.  then the battalion ofwaiters broke away from their posts, and darted, rushed, flew,fetched and carried, and the mighty feeding began;

his features were contorted andset, and sweat-drops stood upon his forehead.  a priest bent overhim on each side; the executioner stood by; guards were on duty;smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls;

the whip conveyed hisdesire without that.  none of these poor creatures looked up aswe rode along by; they showed no consciousness of our presence.and they made no sound but one; that was the dull and awful clankof their chains from end to end of the long file, as forty-threeburdened feet rose and fell in unison.  the file moved in a cloudof its own making.', 'all these faces were gray with a coating of dust.  one has seenthe like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses, andhas written his idle thought in it with his finger.  i was remindedof this when i noticed the faces of some of those women, youngmothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom, howa something in their hearts was written in the dust upon theirfaces, plain to see, and lord, how plain to read! for it was thetrack of tears.  one of these young mothers was but a girl, andit hurt me to the heart to read that writing, and reflect that itwas come up out of the breast of such a child, a breast that oughtnot to know trouble yet, but only the gladness of the morning oflife;

and then helaid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed, sheshrieking and struggling the while piteously.  one of the men whowas holding her turned away his face, and for this humanity he wasreviled and flogged.', 'all our pilgrims looked on and commented--on the expert way inwhich the whip was handled.  they were too much hardened by lifelongeveryday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anythingelse in the exhibition that invited comment.  this was what slaverycould do, in the way of ossifying what one may call the superiorlobe of human feeling;

i could havetold it myself, with one hand tied behind me.  the well was in adark chamber which stood in the center of a cut-stone chapel, whosewalls were hung with pious pictures of a workmanship that wouldhave made a chromo feel good; pictures historically commemorativeof curative miracles which had been achieved by the waters whennobody was looking.  that is, nobody but angels; they are alwayson deck when there is a miracle to the fore--so as to get put inthe picture, perhaps.  angels are as fond of that as a fire company;look at the old masters.', 'the well-chamber was dimly lighted by lamps; the water was drawnwith a windlass and chain by monks, and poured into troughs whichdelivered it into stone reservoirs outside in the chapel--whenthere was water to draw, i mean--and none but monks could enterthe well-chamber.  i entered it, for i had temporary authorityto do so, by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate.but he hadn’t entered it himself.  he did everything by incantations;he never worked his intellect.  if he had stepped in there and usedhis eyes, instead of his disordered mind, he could have curedthe well by natural means, and then turned it into a miracle inthe customary way; but no, he was an old numskull, a magician whobelieved in his own magic; and no magician can thrive who ishandicapped with a superstition like that.', 'i had an idea that the well had sprung a leak; that some of thewall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures thatallowed the water to escape.  i measured the chain--98 feet.  theni called in a couple of monks, locked the door, took a candle, andmade them lower me in the bucket.  when the chain was all paid out,the candle confirmed my suspicion; a considerable section of thewall was gone, exposing a good big fissure.', 'i almost regretted that my theory about the well’s trouble wascorrect, because i had another one that had a showy point or twoabout it for a miracle.  i remembered that in america, manycenturies later, when an oil well ceased to flow, they used toblast it out with a dynamite torpedo.  if i should find this welldry and no explanation of it, i could astonish these people mostnobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamitebomb into it.  it was my idea to appoint merlin.  however, it wasplain that there was no occasion for the bomb.  one cannot haveeverything the way he would like it.  a man has no business tobe depressed by a disappointment, anyway; he ought to make up hismind to get even.  that is what i did.  i said to myself, i am in nohurry, i can wait; that bomb will come good yet.  and it did, too.', 'when i was above ground again, i turned out the monks, and let downa fish-line; the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep, and therewas forty-one feet of water in it.  i called in a monk and asked:', '“how deep is the well?”', '“that, sir, i wit not, having never been told.”', '“how does the water usually stand in it?”', '“near to the top, these two centuries, as the testimony goeth,brought down to us through our predecessors.”', 'it was true--as to recent times at least--for there was witnessto it, and better witness than a monk; only about twenty or thirtyfeet of the chain showed wear and use, the rest of it was unwornand rusty.  what had happened when the well gave out that othertime?  without doubt some practical person had come along andmended the leak, and then had come up and told the abbot he haddiscovered by divination that if the sinful bath were destroyedthe well would flow again.  the leak had befallen again now, andthese children would have prayed, and processioned, and tolledtheir bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blewaway, and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to dropa fish-line into the well or go down in it and find out what wasreally the matter.  old habit of mind is one of the toughest thingsto get away from in the world.  it transmits itself like physicalform and feature;

we boredinto a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of thewell-chamber and inserted a section of lead pipe that was longenough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyondthe threshold, where the gushing water would be visible to thetwo hundred and fifty acres of people i was intending should bepresent on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock atthe proper time.', 'we knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted thishogshead to the flat roof of the chapel, where we clamped it downfast, poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on thebottom, then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as theycould loosely stand, all the different breeds of rockets there are;and they made a portly and imposing sheaf, i can tell you.  wegrounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder,we placed a whole magazine of greek fire on each corner of theroof--blue on one corner, green on another, red on another, andpurple on the last--and grounded a wire in each.', 'about two hundred yards off, in the flat, we built a pen ofscantlings, about four feet high, and laid planks on it, and somade a platform.  we covered it with swell tapestries borrowedfor the occasion, and topped it off with the abbot’s own throne.when you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race, you wantto get in every detail that will count;

but it pays in the end.  well, we brought the wires tothe ground at the chapel, and then brought them under the groundto the platform, and hid the batteries there.  we put a rope fencea hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the commonmultitude, and that finished the work.  my idea was, doors openat 10:30, performance to begin at 11:25 sharp.  i wished i couldcharge admission, but of course that wouldn’t answer.  i instructedmy boys to be in the chapel as early as 10, before anybody wasaround, and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time, andmake the fur fly.  then we went home to supper.', 'the news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time;and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people hadbeen pouring into the valley.  the lower end of the valley wasbecome one huge camp;

in fact, add as manyofficers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in thecountry, even if there should finally be five times as many officersas privates in it; and thus make it the crack regiment, the enviedregiment, the king’s own regiment, and entitled to fight on itsown hook and in its own way, and go whither it would and comewhen it pleased, in time of war, and be utterly swell and independent.this would make that regiment the heart’s desire of all thenobility, and they would all be satisfied and happy.  then wewould make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplacematerials, and officer it with nobodies, as was proper--nobodiesselected on a basis of mere efficiency--and we would make thisregiment toe the line, allow it no aristocratic freedom fromrestraint, and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering,to the end that whenever the king’s own was tired and wanted to gooff for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a goodtime, it could go without uneasiness, knowing that matters were insafe hands behind it, and business going to be continued at theold stand, same as usual.  the king was charmed with the idea.', 'when i noticed that, it gave me a valuable notion.  i thoughti saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last.  yousee, the royalties of the pendragon stock were a long-lived raceand very fruitful.  whenever a child was born to any of these--and it was pretty often--there was wild joy in the nation’s mouth,and piteous sorrow in the nation’s heart.  the joy was questionable,but the grief was honest.  because the event meant another callfor a royal grant.  long was the list of these royalties, andthey were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasuryand a menace to the crown.  yet arthur could not believe thislatter fact, and he would not listen to any of my various projectsfor substituting something in the place of the royal grants.  if icould have persuaded him to now and then provide a support forone of these outlying scions from his own pocket, i could havemade a grand to-do over it, and it would have had a good effectwith the nation; but no, he wouldn’t hear of such a thing.  he hadsomething like a religious passion for royal grant; he seemed tolook upon it as a sort of sacred swag, and one could not irritatehim in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon thatvenerable institution.  if i ventured to cautiously hint that therewas not another respectable family in england that would humbleitself to hold out the hat--however, that is as far as i ever got;he always cut me short there, and peremptorily, too.', 'but i believed i saw my chance at last.  i would form this crackregiment out of officers alone--not a single private.  half of itshould consist of nobles, who should fill all the places up tomajor-general, and serve gratis and pay their own expenses; andthey would be glad to do this when they should learn that the restof the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood.these princes of the blood should range in rank from lieutenant-generalup to field marshal, and be gorgeously salaried and equipped andfed by the state.  moreover--and this was the master stroke--it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be alwaysaddressed by a stunningly gaudy and awe-compelling title (whichi would presently invent), and they and they only in all englandshould be so addressed.  finally, all princes of the blood shouldhave free choice; join that regiment, get that great title, andrenounce the royal grant, or stay out and receive a grant.  neatesttouch of all: unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be_born_ into the regiment, and start fair, with good wages and apermanent situation, upon due notice from the parents.', 'all the boys would join, i was sure of that;

abouthim were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals.conspicuous, both for location and personal outfit, stood marinel,a hermit of the quack-doctor species, to introduce the sick.  allabroad over the spacious floor, and clear down to the doors,in a thick jumble, lay or sat the scrofulous, under a strong light.it was as good as a tableau; in fact, it had all the look of beinggotten up for that, though it wasn’t.  there were eight hundredsick people present.  the work was slow; it lacked the interestof novelty for me, because i had seen the ceremonies before;the thing soon became tedious, but the proprieties required meto stick it out.  the doctor was there for the reason that in allsuch crowds there were many people who only imagined somethingwas the matter with them, and many who were consciously soundbut wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king, andyet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece ofcoin that went with the touch.  up to this time this coin had beena wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar.  when youconsider how much that amount of money would buy, in that ageand country, and how usual it was to be scrofulous, when not dead,you would understand that the annual king’s-evil appropriation wasjust the river and harbor bill of that government for the grip ittook on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning thesurplus.  so i had privately concluded to touch the treasury itselffor the king’s-evil.  i covered six-sevenths of the appropriationinto the treasury a week before starting from camelot on myadventures, and ordered that the other seventh be inflated intofive-cent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerkof the king’s evil department; a nickel to take the place of eachgold coin, you see, and do its work for it.  it might strain thenickel some, but i judged it could stand it.  as a rule, i do notapprove of watering stock, but i considered it square enoughin this case, for it was just a gift, anyway.  of course, you canwater a gift as much as you want to; and i generally do.  the oldgold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknownorigin, as a rule, but some of them were roman; they were ill-shapen,and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full; theywere hammered, not minted, and they were so worn with use thatthe devices upon them were as illegible as blisters, and lookedlike them.  i judged that a sharp, bright new nickel, with afirst-rate likeness of the king on one side of it and gueneveron the other, and a blooming pious motto, would take the tuck outof scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulousfancy more; and i was right.  this batch was the first it wastried on, and it worked to a charm.  the saving in expense wasa notable economy.  you will see that by these figures: we toucheda trifle over 700 of the 800 patients; at former rates, this wouldhave cost the government about $240; at the new rate we pulledthrough for about $35, thus saving upward of $200 at one swoop.to appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke, consider theseother figures: the annual expenses of a national government amountto the equivalent of a contribution of three days’ average wages ofevery individual of the population, counting every individual asif he were a man.  if you take a nation of 60,000,000, where averagewages are $2 per day, three days’ wages taken from each individualwill provide $360,000,000 and pay the government’s expenses.  in myday, in my own country, this money was collected from imposts,and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it, and itmade him comfortable to think so; whereas, in fact, it was paidby the american people, and was so equally and exactly distributedamong them that the annual cost to the 100-millionaire and theannual cost to the sucking child of the day-laborer was preciselythe same--each paid $6.  nothing could be equaler than that,i reckon.  well, scotland and ireland were tributary to arthur,and the united populations of the british islands amounted tosomething less than 1,000,000.  a mechanic’s average wage was3 cents a day, when he paid his own keep.  by this rule the nationalgovernment’s expenses were $90,000 a year, or about $250 a day.thus, by the substitution of nickels for gold on a king’s-evilday, i not only injured no one, dissatisfied no one, but pleasedall concerned and saved four-fifths of that day’s national expenseinto the bargain--a saving which would have been the equivalentof $800,000 in my day in america.  in making this substitutioni had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source--the wisdomof my boyhood--for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom,howsoever lowly may be its origin: in my boyhood i had alwayssaved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionarycause.  the buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well asthe coin, the coin would answer me better than the buttons; allhands were happy and nobody hurt.', 'marinel took the patients as they came.  he examined the candidate;if he couldn’t qualify he was warned off; if he could he was passedalong to the king.  a priest pronounced the words, “they shalllay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”  then the kingstroked the ulcers, while the reading continued; finally, thepatient graduated and got his nickel--the king hanging it aroundhis neck himself--and was dismissed.  would you think that thatwould cure?  it certainly did.  any mummery will cure if thepatient’s faith is strong in it.  up by astolat there was a chapelwhere the virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herdgeese around there--the girl said so herself--and they built thechapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing theoccurrence--a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sickperson to approach; whereas, on the contrary, thousands of the lameand the sick came and prayed before it every year and went awaywhole and sound; and even the well could look upon it and live.of course, when i was told these things i did not believe them;but when i went there and saw them i had to succumb.  i saw thecures effected myself;

and it was as easy aspersuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killingitself.  we walked along, silent and thinking.  finally the king said:', '“when ye know that i meditate a thing inconvenient, or that hatha peril in it, why do you not warn me to cease from that project?”', 'it was a startling question, and a puzzler.  i didn’t quite knowhow to take hold of it, or what to say, and so, of course, i endedby saying the natural thing:', '“but, sire, how can i know what your thoughts are?”', 'the king stopped dead in his tracks, and stared at me.', '“i believed thou wert greater than merlin; and truly in magicthou art.  but prophecy is greater than magic.  merlin is a prophet.”', 'i saw i had made a blunder.  i must get back my lost ground.after a deep reflection and careful planning, i said:', '“sire, i have been misunderstood.  i will explain.  there are twokinds of prophecy.  one is the gift to foretell things that are buta little way off, the other is the gift to foretell things thatare whole ages and centuries away.  which is the mightier gift,do you think?”', '“oh, the last, most surely!”', '“true.  does merlin possess it?”', '“partly, yes.  he foretold mysteries about my birth and futurekingship that were twenty years away.”', '“has he ever gone beyond that?”', '“he would not claim more, i think.”', '“it is probably his limit.  all prophets have their limit.  the limitof some of the great prophets has been a hundred years.”', '“these are few, i ween.”', '“there have been two still greater ones, whose limit was fourhundred and six hundred years, and one whose limit compassedeven seven hundred and twenty.”', '“gramercy, it is marvelous!”', '“but what are these in comparison with me?  they are nothing.”', '“what?  canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretchof time as--”', '“seven hundred years?  my liege, as clear as the vision of an eagledoes my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of thisworld for nearly thirteen centuries and a half!”', 'my land, you should have seen the king’s eyes spread slowly open,and lift the earth’s entire atmosphere as much as an inch!  thatsettled brer merlin.  one never had any occasion to prove hisfacts, with these people; all he had to do was to state them.  itnever occurred to anybody to doubt the statement.', '“now, then,” i continued, “i _could_ work both kinds of prophecy--the long and the short--if i chose to take the trouble to keepin practice; but i seldom exercise any but the long kind, becausethe other is beneath my dignity.  it is properer to merlin’s sort--stump-tail prophets, as we call them in the profession.  of course,i whet up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy, but notoften--hardly ever, in fact.  you will remember that there wasgreat talk, when you reached the valley of holiness, about myhaving prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival,two or three days beforehand.”', '“indeed, yes, i mind it now.”', '“well, i could have done it as much as forty times easier, andpiled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain, if it hadbeen five hundred years away instead of two or three days.”', '“how amazing that it should be so!”', '“yes, a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is fivehundred years away easier than he can a thing that’s only fivehundred seconds off.”', '“and yet in reason it should clearly be the other way; it shouldbe five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first,for, indeed, it is so close by that one uninspired might almostsee it.  in truth, the law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods,most strangely making the difficult easy, and the easy difficult.”', 'it was a wise head.  a peasant’s cap was no safe disguise for it;you could know it for a king’s under a diving-bell, if you couldhear it work its intellect.', 'i had a new trade now, and plenty of business in it.  the kingwas as hungry to find out everything that was going to happenduring the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to livein them.  from that time out, i prophesied myself bald-headedtrying to supply the demand.  i have done some indiscreet things inmy day, but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was theworst.  still, it had its ameliorations.  a prophet doesn’t haveto have any brains.  they are good to have, of course, for theordinary exigencies of life, but they are no use in professionalwork.  it is the restfulest vocation there is.  when the spirit ofprophecy comes upon you, you merely take your intellect and lay itoff in a cool place for a rest, and unship your jaw and leave italone; it will work itself: the result is prophecy.', 'every day a knight-errant or so came along, and the sight of themfired the king’s martial spirit every time.  he would have forgottenhimself, sure, and said something to them in a style a suspiciousshade or so above his ostensible degree, and so i always got himwell out of the road in time.  then he would stand and look withall his eyes; and a proud light would flash from them, and hisnostrils would inflate like a war-horse’s, and i knew he waslonging for a brush with them.  but about noon of the third dayi had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had beensuggested by the whip-stroke that had fallen to my share two daysbefore; a precaution which i had afterward decided to leave untaken,i was so loath to institute it; but now i had just had a freshreminder: while striding heedlessly along, with jaw spread andintellect at rest, for i was prophesying, i stubbed my toe andfell sprawling.  i was so pale i couldn’t think for a moment;then i got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack.i had that dynamite bomb in it, done up in wool in a box.  it wasa good thing to have along; the time would come when i could doa valuable miracle with it, maybe, but it was a nervous thingto have about me, and i didn’t like to ask the king to carry it.yet i must either throw it away or think up some safe way to getalong with its society.  i got it out and slipped it into my scrip,and just then here came a couple of knights.  the king stood,stately as a statue, gazing toward them--had forgotten himself again,of course--and before i could get a word of warning out, it wastime for him to skip, and well that he did it, too.  he supposedthey would turn aside.  turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirtunder foot?  when had he ever turned aside himself--or ever hadthe chance to do it, if a peasant saw him or any other noble knightin time to judiciously save him the trouble?  the knights paidno attention to the king at all; it was his place to look outhimself, and if he hadn’t skipped he would have been placidlyridden down, and laughed at besides.', 'the king was in a flaming fury, and launched out his challengeand epithets with a most royal vigor.  the knights were some littledistance by now.  they halted, greatly surprised, and turned intheir saddles and looked back, as if wondering if it might be worthwhile to bother with such scum as we.  then they wheeled andstarted for us.  not a moment must be lost.  i started for _them_.i passed them at a rattling gait, and as i went by i flung out ahair-lifting soul-scorching thirteen-jointed insult which madethe king’s effort poor and cheap by comparison.  i got it out ofthe nineteenth century where they know how.  they had such headwaythat they were nearly to the king before they could check up;then, frantic with rage, they stood up their horses on their hindhoofs and whirled them around, and the next moment here they came,breast to breast.  i was seventy yards off, then, and scrambling upa great bowlder at the roadside.  when they were within thirtyyards of me they let their long lances droop to a level, depressedtheir mailed heads, and so, with their horse-hair plumes streamingstraight out behind, most gallant to see, this lightning expresscame tearing for me!  when they were within fifteen yards, i sentthat bomb with a sure aim, and it struck the ground just underthe horses’ noses.', 'yes, it was a neat thing, very neat and pretty to see.  it resembleda steamboat explosion on the mississippi; and during the nextfifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopicfragments of knights and hardware and horse-flesh.  i say we,for the king joined the audience, of course, as soon as he had gothis breath again.  there was a hole there which would afford steadywork for all the people in that region for some years to come--in trying to explain it, i mean; as for filling it up, that servicewould be comparatively prompt, and would fall to the lot of aselect few--peasants of that seignory; and they wouldn’t getanything for it, either.', 'but i explained it to the king myself. i said it was done with adynamite bomb.  this information did him no damage, because itleft him as intelligent as he was before.  however, it was a noblemiracle, in his eyes, and was another settler for merlin.  i thoughtit well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sortthat it couldn’t be done except when the atmospheric conditionswere just right.  otherwise he would be encoring it every time wehad a good subject, and that would be inconvenient, because ihadn’t any more bombs along.', '', 'chapter xxviii', 'drilling the king', 'on the morning of the fourth day, when it was just sunrise, and wehad been tramping an hour in the chill dawn, i came to a resolution:the king _must_ be drilled;

when his bell rang to call us tohis fields to harvest his crop for nothing, he would not allow thati and my two girls should count for our three captive sons, butfor only two of them; so, for the lacking one were we daily fined.all this time our own crop was perishing through neglect;

and if you pointed out that they did nothinder the decrees in the least, but only modified the hardconsequences of them if you took out policies and had luck, theyretorted that that was gambling against the decrees of god, and wasjust as bad.  so they managed to damage those industries moreor less, but i got even on my accident business.  as a rule, a knightis a lummux, and some times even a labrick, and hence open to prettypoor arguments when they come glibly from a superstition-monger,but even _he_ could see the practical side of a thing once in a while;and so of late you couldn’t clean up a tournament and pile theresult without finding one of my accident-tickets in every helmet.', 'we stood there awhile, in the thick darkness and stillness, lookingtoward the red blur in the distance, and trying to make out themeaning of a far-away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on thenight.  sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed lessremote; but when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its causeand nature, it dulled and sank again, carrying its mystery with it.we started down the hill in its direction, and the winding roadplunged us at once into almost solid darkness--darkness that waspacked and crammed in between two tall forest walls.  we gropedalong down for half a mile, perhaps, that murmur growing more andmore distinct all the time.  the coming storm threatening more andmore, with now and then a little shiver of wind, a faint show oflightning, and dull grumblings of distant thunder.  i was in thelead.  i ran against something--a soft heavy something which gave,slightly, to the impulse of my weight; at the same moment thelightning glared out, and within a foot of my face was the writhingface of a man who was hanging from the limb of a tree!  that is,it seemed to be writhing, but it was not.  it was a grewsome sight.straightway there was an ear-splitting explosion of thunder, andthe bottom of heaven fell out; the rain poured down in a deluge.no matter, we must try to cut this man down, on the chance thatthere might be life in him yet, mustn’t we?  the lightning camequick and sharp now, and the place was alternately noonday andmidnight.  one moment the man would be hanging before me in anintense light, and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness.i told the king we must cut him down.  the king at once objected.', '“if he hanged himself, he was willing to lose him property tohis lord;

a roar of men’s voices.  a man came flyingby now, dimly through the darkness, and other men chasing him.they disappeared.  presently another case of the kind occurred,and then another and another.  then a sudden turn of the roadbrought us in sight of that fire--it was a large manor-house, andlittle or nothing was left of it--and everywhere men were flyingand other men raging after them in pursuit.', 'i warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers.we would better get away from the light, until matters shouldimprove.  we stepped back a little, and hid in the edge of thewood.  from this hiding-place we saw both men and women huntedby the mob.  the fearful work went on until nearly dawn.  then,the fire being out and the storm spent, the voices and flyingfootsteps presently ceased, and darkness and stillness reigned again.', 'we ventured out, and hurried cautiously away; and although we wereworn out and sleepy, we kept on until we had put this place somemiles behind us.  then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoalburner, and got what was to be had.  a woman was up and about, butthe man was still asleep, on a straw shake-down, on the clay floor.the woman seemed uneasy until i explained that we were travelersand had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night.she became talkative, then, and asked if we had heard of theterrible goings-on at the manor-house of abblasoure.  yes, we hadheard of them, but what we wanted now was rest and sleep.  theking broke in:', '“sell us the house and take yourselves away, for we be perilouscompany, being late come from people that died of the spotted death.”', 'it was good of him, but unnecessary.  one of the commonest decorationsof the nation was the waffle-iron face.  i had early noticed thatthe woman and her husband were both so decorated.  she made usentirely welcome, and had no fears; and plainly she was immenselyimpressed by the king’s proposition; for, of course, it was a gooddeal of an event in her life to run across a person of the king’shumble appearance who was ready to buy a man’s house for the sakeof a night’s lodging.  it gave her a large respect for us, and shestrained the lean possibilities of her hovel to the utmost to makeus comfortable.', 'we slept till far into the afternoon, and then got up hungry enough tomake cotter fare quite palatable to the king, the more particularlyas it was scant in quantity.  and also in variety; it consistedsolely of onions, salt, and the national black bread made out ofhorse-feed.  the woman told us about the affair of the eveningbefore.  at ten or eleven at night, when everybody was in bed,the manor-house burst into flames.  the country-side swarmed tothe rescue, and the family were saved, with one exception, themaster.  he did not appear.  everybody was frantic over this loss,and two brave yeomen sacrificed their lives in ransacking theburning house seeking that valuable personage.  but after a whilehe was found--what was left of him--which was his corpse.  it wasin a copse three hundred yards away, bound, gagged, stabbed in adozen places.', 'who had done this?  suspicion fell upon a humble family in theneighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshnessby the baron;

then a sudden somethingelse betrayed itself in their faces, and they began to ask questions.i answered the questions myself, and narrowly watched the effectsproduced.  i was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who thesethree prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere; thatour hosts’ continued eagerness to go and spread the news was nowonly pretended and not real.  the king did not notice the change,and i was glad of that.  i worked the conversation around towardother details of the night’s proceedings, and noted that thesepeople were relieved to have it take that direction.', 'the painful thing observable about all this business was thealacrity with which this oppressed community had turned theircruel hands against their own class in the interest of the commonoppressor.  this man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrelbetween a person of their own class and his lord, it was the naturaland proper and rightful thing for that poor devil’s whole casteto side with the master and fight his battle for him, without everstopping to inquire into the rights or wrongs of the matter.  thisman had been out helping to hang his neighbors, and had done hiswork with zeal, and yet was aware that there was nothing againstthem but a mere suspicion, with nothing back of it describableas evidence, still neither he nor his wife seemed to see anythinghorrible about it.', 'this was depressing--to a man with the dream of a republic in hishead.  it reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away, whenthe “poor whites” of our south who were always despised andfrequently insulted by the slave-lords around them, and who owedtheir base condition simply to the presence of slavery in theirmidst, were yet pusillanimously ready to side with the slave-lordsin all political moves for the upholding and perpetuating ofslavery, and did also finally shoulder their muskets and pour outtheir lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that veryinstitution which degraded them.  and there was only one redeemingfeature connected with that pitiful piece of history; and that was,that secretly the “poor white” did detest the slave-lord, and didfeel his own shame.  that feeling was not brought to the surface,but the fact that it was there and could have been brought out,under favoring circumstances, was something--in fact, it was enough;for it showed that a man is at bottom a man, after all, even if itdoesn’t show on the outside.', 'well, as it turned out, this charcoal burner was just the twin ofthe southern “poor white” of the far future.  the king presentlyshowed impatience, and said:', '“an ye prattle here all the day, justice will miscarry.  think yethe criminals will abide in their father’s house?  they are fleeing,they are not waiting.  you should look to it that a party of horsebe set upon their track.”', 'the woman paled slightly, but quite perceptibly, and the man lookedflustered and irresolute.  i said:', '“come, friend, i will walk a little way with you, and explain whichdirection i think they would try to take.  if they were merelyresisters of the gabelle or some kindred absurdity i would tryto protect them from capture;

to the gentlemanhe was abject; with the small farmer and the free mechanic he wascordial and gossipy; and when a slave passed by with a countenancerespectfully lowered, this chap’s nose was in the air--he couldn’teven see him.  well, there are times when one would like to hangthe whole human race and finish the farce.', 'presently we struck an incident.  a small mob of half-naked boysand girls came tearing out of the woods, scared and shrieking.the eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen yearsold.  they implored help, but they were so beside themselves thatwe couldn’t make out what the matter was.  however, we plungedinto the wood, they skurrying in the lead, and the trouble wasquickly revealed: they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope,and he was kicking and struggling, in the process of choking todeath.  we rescued him, and fetched him around.  it was some morehuman nature; the admiring little folk imitating their elders;they were playing mob, and had achieved a success which promisedto be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for.', 'it was not a dull excursion for me.  i managed to put in the timevery well.  i made various acquaintanceships, and in my qualityof stranger was able to ask as many questions as i wanted to.a thing which naturally interested me, as a statesman, was thematter of wages.  i picked up what i could under that head duringthe afternoon.  a man who hasn’t had much experience, and doesn’tthink, is apt to measure a nation’s prosperity or lack of prosperityby the mere size of the prevailing wages; if the wages be high, thenation is prosperous; if low, it isn’t.  which is an error.  itisn’t what sum you get, it’s how much you can buy with it, that’sthe important thing; and it’s that that tells whether your wagesare high in fact or only high in name.  i could remember how itwas in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century.in the north a carpenter got three dollars a day, gold valuation;in the south he got fifty--payable in confederate shinplastersworth a dollar a bushel.  in the north a suit of overalls costthree dollars--a day’s wages; in the south it cost seventy-five--which was two days’ wages.  other things were in proportion.consequently, wages were twice as high in the north as they werein the south, because the one wage had that much more purchasingpower than the other had.', 'yes, i made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing thatgratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation--lots of milrays, lots of mills, lots of cents, a good many nickels,and some silver; all this among the artisans and commonaltygenerally; yes, and even some gold--but that was at the bank,that is to say, the goldsmith’s.  i dropped in there while marco,the son of marco, was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarterof a pound of salt, and asked for change for a twenty-dollar goldpiece.  they furnished it--that is, after they had chewed the piece,and rung it on the counter, and tried acid on it, and asked mewhere i got it, and who i was, and where i was from, and wherei was going to, and when i expected to get there, and perhapsa couple of hundred more questions; and when they got aground,i went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily;told them i owned a dog, and his name was watch, and my first wifewas a free will baptist, and her grandfather was a prohibitionist,and i used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a warton the inside of his upper lip, and died in the hope of a gloriousresurrection, and so on, and so on, and so on, till even thathungry village questioner began to look satisfied, and also a shadeput out; but he had to respect a man of my financial strength,and so he didn’t give me any lip, but i noticed he took it out ofhis underlings, which was a perfectly natural thing to do.  yes,they changed my twenty, but i judged it strained the bank a little,which was a thing to be expected, for it was the same as walkinginto a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiringthe boss of it to change a two thousand-dollar bill for you allof a sudden.  he could do it, maybe; but at the same time hewould wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so muchmoney around in his pocket; which was probably this goldsmith’sthought, too; for he followed me to the door and stood there gazingafter me with reverent admiration.', 'our new money was not only handsomely circulating, but its languagewas already glibly in use; that is to say, people had droppedthe names of the former moneys, and spoke of things as being worthso many dollars or cents or mills or milrays now.  it was verygratifying.  we were progressing, that was sure.', 'i got to know several master mechanics, but about the most interestingfellow among them was the blacksmith, dowley.  he was a live manand a brisk talker, and had two journeymen and three apprentices,and was doing a raging business.  in fact, he was getting rich,hand over fist, and was vastly respected.  marco was very proud ofhaving such a man for a friend.  he had taken me there ostensiblyto let me see the big establishment which bought so much of hischarcoal, but really to let me see what easy and almost familiarterms he was on with this great man.  dowley and i fraternizedat once; i had had just such picked men, splendid fellows, underme in the colt arms factory.  i was bound to see more of him, soi invited him to come out to marco’s sunday, and dine with us.marco was appalled, and held his breath; and when the grandeeaccepted, he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonishedat the condescension.', 'marco’s joy was exuberant--but only for a moment; then he grewthoughtful, then sad; and when he heard me tell dowley i shouldhave dickon, the boss mason, and smug, the boss wheelwright, outthere, too, the coal-dust on his face turned to chalk, and he losthis grip.  but i knew what was the matter with him; it was theexpense.  he saw ruin before him; he judged that his financialdays were numbered.  however, on our way to invite the others,i said:', '“you must allow me to have these friends come; and you must alsoallow me to pay the costs.”', 'his face cleared, and he said with spirit:', '“but not all of it, not all of it.  ye cannot well bear a burdenlike to this alone.”', 'i stopped him, and said:', '“now let’s understand each other on the spot, old friend.  i amonly a farm bailiff, it is true;

so i said:', '“and marco, there’s another thing which you must permit--out ofkindness for jones--because you wouldn’t want to offend him.he was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way, buthe is so diffident he couldn’t venture it himself, and so he beggedme to buy some little things and give them to you and dame phyllisand let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came fromhim--you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing--and so i said i would, and we would keep mum.  well, his ideawas, a new outfit of clothes for you both--”', '“oh, it is wastefulness!  it may not be, brother, it may not be.consider the vastness of the sum--”', '“hang the vastness of the sum!  try to keep quiet for a moment,and see how it would seem; a body can’t get in a word edgeways,you talk so much.  you ought to cure that, marco; it isn’t goodform, you know, and it will grow on you if you don’t check it.yes, we’ll step in here now and price this man’s stuff--and don’tforget to remember to not let on to jones that you know he hadanything to do with it.  you can’t think how curiously sensitiveand proud he is.  he’s a farmer--pretty fairly well-to-do farmer--and i’m his bailiff; _but_--the imagination of that man!  why,sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off, you’dthink he was one of the swells of the earth; and you might listento him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer--especially ifhe talked agriculture.  he _thinks_ he’s a sheol of a farmer; thinkshe’s old grayback from wayback; but between you and me privatelyhe don’t know as much about farming as he does about runninga kingdom--still, whatever he talks about, you want to drop yourunderjaw and listen, the same as if you had never heard suchincredible wisdom in all your life before, and were afraid youmight die before you got enough of it.  that will please jones.”', 'it tickled marco to the marrow to hear about such an odd character;but it also prepared him for accidents;

it’s got to be theatrical or i don’ttake any interest in it.  i showed up money enough, in a carelessway, to corral the shopkeeper’s respect, and then i wrote downa list of the things i wanted, and handed it to him to see if hecould read it.  he could, and was proud to show that he could.he said he had been educated by a priest, and could both readand write.  he ran it through, and remarked with satisfaction thatit was a pretty heavy bill.  well, and so it was, for a littleconcern like that.  i was not only providing a swell dinner, butsome odds and ends of extras.  i ordered that the things be cartedout and delivered at the dwelling of marco, the son of marco,by saturday evening, and send me the bill at dinner-time sunday.he said i could depend upon his promptness and exactitude, it wasthe rule of the house.  he also observed that he would throw ina couple of miller-guns for the marcos gratis--that everybodywas using them now.  he had a mighty opinion of that cleverdevice.  i said:', '“and please fill them up to the middle mark, too;

also a sizeabledeal dinner-table; also two entire pounds of salt, which wasanother piece of extravagance in those people’s eyes; also crockery,stools, the clothes, a small cask of beer, and so on.  i instructedthe marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness, so as to giveme a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little.  concerningthe new clothes, the simple couple were like children; they were upand down, all night, to see if it wasn’t nearly daylight, so thatthey could put them on, and they were into them at last as muchas an hour before dawn was due.  then their pleasure--not to saydelirium--was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of itpaid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered.the king had slept just as usual--like the dead.  the marcos couldnot thank him for their clothes, that being forbidden;

and very handy, too; you could pay out money in the darkwith it, with accuracy; and you could carry it in your mouth; orin your vest pocket, if you had one.  i made them of several sizes--one size so large that it would carry the equivalent of a dollar.using shot for money was a good thing for the government;

nowwe began to hear those sounds more plainly; so the mob had struckour trail.  for a while the sounds approached pretty fast.  andthen for another while they didn’t.  no doubt the dogs had foundthe place where we had entered the stream, and were now waltzingup and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again.', 'when we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage,the king was satisfied, but i was doubtful.  i believed we couldcrawl along a branch and get into the next tree, and i judged itworth while to try.  we tried it, and made a success of it, thoughthe king slipped, at the junction, and came near failing to connect.we got comfortable lodgment and satisfactory concealment amongthe foliage, and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt.', 'presently we heard it coming--and coming on the jump, too;

almost laugh.', 'but we didn’t; which was just as well, for we should have beeninterrupted.  before the stones had been raging through the leavesand bouncing from the boughs fifteen minutes, we began to noticea smell.  a couple of sniffs of it was enough of an explanation--it was smoke!  our game was up at last.  we recognized that.  whensmoke invites you, you have to come.  they raised their pile ofdry brush and damp weeds higher and higher, and when they sawthe thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree, they brokeout in a storm of joy-clamors.  i got enough breath to say:', '“proceed, my liege;

and some few purchaseshad been added to the gang.  the king was not interested, andwanted to move along, but i was absorbed, and full of pity.  i couldnot take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity.there they sat, grounded upon the ground, silent, uncomplaining,with bowed heads, a pathetic sight.  and by hideous contrast, aredundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirtysteps away, in fulsome laudation of “our glorious british liberties!”', 'i was boiling.  i had forgotten i was a plebeian, i was rememberingi was a man.  cost what it might, i would mount that rostrum and--', 'click! the king and i were handcuffed together!  our companions,those servants, had done it;

by words, not by effects.  they take a _meaning_, and getto be very vivid, when you come to apply them to yourself.', 'all hands shook their heads and looked disappointed; some turnedaway, no longer interested.  the orator said--and this time in thetones of business, not of sentiment:', '“an ye do not know your country’s laws, it were time ye learnedthem.  ye are strangers to us; ye will not deny that. ye may befreemen, we do not deny that; but also ye may be slaves.  the lawis clear: it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves,it requireth you to prove ye are not.”', 'i said:', '“dear sir, give us only time to send to astolat;

it could not help us any to give these peoplethe notion that we were lunatics.', 'there is no use in stringing out the details.  the earl put us upand sold us at auction.  this same infernal law had existed inour own south in my own time, more than thirteen hundred yearslater, and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove thatthey were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery withoutthe circumstance making any particular impression upon me; but theminute law and the auction block came into my personal experience,a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenlyhellish.  well, that’s the way we are made.', 'yes, we were sold at auction, like swine.  in a big town and anactive market we should have brought a good price;

this was natural.what would he brood about, should you say?  why, about the prodigiousnature of his fall, of course--from the loftiest place in the worldto the lowest; from the most illustrious station in the world tothe obscurest; from the grandest vocation among men to the basest.no, i take my oath that the thing that graveled him most, to startwith, was not this, but the price he had fetched!  he couldn’tseem to get over that seven dollars.  well, it stunned me so, wheni first found it out, that i couldn’t believe it; it didn’t seemnatural.  but as soon as my mental sight cleared and i got a rightfocus on it, i saw i was mistaken; it _was_ natural.  for thisreason: a king is a mere artificiality, and so a king’s feelings,like the impulses of an automatic doll, are mere artificialities;but as a man, he is a reality, and his feelings, as a man, arereal, not phantoms.  it shames the average man to be valued belowhis own estimate of his worth, and the king certainly wasn’tanything more than an average man, if he was up that high.', 'confound him, he wearied me with arguments to show that in anythinglike a fair market he would have fetched twenty-five dollars,sure--a thing which was plainly nonsense, and full or the baldestconceit; i wasn’t worth it myself.  but it was tender ground forme to argue on.  in fact, i had to simply shirk argument and dothe diplomatic instead.  i had to throw conscience aside, andbrazenly concede that he ought to have brought twenty-five dollars;whereas i was quite well aware that in all the ages, the world hadnever seen a king that was worth half the money, and during thenext thirteen centuries wouldn’t see one that was worth the fourthof it.  yes, he tired me.  if he began to talk about the crops;or about the recent weather; or about the condition of politics;or about dogs, or cats, or morals, or theology--no matter what--i sighed, for i knew what was coming; he was going to get out of ita palliation of that tiresome seven-dollar sale.  wherever wehalted where there was a crowd, he would give me a look whichsaid plainly: “if that thing could be tried over again now, withthis kind of folk, you would see a different result.”  well, whenhe was first sold, it secretly tickled me to see him go for sevendollars; but before he was done with his sweating and worryingi wished he had fetched a hundred.  the thing never got a chanceto die, for every day, at one place or another, possible purchaserslooked us over, and, as often as any other way, their comment onthe king was something like this:', '“here’s a two-dollar-and-a-half chump with a thirty-dollar style.pity but style was marketable.”', 'at last this sort of remark produced an evil result.  our ownerwas a practical person and he perceived that this defect must bemended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king.  so he wentto work to take the style out of his sacred majesty.  i could havegiven the man some valuable advice, but i didn’t; you mustn’tvolunteer advice to a slave-driver unless you want to damagethe cause you are arguing for.  i had found it a sufficientlydifficult job to reduce the king’s style to a peasant’s style,even when he was a willing and anxious pupil; now then, to undertaketo reduce the king’s style to a slave’s style--and by force--go to!it was a stately contract.  never mind the details--it will save metrouble to let you imagine them.  i will only remark that at theend of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and cluband fist had done their work well; the king’s body was a sightto see--and to weep over; but his spirit?--why, it wasn’t evenphased.  even that dull clod of a slave-driver was able to seethat there can be such a thing as a slave who will remain a mantill he dies; whose bones you can break, but whose manhood youcan’t.  this man found that from his first effort down to hislatest, he couldn’t ever come within reach of the king, but theking was ready to plunge for him, and did it.  so he gave upat last, and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired.the fact is, the king was a good deal more than a king, he wasa man; and when a man is a man, you can’t knock it out of him.', 'we had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the earth,and suffering.  and what englishman was the most interested inthe slavery question by that time?  his grace the king!  yes; frombeing the most indifferent, he was become the most interested.he was become the bitterest hater of the institution i had everheard talk.  and so i ventured to ask once more a question whichi had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer thati had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further.would he abolish slavery?', 'his answer was as sharp as before, but it was music this time;i shouldn’t ever wish to hear pleasanter, though the profanitywas not good, being awkwardly put together, and with the crash-wordalmost in the middle instead of at the end, where, of course, itought to have been.', 'i was ready and willing to get free now; i hadn’t wanted to getfree any sooner.  no, i cannot quite say that.  i had wanted to,but i had not been willing to take desperate chances, and hadalways dissuaded the king from them.  but now--ah, it was a newatmosphere!  liberty would be worth any cost that might be putupon it now.  i set about a plan, and was straightway charmedwith it.  it would require time, yes, and patience, too, a greatdeal of both.  one could invent quicker ways, and fully as sureones; but none that would be as picturesque as this; none thatcould be made so dramatic.  and so i was not going to give thisone up.  it might delay us months, but no matter, i would carryit out or break something.', 'now and then we had an adventure.  one night we were overtakenby a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were makingfor.  almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog, the drivingsnow was so thick.  you couldn’t see a thing, and we were soonlost.  the slave-driver lashed us desperately, for he saw ruinbefore him, but his lashings only made matters worse, for theydrove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor.so we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where wewere.  the storm continued until toward midnight, then ceased.by this time two of our feebler men and three of our women weredead, and others past moving and threatened with death.  ourmaster was nearly beside himself.  he stirred up the living, andmade us stand, jump, slap ourselves, to restore our circulation,and he helped as well as he could with his whip.', 'now came a diversion.  we heard shrieks and yells, and soon awoman came running and crying;

theybrought wood and piled it about her; they applied the torch whileshe shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughtersto her breast; and our brute, with a heart solely for business,lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into lifeand commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocentlife of that poor harmless mother.  that was the sort of master wehad.  i took _his_ number.  that snow-storm cost him nine of hisflock;

and mainly mud and thatch.  the streetswere muddy, crooked, unpaved.  the populace was an ever flockingand drifting swarm of rags, and splendors, of nodding plumes andshining armor.  the king had a palace there; he saw the outsideof it.  it made him sigh; yes, and swear a little, in a poorjuvenile sixth century way.  we saw knights and grandees whomwe knew, but they didn’t know us in our rags and dirt and rawwelts and bruises, and wouldn’t have recognized us if we had hailedthem, nor stopped to answer, either, it being unlawful to speakwith slaves on a chain.  sandy passed within ten yards of me ona mule--hunting for me, i imagined.  but the thing which cleanbroke my heart was something which happened in front of our oldbarrack in a square, while we were enduring the spectacle of a manbeing boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies.  it wasthe sight of a newsboy--and i couldn’t get at him!  still, i hadone comfort--here was proof that clarence was still alive andbanging away.  i meant to be with him before long;

no such thing ever happened to fallin my way.  however, my chance came at last.  a gentleman whohad come twice before to dicker for me, without result, or indeedany approach to a result, came again.  i was far from expectingever to belong to him, for the price asked for me from the timei was first enslaved was exorbitant, and always provoked eitheranger or derision, yet my master stuck stubbornly to it--twenty-twodollars.  he wouldn’t bate a cent.  the king was greatly admired,because of his grand physique, but his kingly style was againsthim, and he wasn’t salable; nobody wanted that kind of a slave.i considered myself safe from parting from him because of myextravagant price.  no, i was not expecting to ever belong tothis gentleman whom i have spoken of, but he had something whichi expected would belong to me eventually, if he would but visitus often enough.  it was a steel thing with a long pin to it, withwhich his long cloth outside garment was fastened together infront.  there were three of them. he had disappointed me twice,because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my projectentirely safe;

so i made several prematureattempts, and merely delayed things by it; for i couldn’t seemto touch a padlock, there in the dark, without starting a rattleout of it which interrupted somebody’s sleep and made him turnover and wake some more of the gang.', 'but finally i did get my last iron off, and was a free man oncemore.  i took a good breath of relief, and reached for the king’sirons.  too late! in comes the master, with a light in one handand his heavy walking-staff in the other.  i snuggled close amongthe wallow of snorers, to conceal as nearly as possible that i wasnaked of irons;

it wasnot because the second (official) personage in the kingdom wasone of the duellists; no, all these features were commonplace.yet there was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest whichthis coming fight was creating.  it was born of the fact that allthe nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men,so to speak, but a duel between two mighty magicians; a duel notof muscle but of mind, not of human skill but of superhuman artand craft; a final struggle for supremacy between the two masterenchanters of the age.  it was realized that the most prodigiousachievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthyof comparison with a spectacle like this; they could be but child’splay, contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods.yes, all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duelbetween merlin and me, a measuring of his magic powers againstmine.  it was known that merlin had been busy whole days and nightstogether, imbuing sir sagramor’s arms and armor with supernalpowers of offense and defense, and that he had procured for himfrom the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render thewearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to othermen.  against sir sagramor, so weaponed and protected, a thousandknights could accomplish nothing; against him no known enchantmentscould prevail.  these facts were sure; regarding them there wasno doubt, no reason for doubt.  there was but one question: mightthere be still other enchantments, _unknown_ to merlin, which couldrender sir sagramor’s veil transparent to me, and make his enchantedmail vulnerable to my weapons?  this was the one thing to bedecided in the lists.  until then the world must remain in suspense.', 'so the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here, andthe world was right, but it was not the one they had in theirminds.  no, a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die:_the life of knight-errantry_.  i was a champion, it was true, butnot the champion of the frivolous black arts, i was the championof hard unsentimental common-sense and reason.  i was enteringthe lists to either destroy knight-errantry or be its victim.', 'vast as the show-grounds were, there were no vacant spaces in themoutside of the lists, at ten o’clock on the morning of the 16th.the mammoth grand-stand was clothed in flags, streamers, and richtapestries, and packed with several acres of small-fry tributarykings, their suites, and the british aristocracy; with our ownroyal gang in the chief place, and each and every individuala flashing prism of gaudy silks and velvets--well, i never sawanything to begin with it but a fight between an upper mississippisunset and the aurora borealis.  the huge camp of beflagged andgay-colored tents at one end of the lists, with a stiff-standingsentinel at every door and a shining shield hanging by him forchallenge, was another fine sight.  you see, every knight wasthere who had any ambition or any caste feeling; for my feelingtoward their order was not much of a secret, and so here was theirchance.  if i won my fight with sir sagramor, others would havethe right to call me out as long as i might be willing to respond.', 'down at our end there were but two tents; one for me, and anotherfor my servants.  at the appointed hour the king made a sign, andthe heralds, in their tabards, appeared and made proclamation,naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel.  therewas a pause, then a ringing bugle-blast, which was the signal forus to come forth.  all the multitude caught their breath, andan eager curiosity flashed into every face.', 'out from his tent rode great sir sagramor, an imposing towerof iron, stately and rigid, his huge spear standing upright in itssocket and grasped in his strong hand, his grand horse’s face andbreast cased in steel, his body clothed in rich trappings thatalmost dragged the ground--oh, a most noble picture.  a greatshout went up, of welcome and admiration.', 'and then out i came.  but i didn’t get any shout.  there wasa wondering and eloquent silence for a moment, then a great waveof laughter began to sweep along that human sea, but a warningbugle-blast cut its career short.  i was in the simplest andcomfortablest of gymnast costumes--flesh-colored tights from neckto heel, with blue silk puffings about my loins, and bareheaded.my horse was not above medium size, but he was alert, slender-limbed,muscled with watchsprings, and just a greyhound to go.  he wasa beauty, glossy as silk, and naked as he was when he was born,except for bridle and ranger-saddle.', 'the iron tower and the gorgeous bedquilt came cumbrously butgracefully pirouetting down the lists, and we tripped lightly upto meet them.  we halted; the tower saluted, i responded; thenwe wheeled and rode side by side to the grand-stand and facedour king and queen, to whom we made obeisance.  the queen exclaimed:', '“alack, sir boss, wilt fight naked, and without lance or sword or--”', 'but the king checked her and made her understand, with a politephrase or two, that this was none of her business.  the buglesrang again; and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists,and took position.  now old merlin stepped into view and casta dainty web of gossamer threads over sir sagramor which turnedhim into hamlet’s ghost; the king made a sign, the bugles blew,sir sagramor laid his great lance in rest, and the next moment herehe came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind,and i went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him--cocking my ear the while, as if noting the invisible knight’sposition and progress by hearing, not sight.  a chorus of encouragingshouts burst out for him, and one brave voice flung out a hearteningword for me--said:', '“go it, slim jim!”', 'it was an even bet that clarence had procured that favor for me--and furnished the language, too.  when that formidable lance-pointwas within a yard and a half of my breast i twitched my horse asidewithout an effort, and the big knight swept by, scoring a blank.i got plenty of applause that time.  we turned, braced up, anddown we came again.  another blank for the knight, a roar ofapplause for me.  this same thing was repeated once more; andit fetched such a whirlwind of applause that sir sagramor lost histemper, and at once changed his tactics and set himself the taskof chasing me down.  why, he hadn’t any show in the world at that;it was a game of tag, with all the advantage on my side; i whirledout of his path with ease whenever i chose, and once i slapped himon the back as i went to the rear.  finally i took the chase intomy own hands; and after that, turn, or twist, or do what he would,he was never able to get behind me again; he found himself alwaysin front at the end of his maneuver.  so he gave up that businessand retired to his end of the lists.  his temper was clear gone now,and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposedof mine.  i slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle, andgrasped the coil in my right hand.  this time you should have seenhim come!--it was a business trip, sure; by his gait there wasblood in his eye.  i was sitting my horse at ease, and swingingthe great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head; themoment he was under way, i started for him; when the space betweenus had narrowed to forty feet, i sent the snaky spirals of the ropea-cleaving through the air, then darted aside and faced about andbrought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced underhim for a surge.  the next moment the rope sprang taut and yankedsir sagramor out of the saddle!  great scott, but there wasa sensation!', 'unquestionably, the popular thing in this world is novelty.  thesepeople had never seen anything of that cowboy business before,and it carried them clear off their feet with delight.  from allaround and everywhere, the shout went up:', '“encore! encore!”', 'i wondered where they got the word, but there was no time to cipheron philological matters, because the whole knight-errantry hivewas just humming now, and my prospect for trade couldn’t havebeen better.  the moment my lasso was released and sir sagramorhad been assisted to his tent, i hauled in the slack, took mystation and began to swing my loop around my head again.  i wassure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successorfor sir sagramor, and that couldn’t take long where there wereso many hungry candidates.  indeed, they elected one straight off--sir hervis de revel.', '_bzz_!  here he came, like a house afire; i dodged: he passed likea flash, with my horse-hair coils settling around his neck;a second or so later, _fst_! his saddle was empty.', 'i got another encore; and another, and another, and still another.when i had snaked five men out, things began to look serious tothe ironclads, and they stopped and consulted together.  as aresult, they decided that it was time to waive etiquette and sendtheir greatest and best against me.  to the astonishment of thatlittle world, i lassoed sir lamorak de galis, and after himsir galahad.  so you see there was simply nothing to be done now,but play their right bower--bring out the superbest of the superb,the mightiest of the mighty, the great sir launcelot himself!', 'a proud moment for me?  i should think so.  yonder was arthur,king of britain;

i couldn’t account forthis thing.  next, i noticed merlin gliding away from me; and theni noticed that my lasso was gone!  the old sleight-of-hand experthad stolen it, sure, and slipped it under his robe.', 'the bugle blew again.  i looked, and down came sagramor ridingagain, with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely re-arranged.i trotted up to meet him, and pretended to find him by the soundof his horse’s hoofs.  he said:', '“thou’rt quick of ear, but it will not save thee from this!” andhe touched the hilt of his great sword.  “an ye are not able to seeit, because of the influence of the veil, know that it is no cumbrouslance, but a sword--and i ween ye will not be able to avoid it.”', 'his visor was up;

their subjects would fillthe vacancies with catlings from our own royal house; we shouldbecome a factory; we should supply the thrones of the world; withinforty years all europe would be governed by cats, and we shouldfurnish the cats.  the reign of universal peace would begin then,to end no more forever....  me-e-e-yow-ow-ow-ow--fzt!--wow!”', 'hang him, i supposed he was in earnest, and was beginning to bepersuaded by him, until he exploded that cat-howl and startled mealmost out of my clothes.  but he never could be in earnest.  hedidn’t know what it was.  he had pictured a distinct and perfectlyrational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy,but he was too feather-headed to know it, or care anything aboutit, either.  i was going to give him a scolding, but sandy cameflying in at that moment, wild with terror, and so choked with sobsthat for a minute she could not get her voice.  i ran and took herin my arms, and lavished caresses upon her and said, beseechingly:', '“speak, darling, speak!  what is it?”', 'her head fell limp upon my bosom, and she gasped, almost inaudibly:', '“hello-central!”', '“quick!” i shouted to clarence;

i had seen enough.  i wentto the platform and signaled to turn the current on to the twoinner fences.  then i went into the cave, and found everythingsatisfactory there--nobody awake but the working-watch.  i wokeclarence and told him the great ditch was filling up with men,and that i believed all the knights were coming for us in a body.it was my notion that as soon as dawn approached we could expectthe ditch’s ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankmentand make an assault, and be followed immediately by the restof their army.', 'clarence said:', '“they will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to makepreliminary observations.  why not take the lightning off theouter fences, and give them a chance?”', '“i’ve already done it, clarence.  did you ever know me to beinhospitable?”', '“no, you are a good heart.  i want to go and--”', '“be a reception committee?  i will go, too.”', 'we crossed the corral and lay down together between the two insidefences.  even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesightsomewhat, but the focus straightway began to regulate itself andsoon it was adjusted for present circumstances.  we had had to feelour way before, but we could make out to see the fence posts now.we started a whispered conversation, but suddenly clarence brokeoff and said:', '“what is that?”', '“what is what?”', '“that thing yonder.”', '“what thing--where?”', '“there beyond you a little piece--dark something--a dull shapeof some kind--against the second fence.”', 'i gazed and he gazed.  i said:', '“could it be a man, clarence?”', '“no, i think not.  if you notice, it looks a lit--why, it _is_a man!--leaning on the fence.”', '“i certainly believe it is; let us go and see.”', 'we crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close,and then looked up.  yes, it was a man--a dim great figure in armor,standing erect, with both hands on the upper wire--and, of course,there was a smell of burning flesh.  poor fellow, dead as adoor-nail, and never knew what hurt him.  he stood there like astatue--no motion about him, except that his plumes swished abouta little in the night wind.  we rose up and looked in throughthe bars of his visor, but couldn’t make out whether we knew himor not--features too dim and shadowed.', 'we heard muffled sounds approaching, and we sank down to the groundwhere we were.  we made out another knight vaguely; he was comingvery stealthily, and feeling his way.  he was near enough now forus to see him put out a hand, find an upper wire, then bend andstep under it and over the lower one.  now he arrived at thefirst knight--and started slightly when he discovered him.  hestood a moment--no doubt wondering why the other one didn’t moveon; then he said, in a low voice, “why dreamest thou here, goodsir mar--” then he laid his hand on the corpse’s shoulder--and justuttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead.  killed by a deadman, you see--killed by a dead friend, in fact.  there was somethingawful about it.', 'these early birds came scattering along after each other, aboutone every five minutes in our vicinity, during half an hour.they brought no armor of offense but their swords; as a rule,they carried the sword ready in the hand, and put it forward andfound the wires with it.  we would now and then see a blue sparkwhen the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisibleto us; but we knew what had happened, all the same; poor fellow,he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been electrocuted.we had brief intervals of grim stillness, interrupted with piteousregularity by the clash made by the falling of an iron-clad; andthis sort of thing was going on, right along, and was very creepythere in the dark and lonesomeness.', 'we concluded to make a tour between the inner fences.  we electedto walk upright, for convenience’s sake; we argued that if discerned,we should be taken for friends rather than enemies, and in any casewe should be out of reach of swords, and these gentry did not seemto have any spears along.  well, it was a curious trip.  everywheredead men were lying outside the second fence--not plainly visible,but still visible; and we counted fifteen of those patheticstatues--dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire.', 'one thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated: our currentwas so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out.pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound, and next momentwe guessed what it was.  it was a surprise in force coming! i whisperedclarence to go and wake the army, and notify it to wait in silencein the cave for further orders.  he was soon back, and we stoodby the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awfulwork upon that swarming host.  one could make out but little ofdetail; but he could note that a black mass was piling itself upbeyond the second fence.  that swelling bulk was dead men!  ourcamp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead--a bulwark,a breastwork, of corpses, you may say.  one terrible thing aboutthis thing was the absence of human voices; there were no cheers,no war cries; being intent upon a surprise, these men moved asnoiselessly as they could; and always when the front rank was nearenough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to geta shout ready, of course they struck the fatal line and went downwithout testifying.', 'i sent a current through the third fence now; and almost immediatelythrough the fourth and fifth, so quickly were the gaps filled up.i believed the time was come now for my climax; i believed thatthat whole army was in our trap.  anyway, it was high time to findout.  so i touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflameon the top of our precipice.', 'land, what a sight!  we were enclosed in three walls of dead men!all the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living,who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires.the sudden glare paralyzed this host, petrified them, you may say,with astonishment; there was just one instant for me to utilizetheir immobility in, and i didn’t lose the chance.  you see, inanother instant they would have recovered their faculties, thenthey’d have burst into a cheer and made a rush, and my wireswould have gone down before it; but that lost instant lost themtheir opportunity forever; while even that slight fragment of timewas still unspent, i shot the current through all the fences andstruck the whole host dead in their tracks!  _there_ was a groanyou could _hear_!  it voiced the death-pang of eleven thousand men.it swelled out on the night with awful pathos.', 'a glance showed that the rest of the enemy--perhaps ten thousandstrong--were between us and the encircling ditch, and pressingforward to the assault.  consequently we had them _all!_ and hadthem past help.  time for the last act of the tragedy.  i firedthe three appointed revolver shots--which meant:', '“turn on the water!”', 'there was a sudden rush and roar, and in a minute the mountainbrook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river ahundred feet wide and twenty-five deep.', '“stand to your guns, men!  open fire!”', 'the thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated tenthousand.  they halted, they stood their ground a moment againstthat withering deluge of fire, then they broke, faced about andswept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale.  a full fourthpart of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment;the three-fourths reached it and plunged over--to death by drowning.', 'within ten short minutes after we had opened fire, armed resistancewas totally annihilated, the campaign was ended, we fifty-four weremasters of england.  twenty-five thousand men lay dead around us.', 'but how treacherous is fortune!  in a little while--say an hour--happened a thing, by my own fault, which--but i have no heartto write that.  let the record end here.', '', 'chapter xliv', 'a postscript by clarence', 'i, clarence, must write it for him.  he proposed that we twogo out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded.  i wasstrenuous against the project.  i said that if there were many,we could do but little for them; and it would not be wise for us totrust ourselves among them, anyway.  but he could seldom be turnedfrom a purpose once formed; so we shut off the electric currentfrom the fences, took an escort along, climbed over the enclosingramparts of dead knights, and moved out upon the field.  the firstwounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his backagainst a dead comrade.  when the boss bent over him and spoketo him, the man recognized him and stabbed him.  that knight wassir meliagraunce, as i found out by tearing off his helmet.  hewill not ask for help any more.', 'we carried the boss to the cave and gave his wound, which wasnot very serious, the best care we could.  in this service we hadthe help of merlin, though we did not know it.  he was disguisedas a woman, and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife.in this disguise, with brown-stained face and smooth shaven, hehad appeared a few days after the boss was hurt and offered to cookfor us, saying her people had gone off to join certain new campswhich the enemy were forming, and that she was starving.  the bosshad been getting along very well, and had amused himself withfinishing up his record.', 'we were glad to have this woman, for we were short handed.  wewere in a trap, you see--a trap of our own making.  if we stayedwhere we were, our dead would kill us; if we moved out of ourdefenses, we should no longer be invincible.  we had conquered;in turn we were conquered.  the boss recognized this; we allrecognized it.  if we could go to one of those new camps andpatch up some kind of terms with the enemy--yes, but the bosscould not go, and neither could i, for i was among the first thatwere made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands.others were taken down, and still others.  to-morrow--', '_to-morrow._  it is here.  and with it the end.  about midnighti awoke, and saw that hag making curious passes in the air aboutthe boss’s head and face, and wondered what it meant.  everybodybut the dynamo-watch lay steeped in sleep; there was no sound.the woman ceased from her mysterious foolery, and started tip-toeingtoward the door.  i called out:', '“stop!  what have you been doing?”', 'she halted, and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction:', '“ye were conquerors; ye are conquered!  these others are perishing--you also.  ye shall all die in this place--every one--except _him_.he sleepeth now--and shall sleep thirteen centuries.  i am merlin!”', 'then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeledabout like a drunken man, and presently fetched up against oneof our wires.  his mouth is spread open yet; apparently he is stilllaughing.  i suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh untilthe corpse turns to dust.', 'the boss has never stirred--sleeps like a stone.  if he does notwake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is, andhis body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recessesof the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it.  as forthe rest of us--well, it is agreed that if any one of us everescapes alive from this place, he will write the fact here, andloyally hide this manuscript with the boss, our dear good chief,whose property it is, be he alive or dead.']\n"
