a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court a word of explanation it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious stranger whom i am going to talk about he attracted me by three things his candid simplicity his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor and the restfulness of his company for he did all the talking we fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd that was being shown through and he at once began to say things which interested me as he talked along softly pleasantly flowingly he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world and time and into some remote era and old forgotten country and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that i seemed to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold of a gray antiquity holding speech with a relic of it exactly as i would speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies or my most familiar neighbors he spoke of sir bedivere sir bors de ganis sir launcelot of the lake sir galahad and all the other great names of the table round and how old old unspeakably old and faded and dry and musty and ancient he came to look as he went on presently he turned to me and said just as one might speak of the weather or any other common matter you know about transmigration of souls do you know about transposition of epochs and bodies i said i had not heard of it he was so little interested just as when people speak of the weather that he did not notice whether i made him any answer or not there was half a moment of silence immediately interrupted by the droning voice of the salaried cicerone ancient hauberk date of the sixth century time of king arthur and the round table said to have belonged to the knight sir sagramor le desirous observe the round hole through the chain mail in the left breast cant be accounted for supposed to have been done with a bullet since invention of firearms perhaps maliciously by cromwells soldiers my acquaintance smiled not a modern smile but one that must have gone out of general use many many centuries ago and muttered apparently to himself wit ye well i saw it done then after a pause added i did it myself by the time i had recovered from the electric surprise of this remark he was gone all that evening i sat by my fire at the warwick arms steeped in a dream of the olden time while the rain beat upon the windows and the wind roared about the eaves and corners from time to time i dipped into old sir thomas malorys enchanting book and fed at its rich feast of prodigies and adventures breathed in the fragrance of its obsolete names and dreamed again midnight being come at length i read another tale for a nightcap this which here follows to wit how sir launcelot slew two giants and made a castle free anon withal came there upon him two great giants well armed all save the heads with two horrible clubs in their hands sir launcelot put his shield afore him and put the stroke away of the one giant and with his sword he clave his head asunder when his fellow saw that he ran away as he were wood demented for fear of the horrible strokes and sir launcelot after him with all his might and smote him on the shoulder and clave him to the middle then sir launcelot went into the hall and there came afore him three score ladies and damsels and all kneeled unto him and thanked god and him of their deliverance for sir said they the most part of us have been here this seven year their prisoners and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat and we are all great gentle women born and blessed be the time knight that ever thou wert born for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in the world that will we bear record and we all pray you to tell us your name that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison fair damsels he said my name is sir launcelot du lake and so he departed from them and betaught them unto god and then he mounted upon his horse and rode into many strange and wild countries and through many waters and valleys and evil was he lodged and at the last by fortune him happened against a night to come to a fair courtilage and therein he found an old gentle woman that lodged him with a good will and there he had good cheer for him and his horse and when time was his host brought him into a fair garret over the gate to his bed there sir launcelot unarmed him and set his harness by him and went to bed and anon he fell on sleep so soon after there came one on horseback and knocked at the gate in great haste and when sir launcelot heard this he rose up and looked out at the window and saw by the moonlight three knights come riding after that one man and all three lashed on him at once with swords and that one knight turned on them knightly again and defended him truly said sir launcelot yonder one knight shall i help for it were shame for me to see three knights on one and if he be slain i am partner of his death and therewith he took his harness and went out at a window by a sheet down to the four knights and then sir launcelot said on high turn you knights unto me and leave your fighting with that knight and then they all three left sir kay and turned unto sir launcelot and there began great battle for they alight all three and strake many strokes at sir launcelot and assailed him on every side then sir kay dressed him for to have holpen sir launcelot nay sir said he i will none of your help therefore as ye will have my help let me alone with them sir kay for the pleasure of the knight suffered him for to do his will and so stood aside and then anon within six strokes sir launcelot had stricken them to the earth and then they all three cried sir knight we yield us unto you as man of might matchless as to that said sir launcelot i will not take your yielding unto me but so that ye yield you unto sir kay the seneschal on that covenant i will save your lives and else not fair knight said they that were we loath to do for as for sir kay we chased him hither and had overcome him had ye not been therefore to yield us unto him it were no reason well as to that said sir launcelot advise you well for ye may choose whether ye will die or live for an ye be yielden it shall be unto sir kay fair knight then they said in saving our lives we will do as thou commandest us then shall ye said sir launcelot on whitsunday next coming go unto the court of king arthur and there shall ye yield you unto queen guenever and put you all three in her grace and mercy and say that sir kay sent you thither to be her prisoners on the morn sir launcelot arose early and left sir kay sleeping and sir launcelot took sir kays armor and his shield and armed him and so he went to the stable and took his horse and took his leave of his host and so he departed then soon after arose sir kay and missed sir launcelot and then he espied that he had his armor and his horse now by my faith i know well that he will grieve some of the court of king arthur for on him knights will be bold and deem that it is i and that will beguile them and because of his armor and shield i am sure i shall ride in peace and then soon after departed sir kay and thanked his host as i laid the book down there was a knock at the door and my stranger came in i gave him a pipe and a chair and made him welcome i also comforted him with a hot scotch whisky gave him another one then still another hoping always for his story after a fourth persuader he drifted into it himself in a quite simple and natural way the strangers history i am an american i was born and reared in hartford in the state of connecticut anyway just over the river in the country so i am a yankee of the yankees and practical yes and nearly barren of sentiment i suppose or poetry in other words my father was a blacksmith my uncle was a horse doctor and i was both along at first then i went over to the great arms factory and learned my real trade learned all there was to it learned to make everything guns revolvers cannon boilers engines all sorts of labor saving machinery why i could make anything a body wanted anything in the world it didnt make any difference what and if there wasnt any quick new fangled way to make a thing i could invent one and do it as easy as rolling off a log i became head superintendent had a couple of thousand men under me well a man like that is a man that is full of fight that goes without saying with a couple of thousand rough men under one one has plenty of that sort of amusement i had anyway at last i met my match and i got my dose it was during a misunderstanding conducted with crowbars with a fellow we used to call hercules he laid me out with a crusher alongside the head that made everything crack and seemed to spring every joint in my skull and made it overlap its neighbor then the world went out in darkness and i didnt feel anything more and didnt know anything at all at least for a while when i came to again i was sitting under an oak tree on the grass with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all to myself nearly not entirely for there was a fellow on a horse looking down at me a fellow fresh out of a picture book he was in old time iron armor from head to heel with a helmet on his head the shape of a nail keg with slits in it and he had a shield and a sword and a prodigious spear and his horse had armor on too and a steel horn projecting from his forehead and gorgeous red and green silk trappings that hung down all around him like a bedquilt nearly to the ground fair sir will ye just said this fellow will i which will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for what are you giving me i said get along back to your circus or i ll report you now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards and then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear with his nail keg bent down nearly to his horses neck and his long spear pointed straight ahead i saw he meant business so i was up the tree when he arrived he allowed that i was his property the captive of his spear there was argument on his side and the bulk of the advantage so i judged it best to humor him we fixed up an agreement whereby i was to go with him and he was not to hurt me i came down and we started away i walking by the side of his horse we marched comfortably along through glades and over brooks which i could not remember to have seen before which puzzled me and made me wonder and yet we did not come to any circus or sign of a circus so i gave up the idea of a circus and concluded he was from an asylum but we never came to an asylum so i was up a stump as you may say i asked him how far we were from hartford he said he had never heard of the place which i took to be a lie but allowed it to go at that at the end of an hour we saw a far away town sleeping in a valley by a winding river and beyond it on a hill a vast gray fortress with towers and turrets the first i had ever seen out of a picture bridgeport said i pointing camelot said he my stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness he caught himself nodding now and smiled one of those pathetic obsolete smiles of his and said i find i cant go on but come with me i ve got it all written out and you can read it if you like in his chamber he said first i kept a journal then by and by after years i took the journal and turned it into a book how long ago that was he handed me his manuscript and pointed out the place where i should begin begin here i ve already told you what goes before he was steeped in drowsiness by this time as i went out at his door i heard him murmur sleepily give you good den fair sir i sat down by my fire and examined my treasure the first part of it the great bulk of it was parchment and yellow with age i scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest under the old dim writing of the yankee historian appeared traces of a penmanship which was older and dimmer still latin words and sentences fragments from old monkish legends evidently i turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read as follows the tale of the lost land chapter i camelot camelot camelot said i to myself i dont seem to remember hearing of it before name of the asylum likely it was a soft reposeful summer landscape as lovely as a dream and as lonesome as sunday the air was full of the smell of flowers and the buzzing of insects and the twittering of birds and there were no people no wagons there was no stir of life nothing going on the road was mainly a winding path with hoof prints in it and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side in the grass wheels that apparently had a tire as broad as ones hand presently a fair slip of a girl about ten years old with a cataract of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders came along around her head she wore a hoop of flame red poppies it was as sweet an outfit as ever i saw what there was of it she walked indolently along with a mind at rest its peace reflected in her innocent face the circus man paid no attention to her didnt even seem to see her and she she was no more startled at his fantastic make up than if she was used to his like every day of her life she was going by as indifferently as she might have gone by a couple of cows but when she happened to notice me then there was a change up went her hands and she was turned to stone her mouth dropped open her eyes stared wide and timorously she was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear and there she stood gazing in a sort of stupefied fascination till we turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view that she should be startled at me instead of at the other man was too many for me i couldnt make head or tail of it and that she should seem to consider me a spectacle and totally overlook her own merits in that respect was another puzzling thing and a display of magnanimity too that was surprising in one so young there was food for thought here i moved along as one in a dream as we approached the town signs of life began to appear at intervals we passed a wretched cabin with a thatched roof and about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of cultivation there were people too brawny men with long coarse uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them look like animals they and the women as a rule wore a coarse tow linen robe that came well below the knee and a rude sort of sandal and many wore an iron collar the small boys and girls were always naked but nobody seemed to know it all of these people stared at me talked about me ran into the huts and fetched out their families to gape at me but nobody ever noticed that other fellow except to make him humble salutation and get no response for their pains in the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins the streets were mere crooked alleys and unpaved troops of dogs and nude children played in the sun and made life and noise hogs roamed and rooted contentedly about and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in the middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family presently there was a distant blare of military music it came nearer still nearer and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting banners and rich doublets and horse cloths and gilded spearheads and through the muck and swine and naked brats and joyous dogs and shabby huts it took its gallant way and in its wake we followed followed through one winding alley and then another and climbing always climbing till at last we gained the breezy height where the huge castle stood there was an exchange of bugle blasts then a parley from the walls where men at arms in hauberk and morion marched back and forth with halberd at shoulder under flapping banners with the rude figure of a dragon displayed upon them and then the great gates were flung open the drawbridge was lowered and the head of the cavalcade swept forward under the frowning arches and we following soon found ourselves in a great paved court with towers and turrets stretching up into the blue air on all the four sides and all about us the dismount was going on and much greeting and ceremony and running to and fro and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors and an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion chapter ii king arthurs court the moment i got a chance i slipped aside privately and touched an ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said in an insinuating confidential way friend do me a kindness do you belong to the asylum or are you just on a visit or something like that he looked me over stupidly and said marry fair sir me seemeth that will do i said i reckon you are a patient i moved away cogitating and at the same time keeping an eye out for any chance passenger in his right mind that might come along and give me some light i judged i had found one presently so i drew him aside and said in his ear if i could see the head keeper a minute only just a minute prithee do not let me let you what hinder me then if the word please thee better then he went on to say he was an under cook and could not stop to gossip though he would like it another time for it would comfort his very liver to know where i got my clothes as he started away he pointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose and was seeking me besides no doubt this was an airy slim boy in shrimp colored tights that made him look like a forked carrot the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles and he had long yellow curls and wore a plumed pink satin cap tilted complacently over his ear by his look he was good natured by his gait he was satisfied with himself he was pretty enough to frame he arrived looked me over with a smiling and impudent curiosity said he had come for me and informed me that he was a page go long i said you aint more than a paragraph it was pretty severe but i was nettled however it never phazed him he didnt appear to know he was hurt he began to talk and laugh in happy thoughtless boyish fashion as we walked along and made himself old friends with me at once asked me all sorts of questions about myself and about my clothes but never waited for an answer always chattered straight ahead as if he didnt know he had asked a question and wasnt expecting any reply until at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning of the year it made the cold chills creep over me i stopped and said a little faintly maybe i didnt hear you just right say it again and say it slow what year was it you dont look it come my boy i am a stranger and friendless be honest and honorable with me are you in your right mind he said he was are these other people in their right minds he said they were and this isnt an asylum i mean it isnt a place where they cure crazy people he said it wasnt well then i said either i am a lunatic or something just as awful has happened now tell me honest and true where am i in king arthurs court i waited a minute to let that idea shudder its way home and then said and according to your notions what year is it now nineteenth of june i felt a mournful sinking at the heart and muttered i shall never see my friends again never never again they will not be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet i seemed to believe the boy i didnt know why something in me seemed to believe him my consciousness as you may say but my reason didnt my reason straightway began to clamor that was natural i didnt know how to go about satisfying it because i knew that the testimony of men wouldnt serve my reason would say they were lunatics and throw out their evidence but all of a sudden i stumbled on the very thing just by luck i knew that the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of the sixth century occurred on the st of june a do s and began at minutes after noon i also knew that no total eclipse of the sun was due in what to me was the present year i e so if i could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart out of me for forty eight hours i should then find out for certain whether this boy was telling me the truth or not wherefore being a practical connecticut man i now shoved this whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour should come in order that i might turn all my attention to the circumstances of the present moment and be alert and ready to make the most out of them that could be made one thing at a time is my motto and just play that thing for all it is worth even if its only two pair and a jack i made up my mind to two things if it was still the nineteenth century and i was among lunatics and couldnt get away i would presently boss that asylum or know the reason why and if on the other hand it was really the sixth century all right i didnt want any softer thing i would boss the whole country inside of three months for i judged i would have the start of the best educated man in the kingdom by a matter of thirteen hundred years and upward im not a man to waste time after my minds made up and theres work on hand so i said to the page now clarence my boy if that might happen to be your name i ll get you to post me up a little if you dont mind what is the name of that apparition that brought me here my master and thine that is the good knight and great lord sir kay the seneschal foster brother to our liege the king very good go on tell me everything he made a long story of it but the part that had immediate interest for me was this he said i was sir kays prisoner and that in the due course of custom i would be flung into a dungeon and left there on scant commons until my friends ransomed me unless i chanced to rot first i saw that the last chance had the best show but i didnt waste any bother about that time was too precious the page said further that dinner was about ended in the great hall by this time and that as soon as the sociability and the heavy drinking should begin sir kay would have me in and exhibit me before king arthur and his illustrious knights seated at the table round and would brag about his exploit in capturing me and would probably exaggerate the facts a little but it wouldnt be good form for me to correct him and not over safe either and when i was done being exhibited then ho for the dungeon but he clarence would find a way to come and see me every now and then and cheer me up and help me get word to my friends get word to my friends i thanked him i couldnt do less and about this time a lackey came to say i was wanted so clarence led me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me well it was a curious kind of spectacle and interesting it was an immense place and rather naked yes and full of loud contrasts it was very very lofty so lofty that the banners depending from the arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of twilight there was a stone railed gallery at each end high up with musicians in the one and women clothed in stunning colors in the other the floor was of big stone flags laid in black and white squares rather battered by age and use and needing repair as to ornament there wasnt any strictly speaking though on the walls hung some huge tapestries which were probably taxed as works of art battle pieces they were with horses shaped like those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by round holes so that the mans coat looks as if it had been done with a biscuit punch there was a fireplace big enough to camp in and its projecting sides and hood of carved and pillared stonework had the look of a cathedral door along the walls stood men at arms in breastplate and morion with halberds for their only weapon rigid as statues and that is what they looked like in the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oaken table which they called the table round it was as large as a circus ring and around it sat a great company of men dressed in such various and splendid colors that it hurt ones eyes to look at them they wore their plumed hats right along except that whenever one addressed himself directly to the king he lifted his hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark mainly they were drinking from entire ox horns but a few were still munching bread or gnawing beef bones there was about an average of two dogs to one man and these sat in expectant attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them and then they went for it by brigades and divisions with a rush and there ensued a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails and the storm of howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time but that was no matter for the dog fight was always a bigger interest anyway the men rose sometimes to observe it the better and bet on it and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out over their balusters with the same object and all broke into delighted ejaculations from time to time in the end the winning dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his paws and proceeded to growl over it and gnaw it and grease the floor with it just as fifty others were already doing and the rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments as a rule the speech and behavior of these people were gracious and courtly and i noticed that they were good and serious listeners when anybody was telling anything i mean in a dog fightless interval and plainly too they were a childlike and innocent lot telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and winning naivety and ready and willing to listen to anybody elses lie and believe it too it was hard to associate them with anything cruel or dreadful and yet they dealt in tales of blood and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget to shudder i was not the only prisoner present there were twenty or more poor devils many of them were maimed hacked carved in a frightful way and their hair their faces their clothing were caked with black and stiffened drenchings of blood they were suffering sharp physical pain of course and weariness and hunger and thirst no doubt and at least none had given them the comfort of a wash or even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan or saw them show any sign of restlessness or any disposition to complain the thought was forced upon me the rascals they have served other people so in their day it being their own turn now they were not expecting any better treatment than this so their philosophical bearing is not an outcome of mental training intellectual fortitude reasoning it is mere animal training they are white indians chapter iii knights of the table round mainly the round table talk was monologues narrative accounts of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their friends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor as a general thing as far as i could make out these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out no as a rule they were simply duels between strangers duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever many a time i had seen a couple of boys strangers meet by chance and say simultaneously i can lick you and go at it on the spot but i had always imagined until now that that sort of thing belonged to children only and was a sign and mark of childhood but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond yet there was something very engaging about these great simple hearted creatures something attractive and lovable there did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery so to speak to bait a fish hook with but you didnt seem to mind that after a little because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that and indeed would have marred it hindered it spoiled its symmetry perhaps rendered its existence impossible there was a fine manliness observable in almost every face and in some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked your belittling criticisms and stilled them a most noble benignity and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called sir galahad and likewise in the kings also and there was majesty and greatness in the giant frame and high bearing of sir launcelot of the lake there was presently an incident which centered the general interest upon this sir launcelot at a sign from a sort of master of ceremonies six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward the ladies gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen the most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flower bed of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his fellows into her hands for free pardon ransom captivity or death as she in her good pleasure might elect and this as he said he was doing by command of sir kay the seneschal whose prisoners they were he having vanquished them by his single might and prowess in sturdy conflict in the field surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over the house the queens gratified smile faded out at the name of sir kay and she looked disappointed and the page whispered in my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision sir kay forsooth oh call me pet names dearest call me a marine in twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention of man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon sir kay but he was equal to the occasion he got up and played his hand like a major and took every trick he said he would state the case exactly according to the facts he would tell the simple straightforward tale without comment of his own and then said he if ye find glory and honor due ye will give it unto him who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or strake with sword in the ranks of christian battle even him that sitteth there and he pointed to sir launcelot ah he fetched them it was a rattling good stroke then he went on and told how sir launcelot seeking adventures some brief time gone by killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword and set a hundred and forty two captive maidens free and then went further still seeking adventures and found him sir kay fighting a desperate fight against nine foreign knights and straightway took the battle solely into his own hands and conquered the nine and that night sir launcelot rose quietly and dressed him in sir kays armor and took sir kays horse and gat him away into distant lands and vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty four in another and all these and the former nine he made to swear that about whitsuntide they would ride to arthurs court and yield them to queen guenevers hands as captives of sir kay the seneschal spoil of his knightly prowess and now here were these half dozen and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of their desperate wounds well it was touching to see the queen blush and smile and look embarrassed and happy and fling furtive glances at sir launcelot that would have got him shot in arkansas to a dead certainty everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of sir launcelot and as for me i was perfectly amazed that one man all by himself should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions of practiced fighters i said as much to clarence but this mocking featherhead only said an sir kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him ye had seen the accompt doubled i looked at the boy in sorrow and as i looked i saw the cloud of a deep despondency settle upon his countenance i followed the direction of his eye and saw that a very old and white bearded man clothed in a flowing black gown had risen and was standing at the table upon unsteady legs and feebly swaying his ancient head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye the same suffering look that was in the pages face was observable in all the faces around the look of dumb creatures who know that they must endure and make no moan marry we shall have it again sighed the boy that same old weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words and that he will tell till he dieth every time he hath gotten his barrel full and feeleth his exaggeration mill a working would god i had died or i saw this day who is it merlin the mighty liar and magician perdition singe him for the weariness he worketh with his one tale but that men fear him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the devils that be in hell at his beck and call they would have dug his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and squelch it he telleth it always in the third person making believe he is too modest to glorify himself maledictions light upon him misfortune be his dole good friend prithee call me for evensong the boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go to sleep the old man began his tale and presently the lad was asleep in reality so also were the dogs and the court the lackeys and the files of men at arms the droning voice droned on a soft snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued accompaniment of wind instruments some heads were bowed upon folded arms some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious music the flies buzzed and bit unmolested the rats swarmed softly out from a hundred holes and pattered about and made themselves at home everywhere and one of them sat up like a squirrel on the kings head and held a bit of cheese in its hands and nibbled it and dribbled the crumbs in the kings face with naive and impudent irreverence it was a tranquil scene and restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit this was the old mans tale he said right so the king and merlin departed and went until an hermit that was a good man and a great leech so the hermit searched all his wounds and gave him good salves so the king was there three days and then were his wounds well amended that he might ride and go and so departed and as they rode arthur said i have no sword no force footnote from m t no matter said merlin hereby is a sword that shall be yours and i may so they rode till they came to a lake the which was a fair water and broad and in the midst of the lake arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite that held a fair sword in that hand lo said merlin yonder is that sword that i spake of with that they saw a damsel going upon the lake what damsel is that said arthur that is the lady of the lake said merlin and within that lake is a rock and therein is as fair a place as any on earth and richly beseen and this damsel will come to you anon and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword anon withal came the damsel unto arthur and saluted him and he her again damsel said arthur what sword is that that yonder the arm holdeth above the water i would it were mine for i have no sword sir arthur king said the damsel that sword is mine and if ye will give me a gift when i ask it you ye shall have it by my faith said arthur i will give you what gift ye will ask well said the damsel go ye into yonder barge and row yourself to the sword and take it and the scabbard with you and i will ask my gift when i see my time so sir arthur and merlin alight and tied their horses to two trees and so they went into the ship and when they came to the sword that the hand held sir arthur took it up by the handles and took it with him and the arm and the hand went under the water and so they came unto the land and rode forth and then sir arthur saw a rich pavilion what signifieth yonder pavilion it is the knights pavilion said merlin that ye fought with last sir pellinore but he is out he is not there he hath ado with a knight of yours that hight egglame and they have fought together but at the last egglame fled and else he had been dead and he hath chased him even to carlion and we shall meet with him anon in the highway that is well said said arthur now have i a sword now will i wage battle with him and be avenged on him sir ye shall not so said merlin for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him also he will not lightly be matched of one knight living and therefore it is my counsel let him pass for he shall do you good service in short time and his sons after his days also ye shall see that day in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed when i see him i will do as ye advise me said arthur then sir arthur looked on the sword and liked it passing well whether liketh you better said merlin the sword or the scabbard me liketh better the sword said arthur ye are more unwise said merlin for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword for while ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood be ye never so sore wounded therefore keep well the scabbard always with you so they rode into carlion and by the way they met with sir pellinore but merlin had done such a craft that pellinore saw not arthur and he passed by without any words i marvel said arthur that the knight would not speak sir said merlin he saw you not for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed so they came unto carlion whereof his knights were passing glad and when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would jeopard his person so alone but all men of worship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in adventure as other poor knights did chapter iv sir dinadan the humorist it seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully told but then i had heard it only once and that makes a difference it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh no doubt sir dinadan the humorist was the first to awake and he soon roused the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality he tied some metal mugs to a dogs tail and turned him loose and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and crashing against everything that came in their way and making altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and turmoil at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed till the tears flowed and some fell out of their chairs and wallowed on the floor in ecstasy it was just like so many children sir dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep from telling over and over again to weariness how the immortal idea happened to occur to him and as is the way with humorists of his breed he was still laughing at it after everybody else had got through he was so set up that he concluded to make a speech of course a humorous speech i think i never heard so many old played out jokes strung together in my life he was worse than the minstrels worse than the clown in the circus it seemed peculiarly sad to sit here thirteen hundred years before i was born and listen again to poor flat worm eaten jokes that had given me the dry gripes when i was a boy thirteen hundred years afterwards it about convinced me that there isnt any such thing as a new joke possible everybody laughed at these antiquities but then they always do i had noticed that centuries later however of course the scoffer didnt laugh i mean the boy no he scoffed there wasnt anything he wouldnt scoff at he said the most of sir dinadans jokes were rotten and the rest were petrified i said petrified was good as i believed myself that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of those jokes was by geologic periods but that neat idea hit the boy in a blank place for geology hadnt been invented yet however i made a note of the remark and calculated to educate the commonwealth up to it if i pulled through it is no use to throw a good thing away merely because the market isnt ripe yet now sir kay arose and began to fire up on his history mill with me for fuel it was time for me to feel serious and i did sir kay told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians who all wore the same ridiculous garb that i did a garb that was a work of enchantment and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt by human hands however he had nullified the force of the enchantment by prayer and had killed my thirteen knights in a three hours battle and taken me prisoner sparing my life in order that so strange a curiosity as i was might be exhibited to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court he spoke of me all the time in the blandest way as this prodigious giant and this horrible sky towering monster and this tusked and taloned man devouring ogre and everybody took in all this bosh in the naivest way and never smiled or seemed to notice that there was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me he said that in trying to escape from him i sprang into the top of a tree two hundred cubits high at a single bound but he dislodged me with a stone the size of a cow which all to brast the most of my bones and then swore me to appear at arthurs court for sentence he ended by condemning me to die at noon on the st and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before he named the date i was in a dismal state by this time indeed i was hardly enough in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as to how i had better be killed the possibility of the killing being doubted by some because of the enchantment in my clothes and yet it was nothing but an ordinary suit of fifteen dollar slop shops still i was sane enough to notice this detail to wit many of the terms used in the most matter of fact way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land would have made a comanche blush indelicacy is too mild a term to convey the idea however i had read tom jones and roderick random and other books of that kind and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in england had remained little or no cleaner in their talk and in the morals and conduct which such talk implies clear up to a hundred years ago in fact clear into our own nineteenth century in which century broadly speaking the earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable in english history or in european history for that matter may be said to have made their appearance suppose sir walter instead of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters had allowed the characters to speak for themselves we should have had talk from rebecca and ivanhoe and the soft lady rowena which would embarrass a tramp in our day however to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate king arthurs people were not aware that they were indecent and i had presence of mind enough not to mention it they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were mightily relieved at last when old merlin swept the difficulty away for them with a common sense hint he asked them why they were so dull why didnt it occur to them to strip me in half a minute i was as naked as a pair of tongs and dear dear to think of it i was the only embarrassed person there everybody discussed me and did it as unconcernedly as if i had been a cabbage queen guenever was as naively interested as the rest and said she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before it was the only compliment i got if it was a compliment finally i was carried off in one direction and my perilous clothes in another i was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon with some scant remnants for dinner some moldy straw for a bed and no end of rats for company chapter v an inspiration i was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long when i next came to myself i seemed to have been asleep a very long time my first thought was well what an astonishing dream i ve had i reckon i ve waked only just in time to keep from being hanged or drowned or burned or something i ll nap again till the whistle blows and then i ll go down to the arms factory and have it out with hercules but just then i heard the harsh music of rusty chains and bolts a light flashed in my eyes and that butterfly clarence stood before me i gasped with surprise my breath almost got away from me what i said you here yet go along with the rest of the dream scatter but he only laughed in his light hearted way and fell to making fun of my sorry plight all right i said resignedly let the dream go on im in no hurry prithee what dream what dream why the dream that i am in arthurs court a person who never existed and that i am talking to you who are nothing but a work of the imagination oh la indeed and is it a dream that you re to be burned to morrow ho ho answer me that the shock that went through me was distressing i now began to reason that my situation was in the last degree serious dream or no dream for i knew by past experience of the lifelike intensity of dreams that to be burned to death even in a dream would be very far from being a jest and was a thing to be avoided by any means fair or foul that i could contrive so i said beseechingly ah clarence good boy only friend i ve got for you are my friend arent you dont fail me help me to devise some way of escaping from this place now do but hear thyself escape why man the corridors are in guard and keep of men at arms no doubt no doubt but how many clarence not many i hope full a score one may not hope to escape after a pause hesitatingly and there be other reasons and weightier other ones what are they well they say oh but i darent indeed darent why poor lad what is the matter why do you blench why do you tremble so oh in sooth there is need i do want to tell you but come come be brave be a man speak out theres a good lad he hesitated pulled one way by desire the other way by fear then he stole to the door and peeped out listening and finally crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his fearful news in a whisper and with all the cowering apprehension of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things whose very mention might be freighted with death merlin in his malice has woven a spell about this dungeon and there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate enough to essay to cross its lines with you now god pity me i have told it ah be kind to me be merciful to a poor boy who means thee well for an thou betray me i am lost i laughed the only really refreshing laugh i had had for some time and shouted merlin has wrought a spell merlin forsooth that cheap old humbug that maundering old ass bosh pure bosh the silliest bosh in the world why it does seem to me that of all the childish idiotic chuckle headed chicken livered superstitions that ev oh damn merlin but clarence had slumped to his knees before i had half finished and he was like to go out of his mind with fright oh beware these are awful words any moment these walls may crumble upon us if you say such things oh call them back before it is too late now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to thinking if everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely afraid of merlins pretended magic as clarence was certainly a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive some way to take advantage of such a state of things i went on thinking and worked out a plan then i said get up pull yourself together look me in the eye do you know why i laughed no but for our blessed ladys sake do it no more well i ll tell you why i laughed because im a magician myself thou the boy recoiled a step and caught his breath for the thing hit him rather sudden but the aspect which he took on was very very respectful i took quick note of that it indicated that a humbug didnt need to have a reputation in this asylum people stood ready to take him at his word without that i resumed i ve known merlin seven hundred years and he seven hun dont interrupt me he has died and come alive again thirteen times and traveled under a new name every time smith jones robinson jackson peters haskins merlin a new alias every time he turns up i knew him in egypt three hundred years ago i knew him in india five hundred years ago he is always blethering around in my way everywhere i go he makes me tired he dont amount to shucks as a magician knows some of the old common tricks but has never got beyond the rudiments and never will he is well enough for the provinces one night stands and that sort of thing you know but dear me he oughtnt to set up for an expert anyway not where theres a real artist now look here clarence i am going to stand your friend right along and in return you must be mine i want you to do me a favor i want you to get word to the king that i am a magician myself and the supreme grand high yu muck amuck and head of the tribe at that and i want him to be made to understand that i am just quietly arranging a little calamity here that will make the fur fly in these realms if sir kays project is carried out and any harm comes to me will you get that to the king for me the poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me it was pitiful to see a creature so terrified so unnerved so demoralized but he promised everything and on my side he made me promise over and over again that i would remain his friend and never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him then he worked his way out staying himself with his hand along the wall like a sick person presently this thought occurred to me how heedless i have been when the boy gets calm he will wonder why a great magician like me should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place he will put this and that together and will see that i am a humbug i worried over that heedless blunder for an hour and called myself a great many hard names meantime but finally it occurred to me all of a sudden that these animals didnt reason that they never put this and that together that all their talk showed that they didnt know a discrepancy when they saw it i was at rest then but as soon as one is at rest in this world off he goes on something else to worry about it occurred to me that i had made another blunder i had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with a threat i intending to invent a calamity at my leisure now the people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to swallow miracles are the very ones who are hungriest to see you perform them suppose i should be called on for a sample suppose i should be asked to name my calamity yes i had made a blunder i ought to have invented my calamity first what shall i do what can i say to gain a little time i was in trouble again in the deepest kind of trouble theres a footstep they re coming if i had only just a moment to think good i ve got it im all right you see it was the eclipse it came into my mind in the nick of time how columbus or cortez or one of those people played an eclipse as a saving trump once on some savages and i saw my chance i could play it myself now and it wouldnt be any plagiarism either because i should get it in nearly a thousand years ahead of those parties clarence came in subdued distressed and said i hasted the message to our liege the king and straightway he had me to his presence he was frighted even to the marrow and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement and that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so great but then came merlin and spoiled all for he persuaded the king that you are mad and know not whereof you speak and said your threat is but foolishness and idle vaporing they disputed long but in the end merlin scoffing said wherefore hath he not named his brave calamity verily it is because he cannot this thrust did in a most sudden sort close the kings mouth and he could offer naught to turn the argument and so reluctant and full loth to do you the discourtesy he yet prayeth you to consider his perplexed case as noting how the matter stands and name the calamity if so be you have determined the nature of it and the time of its coming oh prithee delay not to delay at such a time were to double and treble the perils that already compass thee about oh be thou wise name the calamity i allowed silence to accumulate while i got my impressiveness together and then said how long have i been shut up in this hole ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent it is of the morning now no then i have slept well sure enough nine in the morning now and yet it is the very complexion of midnight to a shade this is the th then the th yes and i am to be burned alive to morrow the boy shuddered at what hour at high noon now then i will tell you what to say i paused and stood over that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence then in a voice deep measured charged with doom i began and rose by dramatically graded stages to my colossal climax which i delivered in as sublime and noble a way as ever i did such a thing in my life go back and tell the king that at that hour i will smother the whole world in the dead blackness of midnight i will blot out the sun and he shall never shine again the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack of light and warmth and the peoples of the earth shall famish and die to the last man i had to carry the boy out myself he sunk into such a collapse i handed him over to the soldiers and went back chapter vi the eclipse in the stillness and the darkness realization soon began to supplement knowledge the mere knowledge of a fact is pale but when you come to realize your fact it takes on color it is all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to the heart and seeing it done in the stillness and the darkness the knowledge that i was in deadly danger took to itself deeper and deeper meaning all the time a something which was realization crept inch by inch through my veins and turned me cold but it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these as soon as a mans mercury has got down to a certain point there comes a revulsion and he rallies hope springs up and cheerfulness along with it and then he is in good shape to do something for himself if anything can be done when my rally came it came with a bound i said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides and straightway my mercury went up to the top of the tube and my solicitudes all vanished i was as happy a man as there was in the world i was even impatient for to morrow to come i so wanted to gather in that great triumph and be the center of all the nations wonder and reverence besides in a business way it would be the making of me i knew that meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the background of my mind that was the half conviction that when the nature of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious people it would have such an effect that they would want to compromise so by and by when i heard footsteps coming that thought was recalled to me and i said to myself as sure as anything its the compromise well if it is good all right i will accept but if it isnt i mean to stand my ground and play my hand for all it is worth the door opened and some men at arms appeared the leader said the stake is ready come the stake the strength went out of me and i almost fell down it is hard to get ones breath at such a time such lumps come into ones throat and such gaspings but as soon as i could speak i said but this is a mistake the execution is to morrow order changed been set forward a day haste thee i was lost there was no help for me i was dazed stupefied i had no command over myself i only wandered purposely about like one out of his mind so the soldiers took hold of me and pulled me along with them out of the cell and along the maze of underground corridors and finally into the fierce glare of daylight and the upper world as we stepped into the vast enclosed court of the castle i got a shock for the first thing i saw was the stake standing in the center and near it the piled fagots and a monk on all four sides of the court the seated multitudes rose rank above rank forming sloping terraces that were rich with color the king and the queen sat in their thrones the most conspicuous figures there of course to note all this occupied but a second the next second clarence had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring news into my ear his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness he said tis through me the change was wrought and main hard have i worked to do it too but when i revealed to them the calamity in store and saw how mighty was the terror it did engender then saw i also that this was the time to strike wherefore i diligently pretended unto this and that and the other one that your power against the sun could not reach its full until the morrow and so if any would save the sun and the world you must be slain to day while your enchantments are but in the weaving and lack potency odsbodikins it was but a dull lie a most indifferent invention but you should have seen them seize it and swallow it in the frenzy of their fright as it were salvation sent from heaven and all the while was i laughing in my sleeve the one moment to see them so cheaply deceived and glorifying god the next that he was content to let the meanest of his creatures be his instrument to the saving of thy life ah how happy has the matter sped you will not need to do the sun a real hurt ah forget not that on your soul forget it not only make a little darkness only the littlest little darkness mind and cease with that it will be sufficient they will see that i spoke falsely being ignorant as they will fancy and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you shall see them go mad with fear and they will set you free and make you great go to thy triumph now but remember ah good friend i implore thee remember my supplication and do the blessed sun no hurt for my sake thy true friend i choked out some words through my grief and misery as much as to say i would spare the sun for which the lads eyes paid me back with such deep and loving gratitude that i had not the heart to tell him his good hearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me to my death as the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was so profound that if i had been blindfold i should have supposed i was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people there was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity they were as rigid as stone images and as pale and dread sat upon every countenance this hush continued while i was being chained to the stake it still continued while the fagots were carefully and tediously piled about my ankles my knees my thighs my body then there was a pause and a deeper hush if possible and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch the multitude strained forward gazing and parting slightly from their seats without knowing it the monk raised his hands above my head and his eyes toward the blue sky and began some words in latin in this attitude he droned on and on a little while and then stopped i waited two or three moments then looked up he was standing there petrified with a common impulse the multitude rose slowly up and stared into the sky i followed their eyes as sure as guns there was my eclipse beginning the life went boiling through my veins i was a new man the rim of black spread slowly into the suns disk my heart beat higher and higher and still the assemblage and the priest stared into the sky motionless i knew that this gaze would be turned upon me next when it was i was ready i was in one of the most grand attitudes i ever struck with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun it was a noble effect you could see the shudder sweep the mass like a wave two shouts rang out one close upon the heels of the other apply the torch i forbid it the one was from merlin the other from the king merlin started from his place to apply the torch himself i judged i said stay where you are if any man moves even the king before i give him leave i will blast him with thunder i will consume him with lightnings the multitude sank meekly into their seats and i was just expecting they would merlin hesitated a moment or two and i was on pins and needles during that little while then he sat down and i took a good breath for i knew i was master of the situation now the king said be merciful fair sir and essay no further in this perilous matter lest disaster follow it was reported to us that your powers could not attain unto their full strength until the morrow but your majesty thinks the report may have been a lie it was a lie that made an immense effect up went appealing hands everywhere and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that i might be bought off at any price and the calamity stayed the king was eager to comply he said name any terms reverend sir even to the halving of my kingdom but banish this calamity spare the sun my fortune was made i would have taken him up in a minute but i couldnt stop an eclipse the thing was out of the question so i asked time to consider the king said how long ah how long good sir be merciful look it groweth darker moment by moment prithee how long not long half an hour maybe an hour there were a thousand pathetic protests but i couldnt shorten up any for i couldnt remember how long a total eclipse lasts i was in a puzzled condition anyway and wanted to think something was wrong about that eclipse and the fact was very unsettling if this wasnt the one i was after how was i to tell whether this was the sixth century or nothing but a dream dear me if i could only prove it was the latter here was a glad new hope if the boy was right about the date and this was surely the th it wasnt the sixth century i reached for the monks sleeve in considerable excitement and asked him what day of the month it was hang him he said it was the twenty first it made me turn cold to hear him i begged him not to make any mistake about it but he was sure he knew it was the st so that feather headed boy had botched things again the time of the day was right for the eclipse i had seen that for myself in the beginning by the dial that was near by yes i was in king arthurs court and i might as well make the most out of it i could the darkness was steadily growing the people becoming more and more distressed i now said i have reflected sir king for a lesson i will let this darkness proceed and spread night in the world but whether i blot out the sun for good or restore it shall rest with you these are the terms to wit you shall remain king over all your dominions and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase of revenue over and above its present amount as i may succeed in creating for the state if i cant live on that i shan t ask anybody to give me a lift is it satisfactory there was a prodigious roar of applause and out of the midst of it the kings voice rose saying away with his bonds and set him free and do him homage high and low rich and poor for he is become the kings right hand is clothed with power and authority and his seat is upon the highest step of the throne now sweep away this creeping night and bring the light and cheer again that all the world may bless thee but i said that a common man should be shamed before the world is nothing but it were dishonor to the king if any that saw his minister naked should not also see him delivered from his shame if i might ask that my clothes be brought again they are not meet the king broke in fetch raiment of another sort clothe him like a prince my idea worked i wanted to keep things as they were till the eclipse was total otherwise they would be trying again to get me to dismiss the darkness and of course i couldnt do it sending for the clothes gained some delay but not enough so i had to make another excuse i said it would be but natural if the king should change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done under excitement therefore i would let the darkness grow a while and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind the same the darkness should be dismissed neither the king nor anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement but i had to stick to my point it grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker while i struggled with those awkward sixth century clothes it got to be pitch dark at last and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars come out and twinkle in the sky at last the eclipse was total and i was very glad of it but everybody else was in misery which was quite natural i said the king by his silence still stands to the terms then i lifted up my hands stood just so a moment then i said with the most awful solemnity let the enchantment dissolve and pass harmless away there was no response for a moment in that deep darkness and that graveyard hush but when the silver rim of the sun pushed itself out a moment or two later the assemblage broke loose with a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me with blessings and gratitude and clarence was not the last of the wash to be sure chapter vii merlins tower inasmuch as i was now the second personage in the kingdom as far as political power and authority were concerned much was made of me my raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold and by consequence was very showy also uncomfortable but habit would soon reconcile me to my clothes i was aware of that i was given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle after the kings they were aglow with loud colored silken hangings but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet and they were misfit rushes at that being not all of one breed as for conveniences properly speaking there werent any i mean little conveniences it is the little conveniences that make the real comfort of life the big oaken chairs graced with rude carvings were well enough but that was the stopping place there was no soap no matches no looking glass except a metal one about as powerful as a pail of water and not a chromo i had been used to chromos for years and i saw now that without my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric of my being and was become a part of me it made me homesick to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness and remember that in our house in east hartford all unpretending as it was you couldnt go into a room but you would find an insurance chromo or at least a three color god bless our home over the door and in the parlor we had nine but here even in my grand room of state there wasnt anything in the nature of a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt which was either woven or knitted it had darned places in it and nothing in it was the right color or the right shape and as for proportions even raphael himself couldnt have botched them more formidably after all his practice on those nightmares they call his celebrated hampton court cartoons raphael was a bird we had several of his chromos one was his miraculous draught of fishes where he puts in a miracle of his own puts three men into a canoe which wouldnt have held a dog without upsetting i always admired to study rs art it was so fresh and unconventional there wasnt even a bell or a speaking tube in the castle i had a great many servants and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom and when i wanted one of them i had to go and call for him there was no gas there were no candles a bronze dish half full of boarding house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light a lot of these hung along the walls and modified the dark just toned it down enough to make it dismal if you went out at night your servants carried torches there were no books pens paper or ink and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows it is a little thing glass is until it is absent then it becomes a big thing but perhaps the worst of all was that there wasnt any sugar coffee tea or tobacco i saw that i was just another robinson crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island with no society but some more or less tame animals and if i wanted to make life bearable i must do as he did invent contrive create reorganize things set brain and hand to work and keep them busy well that was in my line one thing troubled me along at first the immense interest which people took in me apparently the whole nation wanted a look at me it soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the british world almost to death that while it lasted the whole country from one end to the other was in a pitiable state of panic and the churches hermitages and monkeries overflowed with praying and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was come then had followed the news that the producer of this awful event was a stranger a mighty magician at arthurs court that he could have blown out the sun like a candle and was just going to do it when his mercy was purchased and he then dissolved his enchantments and was now recognized and honored as the man who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and its peoples from extinction now if you consider that everybody believed that and not only believed it but never even dreamed of doubting it you will easily understand that there was not a person in all britain that would not have walked fifty miles to get a sight of me of course i was all the talk all other subjects were dropped even the king became suddenly a person of minor interest and notoriety within twenty four hours the delegations began to arrive and from that time onward for a fortnight they kept coming the village was crowded and all the countryside i had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these reverent and awe stricken multitudes it came to be a great burden as to time and trouble but of course it was at the same time compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center of homage it turned brer merlin green with envy and spite which was a great satisfaction to me but there was one thing i couldnt understand nobody had asked for an autograph i spoke to clarence about it by george i had to explain to him what it was then he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen priests land think of that there was another thing that troubled me a little those multitudes presently began to agitate for another miracle that was natural to be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they had seen the man who could command the sun riding in the heavens and be obeyed would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors and envied by them all but to be able to also say they had seen him work a miracle themselves why people would come a distance to see them the pressure got to be pretty strong there was going to be an eclipse of the moon and i knew the date and hour but it was too far away two years i would have given a good deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was a big market for it it seemed a great pity to have it wasted so and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldnt have any use for it as like as not if it had been booked for only a month away i could have sold it short but as matters stood i couldnt seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good so i gave up trying next clarence found that old merlin was making himself busy on the sly among those people he was spreading a report that i was a humbug and that the reason i didnt accommodate the people with a miracle was because i couldnt i saw that i must do something i presently thought out a plan by my authority as executive i threw merlin into prison the same cell i had occupied myself then i gave public notice by herald and trumpet that i should be busy with affairs of state for a fortnight but about the end of that time i would take a moments leisure and blow up merlins stone tower by fires from heaven in the meantime whoso listened to evil reports about me let him beware furthermore i would perform but this one miracle at this time and no more if it failed to satisfy and any murmured i would turn the murmurers into horses and make them useful quiet ensued i took clarence into my confidence to a certain degree and we went to work privately i told him that this was a sort of miracle that required a trifle of preparation and that it would be sudden death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody that made his mouth safe enough clandestinely we made a few bushels of first rate blasting powder and i superintended my armorers while they constructed a lightning rod and some wires this old stone tower was very massive and rather ruinous too for it was roman and four hundred years old yes and handsome after a rude fashion and clothed with ivy from base to summit as with a shirt of scale mail it stood on a lonely eminence in good view from the castle and about half a mile away working by night we stowed the powder in the tower dug stones out on the inside and buried the powder in the walls themselves which were fifteen feet thick at the base we put in a peck at a time in a dozen places we could have blown up the tower of london with these charges when the thirteenth night was come we put up our lightning rod bedded it in one of the batches of powder and ran wires from it to the other batches everybody had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation but on the morning of the fourteenth i thought best to warn the people through the heralds to keep clear away a quarter of a mile away then added by command that at some time during the twenty four hours i would consummate the miracle but would first give a brief notice by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime by torch baskets in the same places if at night thunder showers had been tolerably frequent of late and i was not much afraid of a failure still i shouldnt have cared for a delay of a day or two i should have explained that i was busy with affairs of state yet and the people must wait of course we had a blazing sunny day almost the first one without a cloud for three weeks things always happen so i kept secluded and watched the weather clarence dropped in from time to time and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the time and the whole country filling up with human masses as far as one could see from the battlements at last the wind sprang up and a cloud appeared in the right quarter too and just at nightfall for a little while i watched that distant cloud spread and blacken then i judged it was time for me to appear i ordered the torch baskets to be lit and merlin liberated and sent to me a quarter of an hour later i ascended the parapet and there found the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness toward merlins tower already the darkness was so heavy that one could not see far these people and the old turrets being partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great torch baskets overhead made a good deal of a picture merlin arrived in a gloomy mood i said you wanted to burn me alive when i had not done you any harm and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional reputation therefore i am going to call down fire and blow up your tower but it is only fair to give you a chance now if you think you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires step to the bat its your innings i can fair sir and i will doubt it not he drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof and burnt a pinch of powder in it which sent up a small cloud of aromatic smoke whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves and get uncomfortable then he began to mutter and make passes in the air with his hands he worked himself up slowly and gradually into a sort of frenzy and got to thrashing around with his arms like the sails of a windmill by this time the storm had about reached us the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and making the shadows swash about the first heavy drops of rain were falling the world abroad was black as pitch the lightning began to wink fitfully of course my rod would be loading itself now in fact things were imminent so i said you have had time enough i have given you every advantage and not interfered it is plain your magic is weak it is only fair that i begin now i made about three passes in the air and then there was an awful crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks along with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground in a general collapse of consternation well it rained mortar and masonry the rest of the week this was the report but probably the facts would have modified it it was an effective miracle the great bothersome temporary population vanished there were a good many thousand tracks in the mud the next morning but they were all outward bound if i had advertised another miracle i couldnt have raised an audience with a sheriff merlins stock was flat the king wanted to stop his wages he even wanted to banish him but i interfered i said he would be useful to work the weather and attend to small matters like that and i would give him a lift now and then when his poor little parlor magic soured on him there wasnt a rag of his tower left but i had the government rebuild it for him and advised him to take boarders but he was too high toned for that and as for being grateful he never even said thank you he was a rather hard lot take him how you might but then you couldnt fairly expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so chapter viii the boss to be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing but to have the on looking world consent to it is a finer the tower episode solidified my power and made it impregnable if any were perchance disposed to be jealous and critical before that they experienced a change of heart now there was not any one in the kingdom who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters i was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances for a time i used to wake up mornings and smile at my dream and listen for the colts factory whistle but that sort of thing played itself out gradually and at last i was fully able to realize that i was actually living in the sixth century and in arthurs court not a lunatic asylum after that i was just as much at home in that century as i could have been in any other and as for preference i wouldnt have traded it for the twentieth look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge brains pluck and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country the grandest field that ever was and all my own not a competitor not a man who wasnt a baby to me in acquirements and capacities whereas what would i amount to in the twentieth century i should be foreman of a factory that is about all and could drag a seine down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself what a jump i had made i couldnt keep from thinking about it and contemplating it just as one does who has struck oil there was nothing back of me that could approach it unless it might be josephs case and josephs only approached it it didnt equal it quite for it stands to reason that as josephs splendid financial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king the general public must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor whereas i had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun and was popular by reason of it i was no shadow of a king i was the substance the king himself was the shadow my power was colossal and it was not a mere name as such things have generally been it was the genuine article i stood here at the very spring and source of the second great period of the worlds history and could see the trickling stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden and roll its mighty tides down the far centuries and i could note the upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long array of thrones de montforts gavestons mortimers villierses the war making campaign directing wantons of france and charles the seconds scepter wielding drabs but nowhere in the procession was my full sized fellow visible i was a unique and glad to know that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen centuries and a half for sure yes in power i was equal to the king at the same time there was another power that was a trifle stronger than both of us put together that was the church i do not wish to disguise that fact i couldnt if i wanted to but never mind about that now it will show up in its proper place later on it didnt cause me any trouble in the beginning at least any of consequence well it was a curious country and full of interest and the people they were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race why they were nothing but rabbits it was pitiful for a person born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and church and nobility as if they had any more occasion to love and honor king and church and noble than a slave has to love and honor the lash or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him why dear me any kind of royalty howsoever modified any kind of aristocracy howsoever pruned is rightly an insult but if you are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never find it out for yourself and dont believe it when somebody else tells you it is enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or reason and the seventh rate people that have always figured as its aristocracies a company of monarchs and nobles who as a rule would have achieved only poverty and obscurity if left like their betters to their own exertions the most of king arthurs british nation were slaves pure and simple and bore that name and wore the iron collar on their necks and the rest were slaves in fact but without the name they imagined themselves men and freemen and called themselves so the truth was the nation as a body was in the world for one object and one only to grovel before king and church and noble to slave for them sweat blood for them starve that they might be fed work that they might play drink misery to the dregs that they might be happy go naked that they might wear silks and jewels pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures of adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves the gods of this world and for all this the thanks they got were cuffs and contempt and so poor spirited were they that they took even this sort of attention as an honor inherited ideas are a curious thing and interesting to observe and examine i had mine the king and his people had theirs in both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason and argument would have had a long contract on his hands for instance those people had inherited the idea that all men without title and a long pedigree whether they had great natural gifts and acquirements or hadnt were creatures of no more consideration than so many animals bugs insects whereas i had inherited the idea that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock shams of inherited dignities and unearned titles are of no good but to be laughed at the way i was looked upon was odd but it was natural you know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant in the menagerie well that is the idea they are full of admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength they speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels which are far and away beyond their own powers and they speak with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able to drive a thousand men before him but does that make him one of them no the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at the idea he couldnt comprehend it couldnt take it in couldnt in any remote way conceive of it well to the king the nobles and all the nation down to the very slaves and tramps i was just that kind of an elephant and nothing more i was admired also feared but it was as an animal is admired and feared the animal is not reverenced neither was i i was not even respected i had no pedigree no inherited title so in the kings and nobles eyes i was mere dirt the people regarded me with wonder and awe but there was no reverence mixed with it through the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship there you see the hand of that awful power the roman catholic church in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms before the day of the churchs supremacy in the world men were men and held their heads up and had a mans pride and spirit and independence and what of greatness and position a person got he got mainly by achievement not by birth but then the church came to the front with an axe to grind and she was wise subtle and knew more than one way to skin a cat or a nation she invented divine right of kings and propped it all around brick by brick with the beatitudes wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify an evil one she preached to the commoner humility obedience to superiors the beauty of self sacrifice she preached to the commoner meekness under insult preached still to the commoner always to the commoner patience meanness of spirit non resistance under oppression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies and taught all the christian populations of the earth to bow down to them and worship them even down to my birth century that poison was still in the blood of christendom and the best of english commoners was still content to see his inferiors impudently continuing to hold a number of positions such as lordships and the throne to which the grotesque laws of his country did not allow him to aspire in fact he was not merely contented with this strange condition of things he was even able to persuade himself that he was proud of it it seems to show that there isnt anything you cant stand if you are only born and bred to it of course that taint that reverence for rank and title had been in our american blood too i know that but when i left america it had disappeared at least to all intents and purposes the remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses when a disease has worked its way down to that level it may fairly be said to be out of the system but to return to my anomalous position in king arthurs kingdom here i was a giant among pigmies a man among children a master intelligence among intellectual moles by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole british world and yet there and then just as in the remote england of my birth time the sheep witted earl who could claim long descent from a kings leman acquired at second hand from the slums of london was a better man than i was such a personage was fawned upon in arthurs realm and reverently looked up to by everybody even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence and his morals as base as his lineage there were times when he could sit down in the kings presence but i couldnt i could have got a title easily enough and that would have raised me a large step in everybodys eyes even in the kings the giver of it but i didnt ask for it and i declined it when it was offered i couldnt have enjoyed such a thing with my notions and it wouldnt have been fair anyway because as far back as i could go our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister i couldnt have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud and set up over any title except one that should come from the nation itself the only legitimate source and such an one i hoped to win and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor i did win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride this title fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith one day in a village was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth with a laugh and an affirmative vote in ten days it had swept the kingdom and was become as familiar as the kings name i was never known by any other designation afterward whether in the nations talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the council board of the sovereign this title translated into modern speech would be the boss elected by the nation that suited me and it was a pretty high title there were very few thes and i was one of them if you spoke of the duke or the earl or the bishop how could anybody tell which one you meant but if you spoke of the king or the queen or the boss it was different well i liked the king and as king i respected him respected the office at least respected it as much as i was capable of respecting any unearned supremacy but as men i looked down upon him and his nobles privately and he and they liked me and respected my office but as an animal without birth or sham title they looked down upon me and were not particularly private about it either i didnt charge for my opinion about them and they didnt charge for their opinion about me the account was square the books balanced everybody was satisfied chapter ix the tournament they were always having grand tournaments there at camelot and very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull fights they were too but just a little wearisome to the practical mind however i was generally on hand for two reasons a man must not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his community have at heart if he would be liked especially as a statesman and both as business man and statesman i wanted to study the tournament and see if i couldnt invent an improvement on it that reminds me to remark in passing that the very first official thing i did in my administration and it was on the very first day of it too was to start a patent office for i knew that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab and couldnt travel any way but sideways or backways things ran along a tournament nearly every week and now and then the boys used to want me to take a hand i mean sir launcelot and the rest but i said i would by and by no hurry yet and too much government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a going we had one tournament which was continued from day to day during more than a week and as many as five hundred knights took part in it from first to last they were weeks gathering they came on horseback from everywhere from the very ends of the country and even from beyond the sea and many brought ladies and all brought squires and troops of servants it was a most gaudy and gorgeous crowd as to costumery and very characteristic of the country and the time in the way of high animal spirits innocent indecencies of language and happy hearted indifference to morals it was fight or look on all day and every day and sing gamble dance carouse half the night every night they had a most noble good time you never saw such people those banks of beautiful ladies shining in their barbaric splendors would see a knight sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting and instead of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a better view only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief and look ostentatiously broken hearted and then you could lay two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was afraid the public hadnt found it out the noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily but i didnt mind it in the present circumstances because it kept me from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the days cripples they ruined an uncommon good old cross cut saw for me and broke the saw buck too but i let it pass and as for my axe well i made up my mind that the next time i lent an axe to a surgeon i would pick my century i not only watched this tournament from day to day but detailed an intelligent priest from my department of public morals and agriculture and ordered him to report it for it was my purpose by and by when i should have gotten the people along far enough to start a newspaper the first thing you want in a new country is a patent office then work up your school system and after that out with your paper a newspaper has its faults and plenty of them but no matter its hark from the tomb for a dead nation and dont you forget it you cant resurrect a dead nation without it there isnt any way so i wanted to sample things and be finding out what sort of reporter material i might be able to rake together out of the sixth century when i should come to need it well the priest did very well considering he got in all the details and that is a good thing in a local item you see he had kept books for the undertaker department of his church when he was younger and there you know the moneys in the details the more details the more swag bearers mutes candles prayers everything counts and if the bereaved dont buy prayers enough you mark up your candles with a forked pencil and your bill shows up all right and he had a good knack at getting in the complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely to advertise no i mean a knight that had influence and he also had a neat gift of exaggeration for in his time he had kept door for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles of course this novices report lacked whoop and crash and lurid description and therefore wanted the true ring but its antique wording was quaint and sweet and simple and full of the fragrances and flavors of the time and these little merits made up in a measure for its more important lacks here is an extract from it then sir brian de les isles and grummore grummorsum knights of the castle encountered with sir aglovale and sir tor and sir tor smote down sir grummore grummorsum to the earth then came sir carados of the dolorous tower and sir turquine knights of the castle and there encountered with them sir percivale de galis and sir lamorak de galis that were two brethren and there encountered sir percivale with sir carados and either brake their spears unto their hands and then sir turquine with sir lamorak and either of them smote down other horse and all to the earth and either parties rescued other and horsed them again and sir arnold and sir gauter knights of the castle encountered with sir brandiles and sir kay and these four knights encountered mightily and brake their spears to their hands then came sir pertolope from the castle and there encountered with him sir lionel and there sir pertolope the green knight smote down sir lionel brother to sir launcelot all this was marked by noble heralds who bare him best and their names then sir bleobaris brake his spear upon sir gareth but of that stroke sir bleobaris fell to the earth when sir galihodin saw that he bad sir gareth keep him and sir gareth smote him to the earth then sir galihud gat a spear to avenge his brother and in the same wise sir gareth served him and sir dinadan and his brother la cote male taile and sir sagramore le disirous and sir dodinas le savage all these he bare down with one spear when king aswisance of ireland saw sir gareth fare so he marvelled what he might be that one time seemed green and another time at his again coming he seemed blue and thus at every course that he rode to and fro he changed his color so that there might neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him then sir agwisance the king of ireland encountered with sir gareth and there sir gareth smote him from his horse saddle and all and then came king carados of scotland and sir gareth smote him down horse and man and in the same wise he served king uriens of the land of gore and then there came in sir bagdemagus and sir gareth smote him down horse and man to the earth and bagdemaguss son meliganus brake a spear upon sir gareth mightily and knightly and then sir galahault the noble prince cried on high knight with the many colors well hast thou justed now make thee ready that i may just with thee sir gareth heard him and he gat a great spear and so they encountered together and there the prince brake his spear but sir gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm that he reeled here and there and he had fallen down had not his men recovered him truly said king arthur that knight with the many colors is a good knight wherefore the king called unto him sir launcelot and prayed him to encounter with that knight sir said launcelot i may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at this time for he hath had travail enough this day and when a good knight doth so well upon some day it is no good knights part to let him of his worship and namely when he seeth a knight hath done so great labour for peradventure said sir launcelot his quarrel is here this day and peradventure he is best beloved with this lady of all that be here for i see well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great deeds and therefore said sir launcelot as for me this day he shall have the honour though it lay in my power to put him from it i would not there was an unpleasant little episode that day which for reasons of state i struck out of my priests report you will have noticed that garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement when i say garry i mean sir gareth garry was my private pet name for him it suggests that i had a deep affection for him and that was the case but it was a private pet name only and never spoken aloud to any one much less to him being a noble he would not have endured a familiarity like that from me well to proceed i sat in the private box set apart for me as the kings minister while sir dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists he came in there and sat down and began to talk for he was always making up to me because i was a stranger and he liked to have a fresh market for his jokes the most of them having reached that stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while the other person looks sick i had always responded to his efforts as well as i could and felt a very deep and real kindness for him too for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one particular anecdote which i had heard oftenest and had most hated and most loathed all my life he had at least spared it me it was one which i had heard attributed to every humorous person who had ever stood on american soil from columbus down to artemus ward it was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh and then when he was leaving some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever heard and it was all they could do to keep from laughin right out in meetin that anecdote never saw the day that it was worth the telling and yet i had sat under the telling of it hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times and cried and cursed all the way through then who can hope to know what my feelings were to hear this armor plated ass start in on it again in the murky twilight of tradition before the dawn of history while even lactantius might be referred to as the late lactantius and the crusades wouldnt be born for five hundred years yet just as he finished the call boy came so haw hawing like a demon he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of loose castings and i knew nothing more it was some minutes before i came to and then i opened my eyes just in time to see sir gareth fetch him an awful welt and i unconsciously out with the prayer i hope to gracious hes killed but by ill luck before i had got half through with the words sir gareth crashed into sir sagramor le desirous and sent him thundering over his horses crupper and sir sagramor caught my remark and thought i meant it for him well whenever one of those people got a thing into his head there was no getting it out again i knew that so i saved my breath and offered no explanations as soon as sir sagramor got well he notified me that there was a little account to settle between us and he named a day three or four years in the future place of settlement the lists where the offense had been given i said i would be ready when he got back you see he was going for the holy grail the boys all took a flier at the holy grail now and then it was a several years cruise they always put in the long absence snooping around in the most conscientious way though none of them had any idea where the holy grail really was and i dont think any of them actually expected to find it or would have known what to do with it if he had run across it you see it was just the northwest passage of that day as you may say that was all every year expeditions went out holy grailing and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for them there was worlds of reputation in it but no money why they actually wanted me to put in well i should smile chapter x beginnings of civilization the round table soon heard of the challenge and of course it was a good deal discussed for such things interested the boys the king thought i ought now to set forth in quest of adventures so that i might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet sir sagramor when the several years should have rolled away i excused myself for the present i said it would take me three or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly then i should be ready all the chances were that at the end of that time sir sagramor would still be out grailing so no valuable time would be lost by the postponement i should then have been in office six or seven years and i believed my system and machinery would be so well developed that i could take a holiday without its working any harm i was pretty well satisfied with what i had already accomplished in various quiet nooks and corners i had the beginnings of all sorts of industries under way nuclei of future vast factories the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization in these were gathered together the brightest young minds i could find and i kept agents out raking the country for more all the time i was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts experts in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling these nurseries of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their obscure country retreats for nobody was allowed to come into their precincts without a special permit for i was afraid of the church i had started a teacher factory and a lot of sunday schools the first thing as a result i now had an admirable system of graded schools in full blast in those places and also a complete variety of protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing condition everybody could be any kind of a christian he wanted to there was perfect freedom in that matter but i confined public religious teaching to the churches and the sunday schools permitting nothing of it in my other educational buildings i could have given my own sect the preference and made everybody a presbyterian without any trouble but that would have been to affront a law of human nature spiritual wants and instincts are as various in the human family as are physical appetites complexions and features and a man is only at his best morally when he is equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion angularities and stature of the individual who wears it and besides i was afraid of a united church it makes a mighty power the mightiest conceivable and then when it by and by gets into selfish hands as it is always bound to do it means death to human liberty and paralysis to human thought all mines were royal property and there were a good many of them they had formerly been worked as savages always work mines holes grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by hand at the rate of a ton a day but i had begun to put the mining on a scientific basis as early as i could yes i had made pretty handsome progress when sir sagramors challenge struck me four years rolled by and then well you would never imagine it in the world unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in safe hands the despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government an earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government if the conditions were the same namely the despot the perfectest individual of the human race and his lease of life perpetual but as a perishable perfect man must die and leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government it is the worst form that is possible my works showed what a despot could do with the resources of a kingdom at his command unsuspected by this dark land i had the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very nose it was fenced away from the public view but there it was a gigantic and unassailable fact and to be heard from yet if i lived and had luck there it was as sure a fact and as substantial a fact as any serene volcano standing innocent with its smokeless summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its bowels my schools and churches were children four years before they were grown up now my shops of that day were vast factories now where i had a dozen trained men then i had a thousand now where i had one brilliant expert then i had fifty now i stood with my hand on the cock so to speak ready to turn it on and flood the midnight world with light at any moment but i was not going to do the thing in that sudden way it was not my policy the people could not have stood it and moreover i should have had the established roman catholic church on my back in a minute no i had been going cautiously all the while i had had confidential agents trickling through the country some time whose office was to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees and to gnaw a little at this and that and the other superstition and so prepare the way gradually for a better order of things i was turning on my light one candle power at a time and meant to continue to do so i had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom and they were doing very well i meant to work this racket more and more as time wore on if nothing occurred to frighten me one of my deepest secrets was my west point my military academy i kept that most jealously out of sight and i did the same with my naval academy which i had established at a remote seaport both were prospering to my satisfaction clarence was twenty two now and was my head executive my right hand he was a darling he was equal to anything there wasnt anything he couldnt turn his hand to of late i had been training him for journalism for the time seemed about right for a start in the newspaper line nothing big but just a small weekly for experimental circulation in my civilization nurseries he took to it like a duck there was an editor concealed in him sure already he had doubled himself in one way he talked sixth century and wrote nineteenth his journalistic style was climbing steadily it was already up to the back settlement alabama mark and couldnt be told from the editorial output of that region either by matter or flavor we had another large departure on hand too this was a telegraph and a telephone our first venture in this line these wires were for private service only as yet and must be kept private until a riper day should come we had a gang of men on the road working mainly by night they were stringing ground wires we were afraid to put up poles for they would attract too much inquiry ground wires were good enough in both instances for my wires were protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect my men had orders to strike across country avoiding roads and establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights betrayed their presence and leaving experts in charge nobody could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom for nobody ever went intentionally to any place but only struck it by accident in his wanderings and then generally left it without thinking to inquire what its name was at one time and another we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the kingdom but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble so we had given the thing up for the present it would be poor wisdom to antagonize the church as for the general condition of the country it was as it had been when i arrived in it to all intents and purposes i had made changes but they were necessarily slight and they were not noticeable thus far i had not even meddled with taxation outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues i had systematized those and put the service on an effective and righteous basis as a result these revenues were already quadrupled and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than before that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief and the praises of my administration were hearty and general personally i struck an interruption now but i did not mind it it could not have happened at a better time earlier it could have annoyed me but now everything was in good hands and swimming right along the king had reminded me several times of late that the postponement i had asked for four years before had about run out now it was a hint that i ought to be starting out to seek adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy of the honor of breaking a lance with sir sagramor who was still out grailing but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions and might be found any year now so you see i was expecting this interruption it did not take me by surprise chapter xi the yankee in search of adventures there never was such a country for wandering liars and they were of both sexes hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some far away castle where she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel usually a giant now you would think that the first thing the king would do after listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger would be to ask for credentials yes and a pointer or two as to locality of castle best route to it and so on but nobody ever thought of so simple and common sense a thing at that no everybody swallowed these peoples lies whole and never asked a question of any sort or about anything well one day when i was not around one of these people came along it was a she one this time and told a tale of the usual pattern her mistress was a captive in a vast and gloomy castle along with forty four other young and beautiful girls pretty much all of them princesses they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty six years the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers each with four arms and one eye the eye in the center of the forehead and as big as a fruit sort of fruit not mentioned their usual slovenliness in statistics would you believe it the king and the whole round table were in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure every knight of the table jumped for the chance and begged for it but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me who had not asked for it at all by an effort i contained my joy when clarence brought me the news but he he could not contain his his mouth gushed delight and gratitude in a steady discharge delight in my good fortune gratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me he could keep neither his legs nor his body still but pirouetted about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness on my side i could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon me this benefaction but i kept my vexation under the surface for policys sake and did what i could to let on to be glad indeed i said i was glad and in a way it was true i was as glad as a person is when he is scalped well one must make the best of things and not waste time with useless fretting but get down to business and see what can be done in all lies there is wheat among the chaff i must get at the wheat in this case so i sent for the girl and she came she was a comely enough creature and soft and modest but if signs went for anything she didnt know as much as a ladys watch i said my dear have you been questioned as to particulars she said she hadnt well i didnt expect you had but i thought i would ask to make sure its the way i ve been raised now you mustnt take it unkindly if i remind you that as we dont know you we must go a little slow you may be all right of course and we ll hope that you are but to take it for granted isnt business you understand that im obliged to ask you a few questions just answer up fair and square and dont be afraid where do you live when you are at home in the land of moder fair sir land of moder i dont remember hearing of it before parents living as to that i know not if they be yet on live sith it is many years that i have lain shut up in the castle your name please i hight the demoiselle alisande la carteloise an it please you do you know anybody here who can identify you that were not likely fair lord i being come hither now for the first time have you brought any letters any documents any proofs that you are trustworthy and truthful of a surety no and wherefore should i have i not a tongue and cannot i say all that myself but your saying it you know and somebody elses saying it is different different how might that be i fear me i do not understand dont understand land of why you see you see why great scott cant you understand a little thing like that cant you understand the difference between your why do you look so innocent and idiotic i in truth i know not but an it were the will of god yes yes i reckon thats about the size of it dont mind my seeming excited im not let us change the subject now as to this castle with forty five princesses in it and three ogres at the head of it tell me where is this harem harem the castle you understand where is the castle oh as to that it is great and strong and well beseen and lieth in a far country yes it is many leagues how many ah fair sir it were woundily hard to tell they are so many and do so lap the one upon the other and being made all in the same image and tincted with the same color one may not know the one league from its fellow nor how to count them except they be taken apart and ye wit well it were gods work to do that being not within mans capacity for ye will note hold on hold on never mind about the distance whereabouts does the castle lie whats the direction from here ah please you sir it hath no direction from here by reason that the road lieth not straight but turneth evermore wherefore the direction of its place abideth not but is some time under the one sky and anon under another whereso if ye be minded that it is in the east and wend thitherward ye shall observe that the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space of half a circle and this marvel happing again and yet again and still again it will grieve you that you had thought by vanities of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the will of him that giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it pleaseth him and if it please him not will the rather that even all castles and all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth leaving the places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant so warning his creatures that where he will he will and where he will not he oh thats all right thats all right give us a rest never mind about the direction hang the direction i beg pardon i beg a thousand pardons i am not well to day pay no attention when i soliloquize it is an old habit an old bad habit and hard to get rid of when ones digestion is all disordered with eating food that was raised forever and ever before he was born good land a man cant keep his functions regular on spring chickens thirteen hundred years old but come never mind about that lets have you got such a thing as a map of that region about you now a good map is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers have brought from over the great seas which being boiled in oil and an onion and salt added thereto doth what a map what are you talking about dont you know what a map is there there never mind dont explain i hate explanations they fog a thing up so that you cant tell anything about it run along dear good day show her the way clarence oh well it was reasonably plain now why these donkeys didnt prospect these liars for details it may be that this girl had a fact in her somewhere but i dont believe you could have sluiced it out with a hydraulic nor got it with the earlier forms of blasting even it was a case for dynamite why she was a perfect ass and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if she had been a leaf out of the gospel it kind of sizes up the whole party and think of the simple ways of this court this wandering wench hadnt any more trouble to get access to the king in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse in my day and country in fact he was glad to see her glad to hear her tale with that adventure of hers to offer she was as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner just as i was ending up these reflections clarence came back i remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl hadnt got hold of a single point that could help me to find the castle the youth looked a little surprised or puzzled or something and intimated that he had been wondering to himself what i had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for why great guns i said dont i want to find the castle and how else would i go about it la sweet your worship one may lightly answer that i ween she will go with thee they always do she will ride with thee ride with me nonsense but of a truth she will she will ride with thee thou shalt see what she browse around the hills and scour the woods with me alone and i as good as engaged to be married why its scandalous think how it would look my the dear face that rose before me the boy was eager to know all about this tender matter i swore him to secrecy and then whispered her name puss flanagan he looked disappointed and said he didnt remember the countess how natural it was for the little courtier to give her a rank he asked me where she lived in east har i came to myself and stopped a little confused then i said never mind now i ll tell you some time and might he see her would i let him see her some day it was but a little thing to promise thirteen hundred years or so and he so eager so i said yes but i sighed i couldnt help it and yet there was no sense in sighing for she wasnt born yet but that is the way we are made we dont reason where we feel we just feel my expedition was all the talk that day and that night and the boys were very good to me and made much of me and seemed to have forgotten their vexation and disappointment and come to be as anxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins loose as if it were themselves that had the contract well they were good children but just children that is all and they gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants and how to scoop them in and they told me all sorts of charms against enchantments and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my wounds but it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if i was such a wonderful necromancer as i was pretending to be i ought not to need salves or instructions or charms against enchantments and least of all arms and armor on a foray of any kind even against fire spouting dragons and devils hot from perdition let alone such poor adversaries as these i was after these commonplace ogres of the back settlements i was to have an early breakfast and start at dawn for that was the usual way but i had the demons own time with my armor and this delayed me a little it is troublesome to get into and there is so much detail first you wrap a layer or two of blanket around your body for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold iron then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail these are made of small steel links woven together and they form a fabric so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor it slumps into a pile like a peck of wet fish net it is very heavy and is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night shirt yet plenty used it for that tax collectors and reformers and one horse kings with a defective title and those sorts of people then you put on your shoes flat boats roofed over with interleaving bands of steel and screw your clumsy spurs into the heels next you buckle your greaves on your legs and your cuisses on your thighs then come your backplate and your breastplate and you begin to feel crowded then you hitch onto the breastplate the half petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down and isnt any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle either for looks or for wear or to wipe your hands on next you belt on your sword then you put your stove pipe joints onto your arms your iron gauntlets onto your hands your iron rat trap onto your head with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back of your neck and there you are snug as a candle in a candle mould this is no time to dance well a man that is packed away like that is a nut that isnt worth the cracking there is so little of the meat when you get down to it by comparison with the shell the boys helped me or i never could have got in just as we finished sir bedivere happened in and i saw that as like as not i hadnt chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip how stately he looked and tall and broad and grand he had on his head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears and for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his upper lip and protected his nose and all the rest of him from neck to heel was flexible chain mail trousers and all but pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment which of course was of chain mail as i said and hung straight from his shoulders to his ankles and from his middle to the bottom both before and behind was divided so that he could ride and let the skirts hang down on each side he was going grailing and it was just the outfit for it too i would have given a good deal for that ulster but it was too late now to be fooling around the sun was just up the king and the court were all on hand to see me off and wish me luck so it wouldnt be etiquette for me to tarry you dont get on your horse yourself no if you tried it you would get disappointed they carry you out just as they carry a sun struck man to the drug store and put you on and help get you to rights and fix your feet in the stirrups and all the while you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else like somebody that has been married on a sudden or struck by lightning or something like that and hasnt quite fetched around yet and is sort of numb and cant just get his bearings then they stood up the mast they called a spear in its socket by my left foot and i gripped it with my hand lastly they hung my shield around my neck and i was all complete and ready to up anchor and get to sea everybody was as good to me as they could be and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup cup her own self there was nothing more to do now but for that damsel to get up behind me on a pillion which she did and put an arm or so around me to hold on and so we started and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their handkerchiefs or helmets and everybody we met going down the hill and through the village was respectful to us except some shabby little boys on the outskirts they said oh what a guy and hove clods at us in my experience boys are the same in all ages they dont respect anything they dont care for anything or anybody they say go up baldhead to the prophet going his unoffending way in the gray of antiquity they sass me in the holy gloom of the middle ages and i had seen them act the same way in buchanans administration i remember because i was there and helped the prophet had his bears and settled with his boys and i wanted to get down and settle with mine but it wouldnt answer because i couldnt have got up again i hate a country without a derrick chapter xii slow torture straight off we were in the country it was most lovely and pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning in the first freshness of autumn from hilltops we saw fair green valleys lying spread out below with streams winding through them and island groves of trees here and there and huge lonely oaks scattered about and casting black blots of shade and beyond the valleys we saw the ranges of hills blue with haze stretching away in billowy perspective to the horizon with at wide intervals a dim fleck of white or gray on a wave summit which we knew was a castle we crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew and we moved like spirits the cushioned turf giving out no sound of footfall we dreamed along through glades in a mist of green light that got its tint from the sun drenched roof of leaves overhead and by our feet the clearest and coldest of runlets went frisking and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort of whispering music comfortable to hear and at times we left the world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and rich gloom of the forest where furtive wild things whisked and scurried by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the place where the noise was and where only the earliest birds were turning out and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonder and a mysterious far off hammering and drumming for worms on a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable remotenesses of the woods and by and by out we would swing again into the glare about the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into the glare it was along there somewhere a couple of hours or so after sun up it wasnt as pleasant as it had been it was beginning to get hot this was quite noticeable we had a very long pull after that without any shade now it is curious how progressively little frets grow and multiply after they once get a start things which i didnt mind at all at first i began to mind now and more and more too all the time the first ten or fifteen times i wanted my handkerchief i didnt seem to care i got along and said never mind it isnt any matter and dropped it out of my mind but now it was different i wanted it all the time it was nag nag nag right along and no rest i couldnt get it out of my mind and so at last i lost my temper and said hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets in it you see i had my handkerchief in my helmet and some other things but it was that kind of a helmet that you cant take off by yourself that hadnt occurred to me when i put it there and in fact i didnt know it i supposed it would be particularly convenient there and so now the thought of its being there so handy and close by and yet not get at able made it all the worse and the harder to bear yes the thing that you cant get is the thing that you want mainly every one has noticed that well it took my mind off from everything else took it clear off and centered it in my helmet and mile after mile there it stayed imagining the handkerchief picturing the handkerchief and it was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling down into my eyes and i couldnt get at it it seems like a little thing on paper but it was not a little thing at all it was the most real kind of misery i would not say it if it was not so i made up my mind that i would carry along a reticule next time let it look how it might and people say what they would of course these iron dudes of the round table would think it was scandalous and maybe raise sheol about it but as for me give me comfort first and style afterwards so we jogged along and now and then we struck a stretch of dust and it would tumble up in clouds and get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry and of course i said things i oughtnt to have said i dont deny that i am not better than others we couldnt seem to meet anybody in this lonesome britain not even an ogre and in the mood i was in then it was well for the ogre that is an ogre with a handkerchief most knights would have thought of nothing but getting his armor but so i got his bandanna he could keep his hardware for all of me meantime it was getting hotter and hotter in there you see the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and more all the time well when you are hot that way every little thing irritates you when i trotted i rattled like a crate of dishes and that annoyed me and moreover i couldnt seem to stand that shield slatting and banging now about my breast now around my back and if i dropped into a walk my joints creaked and screeched in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does and as we didnt create any breeze at that gait i was like to get fried in that stove and besides the quieter you went the heavier the iron settled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh every minute and you had to be always changing hands and passing your spear over to the other foot it got so irksome for one hand to hold it long at a time well you know when you perspire that way in rivers there comes a time when you when you well when you itch you are inside your hands are outside so there you are nothing but iron between it is not a light thing let it sound as it may first it is one place then another then some more and it goes on spreading and spreading and at last the territory is all occupied and nobody can imagine what you feel like nor how unpleasant it is and when it had got to the worst and it seemed to me that i could not stand anything more a fly got in through the bars and settled on my nose and the bars were stuck and wouldnt work and i couldnt get the visor up and i could only shake my head which was baking hot by this time and the fly well you know how a fly acts when he has got a certainty he only minded the shaking enough to change from nose to lip and lip to ear and buzz and buzz all around in there and keep on lighting and biting in a way that a person already so distressed as i was simply could not stand so i gave in and got alisande to unship the helmet and relieve me of it then she emptied the conveniences out of it and fetched it full of water and i drank and then stood up and she poured the rest down inside the armor one cannot think how refreshing it was she continued to fetch and pour until i was well soaked and thoroughly comfortable it was good to have a rest and peace but nothing is quite perfect in this life at any time i had made a pipe a while back and also some pretty fair tobacco not the real thing but what some of the indians use the inside bark of the willow dried these comforts had been in the helmet and now i had them again but no matches gradually as the time wore along one annoying fact was borne in upon my understanding that we were weather bound an armed novice cannot mount his horse without help and plenty of it sandy was not enough not enough for me anyway we had to wait until somebody should come along waiting in silence would have been agreeable enough for i was full of matter for reflection and wanted to give it a chance to work i wanted to try and think out how it was that rational or even half rational men could ever have learned to wear armor considering its inconveniences and how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations when it was plain that what i had suffered to day they had had to suffer all the days of their lives i wanted to think that out and moreover i wanted to think out some way to reform this evil and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out but thinking was out of the question in the circumstances you couldnt think where sandy was she was a quite biddable creature and good hearted but she had a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill and made your head sore like the drays and wagons in a city if she had had a cork she would have been a comfort but you cant cork that kind they would die her clack was going all day and you would think something would surely happen to her works by and by but no they never got out of order and she never had to slack up for words she could grind and pump and churn and buzz by the week and never stop to oil up or blow out and yet the result was just nothing but wind she never had any ideas any more than a fog has she was a perfect blatherskite i mean for jaw jaw jaw talk talk talk jabber jabber jabber but just as good as she could be i hadnt minded her mill that morning on account of having that hornets nest of other troubles but more than once in the afternoon i had to say take a rest child the way you are using up all the domestic air the kingdom will have to go to importing it by to morrow and its a low enough treasury without that chapter xiii freemen yes it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be contented only a little while back when i was riding and suffering what a heaven this peace this rest this sweet serenity in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have seemed where i could keep perfectly comfortable all the time by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then yet already i was getting dissatisfied partly because i could not light my pipe for although i had long ago started a match factory i had forgotten to bring matches with me and partly because we had nothing to eat here was another illustration of the childlike improvidence of this age and people a man in armor always trusted to chance for his food on a journey and would have been scandalized at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear there was probably not a knight of all the round table combination who would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing as that on his flagstaff and yet there could not be anything more sensible it had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches into my helmet but i was interrupted in the act and had to make an excuse and lay them aside and a dog got them night approached and with it a storm the darkness came on fast we must camp of course i found a good shelter for the demoiselle under a rock and went off and found another for myself but i was obliged to remain in my armor because i could not get it off by myself and yet could not allow alisande to help because it would have seemed so like undressing before folk it would not have amounted to that in reality because i had clothes on underneath but the prejudices of ones breeding are not gotten rid of just at a jump and i knew that when it came to stripping off that bob tailed iron petticoat i should be embarrassed with the storm came a change of weather and the stronger the wind blew and the wilder the rain lashed around the colder and colder it got pretty soon various kinds of bugs and ants and worms and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside my armor to get warm and while some of them behaved well enough and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet the majority were of a restless uncomfortable sort and never stayed still but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what especially the ants which went tickling along in wearisome procession from one end of me to the other by the hour and are a kind of creatures which i never wish to sleep with again it would be my advice to persons situated in this way to not roll or thrash around because this excites the interest of all the different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want to turn out and see what is going on and this makes things worse than they were before and of course makes you objurgate harder too if you can still if one did not roll and thrash around he would die so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other there is no real choice even after i was frozen solid i could still distinguish that tickling just as a corpse does when he is taking electric treatment i said i would never wear armor after this trip all those trying hours whilst i was frozen and yet was in a living fire as you may say on account of that swarm of crawlers that same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my tired head how do people stand this miserable armor how have they managed to stand it all these generations how can they sleep at night for dreading the tortures of next day when the morning came at last i was in a bad enough plight seedy drowsy fagged from want of sleep weary from thrashing around famished from long fasting pining for a bath and to get rid of the animals and crippled with rheumatism and how had it fared with the nobly born the titled aristocrat the demoiselle alisande la carteloise why she was as fresh as a squirrel she had slept like the dead and as for a bath probably neither she nor any other noble in the land had ever had one and so she was not missing it measured by modern standards they were merely modified savages those people this noble lady showed no impatience to get to breakfast and that smacks of the savage too on their journeys those britons were used to long fasts and knew how to bear them and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting after the style of the indian and the anaconda as like as not sandy was loaded for a three day stretch we were off before sunrise sandy riding and i limping along behind in half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded as a road they were as humble as animals to me and when i proposed to breakfast with them they were so flattered so overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that at first they were not able to believe that i was in earnest my lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side she said in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the other cattle a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely because it referred to them and not because it insulted or offended them for it didnt and yet they were not slaves not chattels by a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen seven tenths of the free population of the country were of just their class and degree small independent farmers artisans etc which is to say they were the nation the actual nation they were about all of it that was useful or worth saving or really respect worthy and to subtract them would have been to subtract the nation and leave behind some dregs some refuse in the shape of a king nobility and gentry idle unproductive acquainted mainly with the arts of wasting and destroying and of no sort of use or value in any rationally constructed world and yet by ingenious contrivance this gilded minority instead of being in the tail of the procession where it belonged was marching head up and banners flying at the other end of it had elected itself to be the nation and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long that they had come at last to accept it as a truth and not only that but to believe it right and as it should be the priests had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state of things was ordained of god and so not reflecting upon how unlike god it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms and especially such poor transparent ones as this they had dropped the matter there and become respectfully quiet the talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in a formerly american ear they were freemen but they could not leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his permission they could not prepare their own bread but must have their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his bakery and pay roundly for the same they could not sell a piece of their own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the proceeds nor buy a piece of somebody elses without remembering him in cash for the privilege they had to harvest his grain for him gratis and be ready to come at a moments notice leaving their own crop to destruction by the threatened storm they had to let him plant fruit trees in their fields and then keep their indignation to themselves when his heedless fruit gatherers trampled the grain around the trees they had to smother their anger when his hunting parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of their patient toil they were not allowed to keep doves themselves and when the swarms from my lords dovecote settled on their crops they must not lose their temper and kill a bird for awful would the penalty be when the harvest was at last gathered then came the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it first the church carted off its fat tenth then the kings commissioner took his twentieth then my lords people made a mighty inroad upon the remainder after which the skinned freeman had liberty to bestow the remnant in his barn in case it was worth the trouble there were taxes and taxes and taxes and more taxes and taxes again and yet other taxes upon this free and independent pauper but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop none upon the wasteful nobility or the all devouring church if the baron would sleep unvexed the freeman must sit up all night after his days work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet if the freemans daughter but no that last infamy of monarchical government is unprintable and finally if the freeman grown desperate with his tortures found his life unendurable under such conditions and sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge the gentle church condemned him to eternal fire the gentle law buried him at midnight at the cross roads with a stake through his back and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors and here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work on their lord the bishops road three days each gratis every head of a family and every son of a family three days each gratis and a day or so added for their servants why it was like reading about france and the french before the ever memorable and blessed revolution which swept a thousand years of such villany away in one swift tidal wave of blood one a settlement of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell there were two reigns of terror if we would but remember it and consider it the one wrought murder in hot passion the other in heartless cold blood the one lasted mere months the other had lasted a thousand years the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons the other upon a hundred millions but our shudders are all for the horrors of the minor terror the momentary terror so to speak whereas what is the horror of swift death by the axe compared with lifelong death from hunger cold insult cruelty and heart break what is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake a city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over but all france could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real terror that unspeakably bitter and awful terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves these poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast and their talk with me were as full of humble reverence for their king and church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire there was something pitifully ludicrous about it i asked them if they supposed a nation of people ever existed who with a free vote in every mans hand would elect that a single family and its descendants should reign over it forever whether gifted or boobies to the exclusion of all other families including the voters and would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised to dizzy summits of rank and clothed on with offensive transmissible glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the nations families including his own they all looked unhit and said they didnt know that they had never thought about it before and it hadnt ever occurred to them that a nation could be so situated that every man could have a say in the government i said i had seen one and that it would last until it had an established church again they were all unhit at first but presently one man looked up and asked me to state that proposition again and state it slowly so it could soak into his understanding i did it and after a little he had the idea and he brought his fist down and said he didnt believe a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down in the mud and dirt in any such way and that to steal from a nation its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes i said to myself this ones a man if i were backed by enough of his sort i would make a strike for the welfare of this country and try to prove myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in its system of government you see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its office holders the country is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing it is the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to institutions are extraneous they are its mere clothing and clothing can wear out become ragged cease to be comfortable cease to protect the body from winter disease and death to be loyal to rags to shout for rags to worship rags to die for rags that is a loyalty of unreason it is pure animal it belongs to monarchy was invented by monarchy let monarchy keep it i was from connecticut whose constitution declares that all political power is inherent in the people and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit and that they have at all times an undeniable and indefeasible right to alter their form of government in such a manner as they may think expedient under that gospel the citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealths political clothes are worn out and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit is disloyal he is a traitor that he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay does not excuse him it is his duty to agitate anyway and it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see the matter as he does and now here i was in a country where a right to say how the country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each thousand of its population for the nine hundred and ninety four to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose to change it would have made the whole six shudder as one man it would have been so disloyal so dishonorable such putrid black treason so to speak i was become a stockholder in a corporation where nine hundred and ninety four of the members furnished all the money and did all the work and the other six elected themselves a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends it seemed to me that what the nine hundred and ninety four dupes needed was a new deal the thing that would have best suited the circus side of my nature would have been to resign the boss ship and get up an insurrection and turn it into a revolution but i knew that the jack cade or the wat tyler who tries such a thing without first educating his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely certain to get left i had never been accustomed to getting left even if i do say it myself wherefore the deal which had been for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different pattern from the cade tyler sort so i did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human sheep but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him after i had finished i got him to lend me a little ink from his veins and with this and a sliver i wrote on a piece of bark put him in the man factory and gave it to him and said take it to the palace at camelot and give it into the hands of amyas le poulet whom i call clarence and he will understand he is a priest then said the man and some of the enthusiasm went out of his face how a priest didnt i tell you that no chattel of the church no bond slave of pope or bishop can enter my man factory didnt i tell you that you couldnt enter unless your religion whatever it might be was your own free property marry it is so and for that i was glad wherefore it liked me not and bred in me a cold doubt to hear of this priest being there but he isnt a priest i tell you the man looked far from satisfied he said he is not a priest and yet can read he is not a priest and yet can read yes and write too for that matter i taught him myself the mans face cleared and it is the first thing that you yourself will be taught in that factory i i would give blood out of my heart to know that art why i will be your slave your no you wont you wont be anybodys slave take your family and go along your lord the bishop will confiscate your small property but no matter clarence will fix you all right chapter xiv defend thee lord i paid three pennies for my breakfast and a most extravagant price it was too seeing that one could have breakfasted a dozen persons for that money but i was feeling good by this time and i had always been a kind of spendthrift anyway and then these people had wanted to give me the food for nothing scant as their provision was and so it was a grateful pleasure to emphasize my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a good big financial lift where the money would do so much more good than it would in my helmet where these pennies being made of iron and not stinted in weight my half dollars worth was a good deal of a burden to me i spent money rather too freely in those days it is true but one reason for it was that i hadnt got the proportions of things entirely adjusted even yet after so long a sojourn in britain hadnt got along to where i was able to absolutely realize that a penny in arthurs land and a couple of dollars in connecticut were about one and the same thing just twins as you may say in purchasing power if my start from camelot could have been delayed a very few days i could have paid these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint and that would have pleased me and them too not less i had adopted the american values exclusively in a week or two now cents nickels dimes quarters and half dollars and also a trifle of gold would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through the commercial veins of the kingdom and i looked to see this new blood freshen up its life the farmers were bound to throw in something to sort of offset my liberality whether i would or no so i let them give me a flint and steel and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed sandy and me on our horse i lit my pipe when the first blast of smoke shot out through the bars of my helmet all those people broke for the woods and sandy went over backwards and struck the ground with a dull thud they thought i was one of those fire belching dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other professional liars i had infinite trouble to persuade those people to venture back within explaining distance then i told them that this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none but my enemies and i promised with my hand on my heart that if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass before me they should see that only those who remained behind would be struck dead the procession moved with a good deal of promptness there were no casualties to report for nobody had curiosity enough to remain behind to see what would happen i lost some time now for these big children their fears gone became so ravished with wonder over my awe compelling fireworks that i had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before they would let me go still the delay was not wholly unproductive for it took all that time to get sandy thoroughly wonted to the new thing she being so close to it you know it plugged up her conversation mill too for a considerable while and that was a gain but above all other benefits accruing i had learned something i was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come along now we tarried with a holy hermit that night and my opportunity came about the middle of the next afternoon we were crossing a vast meadow by way of short cut and i was musing absently hearing nothing seeing nothing when sandy suddenly interrupted a remark which she had begun that morning with the cry defend thee lord peril of life is toward and she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood i looked up and saw far off in the shade of a tree half a dozen armed knights and their squires and straightway there was bustle among them and tightening of saddle girths for the mount my pipe was ready and would have been lit if i had not been lost in thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging anybody i lit up at once and by the time i had got a good head of reserved steam on here they came all together too none of those chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much about one courtly rascal at a time and the rest standing by to see fair play no they came in a body they came with a whirr and a rush they came like a volley from a battery came with heads low down plumes streaming out behind lances advanced at a level it was a handsome sight a beautiful sight for a man up a tree i laid my lance in rest and waited with my heart beating till the iron wave was just ready to break over me then spouted a column of white smoke through the bars of my helmet you should have seen the wave go to pieces and scatter this was a finer sight than the other one but these people stopped two or three hundred yards away and this troubled me my satisfaction collapsed and fear came i judged i was a lost man but sandy was radiant and was going to be eloquent but i stopped her and told her my magic had miscarried somehow or other and she must mount with all despatch and we must ride for life no she wouldnt she said that my enchantment had disabled those knights they were not riding on because they couldnt wait they would drop out of their saddles presently and we would get their horses and harness i could not deceive such trusting simplicity so i said it was a mistake that when my fireworks killed at all they killed instantly no the men would not die there was something wrong about my apparatus i couldnt tell what but we must hurry and get away for those people would attack us again in a minute sandy laughed and said lack a day sir they be not of that breed sir launcelot will give battle to dragons and will abide by them and will assail them again and yet again and still again until he do conquer and destroy them and so likewise will sir pellinore and sir aglovale and sir carados and mayhap others but there be none else that will venture it let the idle say what the idle will and la as to yonder base rufflers think ye they have not their fill but yet desire more well then what are they waiting for why dont they leave nobodys hindering good land im willing to let bygones be bygones im sure leave is it oh give thyself easement as to that they dream not of it no not they they wait to yield them come really is that sooth as you people say if they want to why dont they it would like them much but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed ye would not hold them blamable they fear to come well then suppose i go to them instead and ah wit ye well they would not abide your coming i will go and she did she was a handy person to have along on a raid i would have considered this a doubtful errand myself i presently saw the knights riding away and sandy coming back that was a relief i judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings i mean in the conversation otherwise the interview wouldnt have been so short but it turned out that she had managed the business well in fact admirably she said that when she told those people i was the boss it hit them where they lived smote them sore with fear and dread was her word and then they were ready to put up with anything she might require so she swore them to appear at arthurs court within two days and yield them with horse and harness and be my knights henceforth and subject to my command how much better she managed that thing than i should have done it myself she was a daisy chapter xv sandys tale and so im proprietor of some knights said i as we rode off who would ever have supposed that i should live to list up assets of that sort i shant know what to do with them unless i raffle them off how many of them are there sandy seven please you sir and their squires it is a good haul who are they where do they hang out where do they hang out yes where do they live ah i understood thee not that will i tell eftsoons then she said musingly and softly turning the words daintily over her tongue hang they out hang they out where hang where do they hang out eh right so where do they hang out of a truth the phrase hath a fair and winsome grace and is prettily worded withal i will repeat it anon and anon in mine idlesse whereby i may peradventure learn it where do they hang out even so already it falleth trippingly from my tongue and forasmuch as dont forget the cowboys sandy cowboys yes the knights you know you were going to tell me about them a while back you remember figuratively speaking games called game yes yes yes go to the bat i mean get to work on your statistics and dont burn so much kindling getting your fire started tell me about the knights i will well and lightly will begin so they two departed and rode into a great forest and great scott you see i recognized my mistake at once i had set her works a going it was my own fault she would be thirty days getting down to those facts and she generally began without a preface and finished without a result if you interrupted her she would either go right along without noticing or answer with a couple of words and go back and say the sentence over again so interruptions only did harm and yet i had to interrupt and interrupt pretty frequently too in order to save my life a person would die if he let her monotony drip on him right along all day great scott i said in my distress she went right back and began over again so they two departed and rode into a great forest and which two sir gawaine and sir uwaine and so they came to an abbey of monks and there were well lodged so on the morn they heard their masses in the abbey and so they rode forth till they came to a great forest then was sir gawaine ware in a valley by a turret of twelve fair damsels and two knights armed on great horses and the damsels went to and fro by a tree and then was sir gawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree and ever as the damsels came by it they spit upon it and some threw mire upon the shield now if i hadnt seen the like myself in this country sandy i wouldnt believe it but i ve seen it and i can just see those creatures now parading before that shield and acting like that the women here do certainly act like all possessed yes and i mean your best too societys very choicest brands the humblest hello girl along ten thousand miles of wire could teach gentleness patience modesty manners to the highest duchess in arthurs land hello girl yes but dont you ask me to explain its a new kind of a girl they dont have them here one often speaks sharply to them when they are not the least in fault and he cant get over feeling sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years its such shabby mean conduct and so unprovoked the fact is no gentleman ever does it though i well i myself if i ve got to confess peradventure she never mind her never mind her i tell you i couldnt ever explain her so you would understand even so be it sith ye are so minded then sir gawaine and sir uwaine went and saluted them and asked them why they did that despite to the shield sirs said the damsels we shall tell you there is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield and he is a passing good man of his hands but he hateth all ladies and gentlewomen and therefore we do all this despite to the shield i will say you said sir gawaine it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen and peradventure though he hate you he hath some cause and peradventure he loveth in some other places ladies and gentlewomen and to be loved again and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of man of prowess yes that is the man to please them sandy man of brains that is a thing they never think of tom sayers john heenan john l sullivan pity but you could be here you would have your legs under the round table and a sir in front of your names within the twenty four hours and you could bring about a new distribution of the married princesses and duchesses of the court in another twenty four the fact is it is just a sort of polished up court of comanches and there isnt a squaw in it who doesnt stand ready at the dropping of a hat to desert to the buck with the biggest string of scalps at his belt and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of said sir gawaine now what is his name sir said they his name is marhaus the kings son of ireland son of the king of ireland you mean the other form doesnt mean anything and look out and hold on tight now we must jump this gully there we are all right now this horse belongs in the circus he is born before his time i know him well said sir uwaine he is a passing good knight as any is on live on live if you ve got a fault in the world sandy it is that you are a shade too archaic but it isnt any matter for i saw him once proved at a justs where many knights were gathered and that time there might no man withstand him ah said sir gawaine damsels methinketh ye are to blame for it is to suppose he that hung that shield there will not be long therefrom and then may those knights match him on horseback and that is more your worship than thus for i will abide no longer to see a knights shield dishonored and therewith sir uwaine and sir gawaine departed a little from them and then were they ware where sir marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward them and when the twelve damsels saw sir marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild so that some of them fell by the way then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield and said on high sir marhaus defend thee and so they ran together that the knight brake his spear on marhaus and sir marhaus smote him so hard that he brake his neck and the horses back well that is just the trouble about this state of things it ruins so many horses that saw the other knight of the turret and dressed him toward marhaus and they went so eagerly together that the knight of the turret was soon smitten down horse and man stark dead another horse gone i tell you it is a custom that ought to be broken up i dont see how people with any feeling can applaud and support it so these two knights came together with great random i saw that i had been asleep and missed a chapter but i didnt say anything i judged that the irish knight was in trouble with the visitors by this time and this turned out to be the case that sir uwaine smote sir marhaus that his spear brast in pieces on the shield and sir marhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth and hurt sir uwaine on the left side the truth is alisande these archaics are a little too simple the vocabulary is too limited and so by consequence descriptions suffer in the matter of variety they run too much to level saharas of fact and not enough to picturesque detail this throws about them a certain air of the monotonous in fact the fights are all alike a couple of people come together with great random random is a good word and so is exegesis for that matter and so is holocaust and defalcation and usufruct and a hundred others but land a body ought to discriminate they come together with great random and a spear is brast and one party brake his shield and the other one goes down horse and man over his horse tail and brake his neck and then the next candidate comes randoming in and brast his spear and the other man brast his shield and down he goes horse and man over his horse tail and brake his neck and then theres another elected and another and another and still another till the material is all used up and when you come to figure up results you cant tell one fight from another nor who whipped and as a picture of living raging roaring battle sho why its pale and noiseless just ghosts scuffling in a fog dear me what would this barren vocabulary get out of the mightiest spectacle the burning of rome in neros time for instance why it would merely say town burned down no insurance boy brast a window fireman brake his neck why that aint a picture it was a good deal of a lecture i thought but it didnt disturb sandy didnt turn a feather her steam soared steadily up again the minute i took off the lid then sir marhaus turned his horse and rode toward gawaine with his spear and when sir gawaine saw that he dressed his shield and they aventred their spears and they came together with all the might of their horses that either knight smote other so hard in the midst of their shields but sir gawaines spear brake i knew it would but sir marhauss spear held and therewith sir gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth just so and brake his back and lightly sir gawaine rose upon his feet and pulled out his sword and dressed him toward sir marhaus on foot and therewith either came unto other eagerly and smote together with their swords that their shields flew in cantels and they bruised their helms and their hauberks and wounded either other but sir gawaine fro it passed nine of the clock waxed by the space of three hours ever stronger and stronger and thrice his might was increased all this espied sir marhaus and had great wonder how his might increased and so they wounded other passing sore and then when it was come noon the pelting sing song of it carried me forward to scenes and sounds of my boyhood days n e e ew haven ten minutes for refreshments knductr ll strike the gong bell two minutes before train leaves passengers for the shore line please take seats in the rear k yar this k yar dont go no furder ahh pls aw rnjzb nan ners s a n d chesp op corn and waxed past noon and drew toward evensong sir gawaines strength feebled and waxed passing faint that unnethes he might dure any longer and sir marhaus was then bigger and bigger which strained his armor of course and yet little would one of these people mind a small thing like that and so sir knight said sir marhaus i have well felt that ye are a passing good knight and a marvelous man of might as ever i felt any while it lasteth and our quarrels are not great and therefore it were a pity to do you hurt for i feel you are passing feeble ah said sir gawaine gentle knight ye say the word that i should say and therewith they took off their helms and either kissed other and there they swore together either to love other as brethren but i lost the thread there and dozed off to slumber thinking about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome iron and drenched with perspiration and hack and batter and bang each other for six hours on a stretch should not have been born at a time when they could put it to some useful purpose take a jackass for instance a jackass has that kind of strength and puts it to a useful purpose and is valuable to this world because he is a jackass but a nobleman is not valuable because he is a jackass it is a mixture that is always ineffectual and should never have been attempted in the first place and yet once you start a mistake the trouble is done and you never know what is going to come of it when i came to myself again and began to listen i perceived that i had lost another chapter and that alisande had wandered a long way off with her people and so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones and thereby they saw a fair stream of water above thereby was the head of the stream a fair fountain and three damsels sitting thereby in this country said sir marhaus came never knight since it was christened but he found strange adventures this is not good form alisande sir marhaus the kings son of ireland talks like all the rest you ought to give him a brogue or at least a characteristic expletive by this means one would recognize him as soon as he spoke without his ever being named it is a common literary device with the great authors you should make him say in this country be jabers came never knight since it was christened but he found strange adventures be jabers you see how much better that sounds came never knight but he found strange adventures be jabers of a truth it doth indeed fair lord albeit tis passing hard to say though peradventure that will not tarry but better speed with usage and then they rode to the damsels and either saluted other and the eldest had a garland of gold about her head and she was threescore winter of age or more the damsel was even so dear lord and her hair was white under the garland celluloid teeth nine dollars a set as like as not the loose fit kind that go up and down like a portcullis when you eat and fall out when you laugh the second damsel was of thirty winter of age with a circlet of gold about her head the third damsel was but fifteen year of age billows of thought came rolling over my soul and the voice faded out of my hearing fifteen break my heart oh my lost darling just her age who was so gentle and lovely and all the world to me and whom i shall never see again how the thought of her carries me back over wide seas of memory to a vague dim time a happy time so many many centuries hence when i used to wake in the soft summer mornings out of sweet dreams of her and say hello central just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a hello hank that was music of the spheres to my enchanted ear she got three dollars a week but she was worth it i could not follow alisandes further explanation of who our captured knights were now i mean in case she should ever get to explaining who they were my interest was gone my thoughts were far away and sad by fitful glimpses of the drifting tale caught here and there and now and then i merely noted in a vague way that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels up behind him on his horse and one rode north another east the other south to seek adventures and meet again and lie after year and day year and day and without baggage it was of a piece with the general simplicity of the country the sun was now setting it was about three in the afternoon when alisande had begun to tell me who the cowboys were so she had made pretty good progress with it for her she would arrive some time or other no doubt but she was not a person who could be hurried we were approaching a castle which stood on high ground a huge strong venerable structure whose gray towers and battlements were charmingly draped with ivy and whose whole majestic mass was drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun it was the largest castle we had seen and so i thought it might be the one we were after but sandy said no she did not know who owned it she said she had passed it without calling when she went down to camelot chapter xvi morgan le fay if knights errant were to be believed not all castles were desirable places to seek hospitality in as a matter of fact knights errant were not persons to be believed that is measured by modern standards of veracity yet measured by the standards of their own time and scaled accordingly you got the truth it was very simple you discounted a statement ninety seven per cent the rest was fact now after making this allowance the truth remained that if i could find out something about a castle before ringing the door bell i mean hailing the warders it was the sensible thing to do so i was pleased when i saw in the distance a horseman making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle as we approached each other i saw that he wore a plumed helmet and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel but bore a curious addition also a stiff square garment like a heralds tabard however i had to smile at my own forgetfulness when i got nearer and read this sign on his tabard persimmons soap all the prime donna use it that was a little idea of my own and had several wholesome purposes in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this nation in the first place it was a furtive underhand blow at this nonsense of knight errantry though nobody suspected that but me i had started a number of these people out the bravest knights i could get each sandwiched between bulletin boards bearing one device or another and i judged that by and by when they got to be numerous enough they would begin to look ridiculous and then even the steel clad ass that hadnt any board would himself begin to look ridiculous because he was out of the fashion secondly these missionaries would gradually and without creating suspicion or exciting alarm introduce a rudimentary cleanliness among the nobility and from them it would work down to the people if the priests could be kept quiet this would undermine the church i mean would be a step toward that next education next freedom and then she would begin to crumble it being my conviction that any established church is an established crime an established slave pen i had no scruples but was willing to assail it in any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it why in my own former day in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb of time there were old englishmen who imagined that they had been born in a free country a free country with the corporation act and the test still in force in it timbers propped against mens liberties and dishonored consciences to shore up an established anachronism with my missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their tabards the showy gilding was a neat idea i could have got the king to wear a bulletin board for the sake of that barbaric splendor they were to spell out these signs and then explain to the lords and ladies what soap was and if the lords and ladies were afraid of it get them to try it on a dog the missionarys next move was to get the family together and try it on himself he was to stop at no experiment however desperate that could convince the nobility that soap was harmless if any final doubt remained he must catch a hermit the woods were full of them saints they called themselves and saints they were believed to be they were unspeakably holy and worked miracles and everybody stood in awe of them if a hermit could survive a wash and that failed to convince a duke give him up let him alone whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road they washed him and when he got well they swore him to go and get a bulletin board and disseminate soap and civilization the rest of his days as a consequence the workers in the field were increasing by degrees and the reform was steadily spreading my soap factory felt the strain early at first i had only two hands but before i had left home i was already employing fifteen and running night and day and the atmospheric result was getting so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer and sir launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up and down the roof and swear although i told him it was worse up there than anywhere else but he said he wanted plenty of air and he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap factory anyway and said if a man was to start one in his house he would be damned if he wouldnt strangle him there were ladies present too but much these people ever cared for that they would swear before children if the wind was their way when the factory was going this missionary knights name was la cote male taile and he said that this castle was the abode of morgan le fay sister of king arthur and wife of king uriens monarch of a realm about as big as the district of columbia you could stand in the middle of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom kings and kingdoms were as thick in britain as they had been in little palestine in joshuas time when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up because they couldnt stretch out without a passport la cote was much depressed for he had scored here the worst failure of his campaign he had not worked off a cake yet he had tried all the tricks of the trade even to the washing of a hermit but the hermit died this was indeed a bad failure for this animal would now be dubbed a martyr and would take his place among the saints of the roman calendar thus made he his moan this poor sir la cote male taile and sorrowed passing sore and so my heart bled for him and i was moved to comfort and stay him wherefore i said forbear to grieve fair knight for this is not a defeat we have brains you and i and for such as have brains there are no defeats but only victories observe how we will turn this seeming disaster into an advertisement an advertisement for our soap and the biggest one to draw that was ever thought of an advertisement that will transform that mount washington defeat into a matterhorn victory we will put on your bulletin board patronized by the elect how does that strike you verily it is wonderly bethought well a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little one line ad its a corker so the poor colporteurs griefs vanished away he was a brave fellow and had done mighty feats of arms in his time his chief celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one of mine which he had once made with a damsel named maledisant who was as handy with her tongue as was sandy though in a different way for her tongue churned forth only railings and insult whereas sandys music was of a kindlier sort i knew his story well and so i knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he bade me farewell he supposed i was having a bitter hard time of it sandy and i discussed his story as we rode along and she said that la cotes bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that trip for the kings fool had overthrown him on the first day and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the conqueror but maledisant didnt do it and also persisted afterward in sticking to him after all his defeats but said i suppose the victor should decline to accept his spoil she said that that wouldnt answer he must he couldnt decline it wouldnt be regular i made a note of that if sandys music got to be too burdensome some time i would let a knight defeat me on the chance that she would desert to him in due time we were challenged by the warders from the castle walls and after a parley admitted i have nothing pleasant to tell about that visit but it was not a disappointment for i knew mrs le fay by reputation and was not expecting anything pleasant she was held in awe by the whole realm for she had made everybody believe she was a great sorceress all her ways were wicked all her instincts devilish she was loaded to the eyelids with cold malice all her history was black with crime and among her crimes murder was common i was most curious to see her as curious as i could have been to see satan to my surprise she was beautiful black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive age had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness she could have passed for old uriens granddaughter she could have been mistaken for sister to her own son as soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered into her presence king uriens was there a kind faced old man with a subdued look and also the son sir uwaine le blanchemains in whom i was of course interested on account of the tradition that he had once done battle with thirty knights and also on account of his trip with sir gawaine and sir marhaus which sandy had been aging me with but morgan was the main attraction the conspicuous personality here she was head chief of this household that was plain she caused us to be seated and then she began with all manner of pretty graces and graciousnesses to ask me questions dear me it was like a bird or a flute or something talking i felt persuaded that this woman must have been misrepresented lied about she trilled along and trilled along and presently a handsome young page clothed like the rainbow and as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave came with something on a golden salver and kneeling to present it to her overdid his graces and lost his balance and so fell lightly against her knee she slipped a dirk into him in as matter of course a way as another person would have harpooned a rat poor child he slumped to the floor twisted his silken limbs in one great straining contortion of pain and was dead out of the old king was wrung an involuntaryo h of compassion the look he got made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more hyphens in it sir uwaine at a sign from his mother went to the anteroom and called some servants and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly along with her talk i saw that she was a good housekeeper for while she talked she kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made no balks in handling the body and getting it out when they came with fresh clean towels she sent back for the other kind and when they had finished wiping the floor and were going she indicated a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had overlooked it was plain to me that la cote male taile had failed to see the mistress of the house often how louder and clearer than any tongue does dumb circumstantial evidence speak morgan le fay rippled along as musically as ever marvelous woman and what a glance she had when it fell in reproof upon those servants they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the lightning flashes out of a cloud i could have got the habit myself it was the same with that poor old brer uriens he was always on the ragged edge of apprehension she could not even turn toward him but he winced in the midst of the talk i let drop a complimentary word about king arthur forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her brother that one little compliment was enough she clouded up like storm she called for her guards and said hale me these varlets to the dungeons that struck cold on my ears for her dungeons had a reputation nothing occurred to me to say or do but not so with sandy as the guard laid a hand upon me she piped up with the tranquilest confidence and said gods wounds dost thou covet destruction thou maniac it is the boss now what a happy idea that was and so simple yet it would never have occurred to me i was born modest not all over but in spots and this was one of the spots the effect upon madame was electrical it cleared her countenance and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and blandishments but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright she said la but do list to thine handmaid as if one gifted with powers like to mine might say the thing which i have said unto one who has vanquished merlin and not be jesting by mine enchantments i foresaw your coming and by them i knew you when you entered here i did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you into some display of your art as not doubting you would blast the guards with occult fires consuming them to ashes on the spot a marvel much beyond mine own ability yet one which i have long been childishly curious to see the guards were less curious and got out as soon as they got permission chapter xvii a royal banquet madame seeing me pacific and unresentful no doubt judged that i was deceived by her excuse for her fright dissolved away and she was soon so importunate to have me give an exhibition and kill somebody that the thing grew to be embarrassing however to my relief she was presently interrupted by the call to prayers i will say this much for the nobility that tyrannical murderous rapacious and morally rotten as they were they were deeply and enthusiastically religious nothing could divert them from the regular and faithful performance of the pieties enjoined by the church more than once i had seen a noble who had gotten his enemy at a disadvantage stop to pray before cutting his throat more than once i had seen a noble after ambushing and despatching his enemy retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give thanks without even waiting to rob the body there was to be nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even benvenuto cellini that rough hewn saint ten centuries later all the nobles of britain with their families attended divine service morning and night daily in their private chapels and even the worst of them had family worship five or six times a day besides the credit of this belonged entirely to the church although i was no friend to that catholic church i was obliged to admit this and often in spite of me i found myself saying what would this country be without the church after prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was lighted by hundreds of grease jets and everything was as fine and lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the hosts at the head of the hall on a dais was the table of the king queen and their son prince uwaine stretching down the hall from this was the general table on the floor at this above the salt sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their families of both sexes the resident court in effect sixty one persons below the salt sat minor officers of the household with their principal subordinates altogether a hundred and eighteen persons sitting and about as many liveried servants standing behind their chairs or serving in one capacity or another it was a very fine show in a gallery a band with cymbals horns harps and other horrors opened the proceedings with what seemed to be the crude first draft or original agony of the wail known to later centuries as in the sweet bye and bye it was new and ought to have been rehearsed a little more for some reason or other the queen had the composer hanged after dinner after this music the priest who stood behind the royal table said a noble long grace in ostensible latin then the battalion of waiters broke away from their posts and darted rushed flew fetched and carried and the mighty feeding began no words anywhere but absorbing attention to business the rows of chops opened and shut in vast unison and the sound of it was like to the muffled burr of subterranean machinery the havoc continued an hour and a half and unimaginable was the destruction of substantials of the chief feature of the feast the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing at the start nothing was left but the semblance of a hoop skirt and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all the other dishes with the pastries and so on the heavy drinking began and the talk gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared and everybody got comfortable then happy then sparklingly joyous both sexes and by and by pretty noisy men told anecdotes that were terrific to hear but nobody blushed and when the nub was sprung the assemblage let go with a horse laugh that shook the fortress ladies answered back with historiettes that would almost have made queen margaret of navarre or even the great elizabeth of england hide behind a handkerchief but nobody hid here but only laughed howled you may say in pretty much all of these dreadful stories ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes but that didnt worry the chaplain any he had his laugh with the rest more than that upon invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as any that was sung that night by midnight everybody was fagged out and sore with laughing and as a rule drunk some weepingly some affectionately some hilariously some quarrelsomely some dead and under the table of the ladies the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess whose wedding eve this was and indeed she was a spectacle sure enough just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the young daughter of the regent d orleans at the famous dinner whence she was carried foul mouthed intoxicated and helpless to her bed in the lost and lamented days of the ancient regime suddenly even while the priest was lifting his hands and all conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming blessing there appeared under the arch of the far off door at the bottom of the hall an old and bent and white haired lady leaning upon a crutch stick and she lifted the stick and pointed it toward the queen and cried out the wrath and curse of god fall upon you woman without pity who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this old heart that had nor chick nor friend nor stay nor comfort in all this world but him everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright for a curse was an awful thing to those people but the queen rose up majestic with the death light in her eye and flung back this ruthless command lay hands on her to the stake with her the guards left their posts to obey it was a shame it was a cruel thing to see what could be done sandy gave me a look i knew she had another inspiration i said do what you choose she was up and facing toward the queen in a moment she indicated me and said madame he saith this may not be recall the commandment or he will dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the instable fabric of a dream confound it what a crazy contract to pledge a person to what if the queen but my consternation subsided there and my panic passed off for the queen all in a collapse made no show of resistance but gave a countermanding sign and sunk into her seat when she reached it she was sober so were many of the others the assemblage rose whiffed ceremony to the winds and rushed for the door like a mob overturning chairs smashing crockery tugging struggling shouldering crowding anything to get out before i should change my mind and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of space well well well they were a superstitious lot it is all a body can do to conceive of it the poor queen was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid to hang the composer without first consulting me i was very sorry for her indeed any one would have been for she was really suffering so i was willing to do anything that was reasonable and had no desire to carry things to wanton extremities i therefore considered the matter thoughtfully and ended by having the musicians ordered into our presence to play that sweet bye and bye again which they did then i saw that she was right and gave her permission to hang the whole band this little relaxation of sternness had a good effect upon the queen a statesman gains little by the arbitrary exercise of iron clad authority upon all occasions that offer for this wounds the just pride of his subordinates and thus tends to undermine his strength a little concession now and then where it can do no harm is the wiser policy now that the queen was at ease in her mind once more and measurably happy her wine naturally began to assert itself again and it got a little the start of her i mean it set her music going her silver bell of a tongue dear me she was a master talker it would not become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that i was a tired man and very sleepy i wished i had gone off to bed when i had the chance now i must stick it out there was no other way so she tinkled along and along in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle until by and by there came as if from deep down under us a far away sound as of a muffled shriek with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl the queen stopped and her eyes lighted with pleasure she tilted her graceful head as a bird does when it listens the sound bored its way up through the stillness again what is it i said it is truly a stubborn soul and endureth long it is many hours now endureth what the rack come ye shall see a blithe sight an he yield not his secret now ye shall see him torn asunder what a silky smooth hellion she was and so composed and serene when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that mans pain conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches we tramped along echoing corridors and down stone stairways dank and dripping and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night a chill uncanny journey and a long one and not made the shorter or the cheerier by the sorceresss talk which was about this sufferer and his crime he had been accused by an anonymous informer of having killed a stag in the royal preserves i said anonymous testimony isnt just the right thing your highness it were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser i had not thought of that it being but of small consequence but an i would i could not for that the accuser came masked by night and told the forester and straightway got him hence again and so the forester knoweth him not then is this unknown the only person who saw the stag killed marry no man saw the killing but this unknown saw this hardy wretch near to the spot where the stag lay and came with right loyal zeal and betrayed him to the forester so the unknown was near the dead stag too isnt it just possible that he did the killing himself his loyal zeal in a mask looks just a shade suspicious but what is your highnesss idea for racking the prisoner where is the profit he will not confess else and then were his soul lost for his crime his life is forfeited by the law and of a surety will i see that he payeth it but it were peril to my own soul to let him die unconfessed and unabsolved nay i were a fool to fling me into hell for his accommodation but your highness suppose he has nothing to confess as to that we shall see anon an i rack him to death and he confess not it will peradventure show that he had indeed naught to confess ye will grant that that is sooth then shall i not be damned for an unconfessed man that had naught to confess wherefore i shall be safe it was the stubborn unreasoning of the time it was useless to argue with her arguments have no chance against petrified training they wear it as little as the waves wear a cliff and her training was everybodys the brightest intellect in the land would not have been able to see that her position was defective as we entered the rack cell i caught a picture that will not go from me i wish it would a native young giant of thirty or thereabouts lay stretched upon the frame on his back with his wrists and ankles tied to ropes which led over windlasses at either end there was no color in him his features were contorted and set and sweat drops stood upon his forehead a priest bent over him on each side the executioner stood by guards were on duty smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls in a corner crouched a poor young creature her face drawn with anguish a half wild and hunted look in her eyes and in her lap lay a little child asleep just as we stepped across the threshold the executioner gave his machine a slight turn which wrung a cry from both the prisoner and the woman but i shouted and the executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke i could not let this horror go on it would have killed me to see it i asked the queen to let me clear the place and speak to the prisoner privately and when she was going to object i spoke in a low voice and said i did not want to make a scene before her servants but i must have my way for i was king arthurs representative and was speaking in his name she saw she had to yield i asked her to indorse me to these people and then leave me it was not pleasant for her but she took the pill and even went further than i was meaning to require i only wanted the backing of her own authority but she said ye will do in all things as this lord shall command it is the boss it was certainly a good word to conjure with you could see it by the squirming of these rats the queens guards fell into line and she and they marched away with their torch bearers and woke the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their retreating footfalls i had the prisoner taken from the rack and placed upon his bed and medicaments applied to his hurts and wine given him to drink the woman crept near and looked on eagerly lovingly but timorously like one who fears a repulse indeed she tried furtively to touch the mans forehead and jumped back the picture of fright when i turned unconsciously toward her it was pitiful to see lord i said stroke him lass if you want to do anything you re a mind to dont mind me why her eyes were as grateful as an animals when you do it a kindness that it understands the baby was out of her way and she had her cheek against the mans in a minute and her hands fondling his hair and her happy tears running down the man revived and caressed his wife with his eyes which was all he could do i judged i might clear the den now and i did cleared it of all but the family and myself then i said now my friend tell me your side of this matter i know the other side the man moved his head in sign of refusal but the woman looked pleased as it seemed to me pleased with my suggestion i went on you know of me yes all do in arthurs realms if my reputation has come to you right and straight you should not be afraid to speak the woman broke in eagerly ah fair my lord do thou persuade him thou canst an thou wilt ah he suffereth so and it is for me for me and how can i bear it i would i might see him die a sweet swift death oh my hugo i cannot bear this one and she fell to sobbing and grovelling about my feet and still imploring imploring what the mans death i could not quite get the bearings of the thing but hugo interrupted her and said peace ye wit not what ye ask shall i starve whom i love to win a gentle death i wend thou knewest me better well i said i cant quite make this out it is a puzzle now ah dear my lord an ye will but persuade him consider how these his tortures wound me oh and he will not speak whereas the healing the solace that lie in a blessed swift death what are you maundering about hes going out from here a free man and whole hes not going to die the mans white face lit up and the woman flung herself at me in a most surprising explosion of joy and cried out he is saved for it is the kings word by the mouth of the kings servant arthur the king whose word is gold well then you do believe i can be trusted after all why didnt you before who doubted not i indeed and not she well why wouldnt you tell me your story then ye had made no promise else had it been otherwise i see i see and yet i believe i dont quite see after all you stood the torture and refused to confess which shows plain enough to even the dullest understanding that you had nothing to confess i my lord how so it was i that killed the deer you did oh dear this is the most mixed up business that ever dear lord i begged him on my knees to confess but you did it gets thicker and thicker what did you want him to do that for sith it would bring him a quick death and save him all this cruel pain well yes there is reason in that but he didnt want the quick death he why of a surety he did well then why in the world didnt he confess ah sweet sir and leave my wife and chick without bread and shelter oh heart of gold now i see it the bitter law takes the convicted mans estate and beggars his widow and his orphans they could torture you to death but without conviction or confession they could not rob your wife and baby you stood by them like a man and you true wife and the woman that you are you would have bought him release from torture at cost to yourself of slow starvation and death well it humbles a body to think what your sex can do when it comes to self sacrifice i ll book you both for my colony you ll like it there its a factory where im going to turn groping and grubbing automata into men chapter xviii in the queens dungeons well i arranged all that and i had the man sent to his home i had a great desire to rack the executioner not because he was a good painstaking and paingiving official for surely it was not to his discredit that he performed his functions well but to pay him back for wantonly cuffing and otherwise distressing that young woman the priests told me about this and were generously hot to have him punished something of this disagreeable sort was turning up every now and then i mean episodes that showed that not all priests were frauds and self seekers but that many even the great majority of these that were down on the ground among the common people were sincere and right hearted and devoted to the alleviation of human troubles and sufferings well it was a thing which could not be helped so i seldom fretted about it and never many minutes at a time it has never been my way to bother much about things which you cant cure but i did not like it for it was just the sort of thing to keep people reconciled to an established church we must have a religion it goes without saying but my idea is to have it cut up into forty free sects so that they will police each other as had been the case in the united states in my time concentration of power in a political machine is bad and an established church is only a political machine it was invented for that it is nursed cradled preserved for that it is an enemy to human liberty and does no good which it could not better do in a split up and scattered condition that wasnt law it wasnt gospel it was only an opinion my opinion and i was only a man one man so it wasnt worth any more than the popes or any less for that matter well i couldnt rack the executioner neither would i overlook the just complaint of the priests the man must be punished somehow or other so i degraded him from his office and made him leader of the band the new one that was to be started he begged hard and said he couldnt play a plausible excuse but too thin there wasnt a musician in the country that could the queen was a good deal outraged next morning when she found she was going to have neither hugos life nor his property but i told her she must bear this cross that while by law and custom she certainly was entitled to both the mans life and his property there were extenuating circumstances and so in arthur the kings name i had pardoned him the deer was ravaging the mans fields and he had killed it in sudden passion and not for gain and he had carried it into the royal forest in the hope that that might make detection of the misdoer impossible confound her i couldnt make her see that sudden passion is an extenuating circumstance in the killing of venison or of a person so i gave it up and let her sulk it out i did think i was going to make her see it by remarking that her own sudden passion in the case of the page modified that crime crime she exclaimed how thou talkest crime forsooth man i am going to pay for him oh it was no use to waste sense on her training training is everything training is all there is to a person we speak of nature it is folly there is no such thing as nature what we call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training we have no thoughts of our own no opinions of our own they are transmitted to us trained into us all that is original in us and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle all the rest being atoms contributed by and inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the adam clam or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed and as for me all that i think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage this pathetic drift between the eternities is to look out and humbly live a pure and high and blameless life and save that one microscopic atom in me that is truly me the rest may land in sheol and welcome for all i care no confound her her intellect was good she had brains enough but her training made her an ass that is from a many centuries later point of view to kill the page was no crime it was her right and upon her right she stood serenely and unconscious of offense she was a result of generations of training in the unexamined and unassailed belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject when she chose was a perfectly right and righteous one well we must give even satan his due she deserved a compliment for one thing and i tried to pay it but the words stuck in my throat she had a right to kill the boy but she was in no wise obliged to pay for him that was law for some other people but not for her she knew quite well that she was doing a large and generous thing to pay for that lad and that i ought in common fairness to come out with something handsome about it but i couldnt my mouth refused i couldnt help seeing in my fancy that poor old grandma with the broken heart and that fair young creature lying butchered his little silken pomps and vanities laced with his golden blood how could she pay for him whom could she pay and so well knowing that this woman trained as she had been deserved praise even adulation i was yet not able to utter it trained as i had been the best i could do was to fish up a compliment from outside so to speak and the pity of it was that it was true madame your people will adore you for this quite true but i meant to hang her for it some day if i lived some of those laws were too bad altogether too bad a master might kill his slave for nothing for mere spite malice or to pass the time just as we have seen that the crowned head could do it with his slave that is to say anybody a gentleman could kill a free commoner and pay for him cash or garden truck a noble could kill a noble without expense as far as the law was concerned but reprisals in kind were to be expected any body could kill some body except the commoner and the slave these had no privileges if they killed it was murder and the law wouldnt stand murder it made short work of the experimenter and of his family too if he murdered somebody who belonged up among the ornamental ranks if a commoner gave a noble even so much as a damiens scratch which didnt kill or even hurt he got damiens dose for it just the same they pulled him to rags and tatters with horses and all the world came to see the show and crack jokes and have a good time and some of the performances of the best people present were as tough and as properly unprintable as any that have been printed by the pleasant casanova in his chapter about the dismemberment of louis xvs poor awkward enemy i had had enough of this grisly place by this time and wanted to leave but i couldnt because i had something on my mind that my conscience kept prodding me about and wouldnt let me forget if i had the remaking of man he wouldnt have any conscience it is one of the most disagreeable things connected with a person and although it certainly does a great deal of good it cannot be said to pay in the long run it would be much better to have less good and more comfort still this is only my opinion and i am only one man others with less experience may think differently they have a right to their view i only stand to this i have noticed my conscience for many years and i know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else i started with i suppose that in the beginning i prized it because we prize anything that is ours and yet how foolish it was to think so if we look at it in another way we see how absurd it is if i had an anvil in me would i prize it of course not and yet when you come to think there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil i mean for comfort i have noticed it a thousand times and you could dissolve an anvil with acids when you couldnt stand it any longer but there isnt any way that you can work off a conscience at least so it will stay worked off not that i know of anyway there was something i wanted to do before leaving but it was a disagreeable matter and i hated to go at it well it bothered me all the morning i could have mentioned it to the old king but what would be the use he was but an extinct volcano he had been active in his time but his fire was out this good while he was only a stately ash pile now gentle enough and kindly enough for my purpose without doubt but not usable he was nothing this so called king the queen was the only power there and she was a vesuvius as a favor she might consent to warm a flock of sparrows for you but then she might take that very opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city however i reflected that as often as any other way when you are expecting the worst you get something that is not so bad after all so i braced up and placed my matter before her royal highness i said i had been having a general jail delivery at camelot and among neighboring castles and with her permission i would like to examine her collection her bric a brac that is to say her prisoners she resisted but i was expecting that but she finally consented i was expecting that too but not so soon that about ended my discomfort she called her guards and torches and we went down into the dungeons these were down under the castles foundations and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living rock some of these cells had no light at all in one of them was a woman in foul rags who sat on the ground and would not answer a question or speak a word but only looked up at us once or twice through a cobweb of tangled hair as if to see what casual thing it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless dull dream that was become her life after that she sat bowed with her dirt caked fingers idly interlocked in her lap and gave no further sign this poor rack of bones was a woman of middle age apparently but only apparently she had been there nine years and was eighteen when she entered she was a commoner and had been sent here on her bridal night by sir breuse sance pite a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was and to which said lord she had refused what has since been called le droit du seigneur and moreover had opposed violence to violence and spilt half a gill of his almost sacred blood the young husband had interfered at that point believing the brides life in danger and had flung the noble out into the midst of the humble and trembling wedding guests in the parlor and left him there astonished at this strange treatment and implacably embittered against both bride and groom the said lord being cramped for dungeon room had asked the queen to accommodate his two criminals and here in her bastile they had been ever since hither indeed they had come before their crime was an hour old and had never seen each other since here they were kenneled like toads in the same rock they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet of each other yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not all the first years their only question had been asked with beseechings and tears that might have moved stones in time perhaps but hearts are not stones is he alive is she alive but they had never got an answer and at last that question was not asked any more or any other i wanted to see the man after hearing all this he was thirty four years old and looked sixty he sat upon a squared block of stone with his head bent down his forearms resting on his knees his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face and he was muttering to himself he raised his chin and looked us slowly over in a listless dull way blinking with the distress of the torchlight then dropped his head and fell to muttering again and took no further notice of us there were some pathetically suggestive dumb witnesses present on his wrists and ankles were cicatrices old smooth scars and fastened to the stone on which he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters attached but this apparatus lay idle on the ground and was thick with rust chains cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner i could not rouse the man so i said we would take him to her and see to the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him once roses pearls and dew made flesh for him a wonder work the master work of nature with eyes like no other eyes and voice like no other voice and a freshness and lithe young grace and beauty that belonged properly to the creatures of dreams as he thought and to no other the sight of her would set his stagnant blood leaping the sight of her but it was a disappointment they sat together on the ground and looked dimly wondering into each others faces a while with a sort of weak animal curiosity then forgot each others presence and dropped their eyes and you saw that they were away again and wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know nothing about i had them taken out and sent to their friends the queen did not like it much not that she felt any personal interest in the matter but she thought it disrespectful to sir breuse sance pite however i assured her that if he found he couldnt stand it i would fix him so that he could i set forty seven prisoners loose out of those awful rat holes and left only one in captivity he was a lord and had killed another lord a sort of kinsman of the queen that other lord had ambushed him to assassinate him but this fellow had got the best of him and cut his throat however it was not for that that i left him jailed but for maliciously destroying the only public well in one of his wretched villages the queen was bound to hang him for killing her kinsman but i would not allow it it was no crime to kill an assassin but i said i was willing to let her hang him for destroying the well so she concluded to put up with that as it was better than nothing dear me for what trifling offenses the most of those forty seven men and women were shut up there indeed some were there for no distinct offense at all but only to gratify somebodys spite and not always the queens by any means but a friends the newest prisoners crime was a mere remark which he had made he said he believed that men were about all alike and one man as good as another barring clothes he said he believed that if you were to strip the nation naked and send a stranger through the crowd he couldnt tell the king from a quack doctor nor a duke from a hotel clerk apparently here was a man whose brains had not been reduced to an ineffectual mush by idiotic training i set him loose and sent him to the factory some of the cells carved in the living rock were just behind the face of the precipice and in each of these an arrow slit had been pierced outward to the daylight and so the captive had a thin ray from the blessed sun for his comfort the case of one of these poor fellows was particularly hard from his dusky swallows hole high up in that vast wall of native rock he could peer out through the arrow slit and see his own home off yonder in the valley and for twenty two years he had watched it with heartache and longing through that crack he could see the lights shine there at night and in the daytime he could see figures go in and come out his wife and children some of them no doubt though he could not make out at that distance in the course of years he noted festivities there and tried to rejoice and wondered if they were weddings or what they might be and he noted funerals and they wrung his heart he could make out the coffin but he could not determine its size and so could not tell whether it was wife or child he could see the procession form with priests and mourners and move solemnly away bearing the secret with them he had left behind him five children and a wife and in nineteen years he had seen five funerals issue and none of them humble enough in pomp to denote a servant so he had lost five of his treasures there must still be one remaining one now infinitely unspeakably precious but which one wife or child that was the question that tortured him by night and by day asleep and awake well to have an interest of some sort and half a ray of light when you are in a dungeon is a great support to the body and preserver of the intellect this man was in pretty good condition yet by the time he had finished telling me his distressful tale i was in the same state of mind that you would have been in yourself if you have got average human curiosity that is to say i was as burning up as he was to find out which member of the family it was that was left so i took him over home myself and an amazing kind of a surprise party it was too typhoons and cyclones of frantic joy and whole niagaras of happy tears and by george we found the aforetime young matron graying toward the imminent verge of her half century and the babies all men and women and some of them married and experimenting familywise themselves for not a soul of the tribe was dead conceive of the ingenious devilishness of that queen she had a special hatred for this prisoner and she had invented all those funerals herself to scorch his heart with and the sublimest stroke of genius of the whole thing was leaving the family invoice a funeral short so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing but for me he never would have got out morgan le fay hated him with her whole heart and she never would have softened toward him and yet his crime was committed more in thoughtlessness than deliberate depravity he had said she had red hair well she had but that was no way to speak of it when red headed people are above a certain social grade their hair is auburn consider it among these forty seven captives there were five whose names offenses and dates of incarceration were no longer known one woman and four men all bent and wrinkled and mind extinguished patriarchs they themselves had long ago forgotten these details at any rate they had mere vague theories about them nothing definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same way the succession of priests whose office it had been to pray daily with the captives and remind them that god had put them there for some wise purpose or other and teach them that patience humbleness and submission to oppression was what he loved to see in parties of a subordinate rank had traditions about these poor old human ruins but nothing more these traditions went but little way for they concerned the length of the incarceration only and not the names of the offenses and even by the help of tradition the only thing that could be proven was that none of the five had seen daylight for thirty five years how much longer this privation has lasted was not guessable the king and the queen knew nothing about these poor creatures except that they were heirlooms assets inherited along with the throne from the former firm nothing of their history had been transmitted with their persons and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no value and had felt no interest in them i said to the queen then why in the world didnt you set them free the question was a puzzler she didnt know why she hadnt the thing had never come up in her mind so here she was forecasting the veritable history of future prisoners of the castle d if without knowing it it seemed plain to me now that with her training those inherited prisoners were merely property nothing more nothing less well when we inherit property it does not occur to us to throw it away even when we do not value it when i brought my procession of human bats up into the open world and the glare of the afternoon sun previously blindfolding them in charity for eyes so long untortured by light they were a spectacle to look at skeletons scarecrows goblins pathetic frights every one legitimatest possible children of monarchy by the grace of god and the established church i muttered absently i wish i could photograph them you have seen that kind of people who will never let on that they dont know the meaning of a new big word the more ignorant they are the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you havent shot over their heads the queen was just one of that sort and was always making the stupidest blunders by reason of it she hesitated a moment then her face brightened up with sudden comprehension and she said she would do it for me i thought to myself she why what can she know about photography but it was a poor time to be thinking when i looked around she was moving on the procession with an axe well she certainly was a curious one was morgan le fay i have seen a good many kinds of women in my time but she laid over them all for variety and how sharply characteristic of her this episode was she had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph a procession but being in doubt it was just like her to try to do it with an axe chapter xix knight errantry as a trade sandy and i were on the road again next morning bright and early it was so good to open up ones lungs and take in whole luscious barrels ful of the blessed gods untainted dew fashioned woodland scented air once more after suffocating body and mind for two days and nights in the moral and physical stenches of that intolerable old buzzard roost i mean for me of course the place was all right and agreeable enough for sandy for she had been used to high life all her days poor girl her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while and i was expecting to get the consequences i was right but she had stood by me most helpfully in the castle and had mightily supported and reinforced me with gigantic foolishnesses which were worth more for the occasion than wisdoms double their size so i thought she had earned a right to work her mill for a while if she wanted to and i felt not a pang when she started it up now turn we unto sir marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty winter of age southward are you going to see if you can work up another half stretch on the trail of the cowboys sandy even so fair my lord go ahead then i wont interrupt this time if i can help it begin over again start fair and shake out all your reefs and i will load my pipe and give good attention now turn we unto sir marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty winter of age southward and so they came into a deep forest and by fortune they were nighted and rode along in a deep way and at the last they came into a courtelage where abode the duke of south marches and there they asked harbour and on the morn the duke sent unto sir marhaus and bad him make him ready and so sir marhaus arose and armed him and there was a mass sung afore him and he brake his fast and so mounted on horseback in the court of the castle there they should do the battle so there was the duke already on horseback clean armed and his six sons by him and every each had a spear in his hand and so they encountered whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him but sir marhaus held up his spear and touched none of them then came the four sons by couples and two of them brake their spears and so did the other two and all this while sir marhaus touched them not then sir marhaus ran to the duke and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth and so he served his sons and then sir marhaus alight down and bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him and then some of his sons recovered and would have set upon sir marhaus then sir marhaus said to the duke cease thy sons or else i will do the uttermost to you all when the duke saw he might not escape the death he cried to his sons and charged them to yield them to sir marhaus and they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their swords to the knight and so he received them and then they holp up their father and so by their common assent promised unto sir marhaus never to be foes unto king arthur and thereupon at whitsuntide after to come he and his sons and put them in the kings grace footnote the story is borrowed language and all from the morte d arthurm t even so standeth the history fair sir boss now ye shall wit that that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days past you also did overcome and send to arthurs court why sandy you cant mean it an i speak not sooth let it be the worse for me well well well now who would ever have thought it one whole duke and six dukelets why sandy it was an elegant haul knight errantry is a most chuckle headed trade and it is tedious hard work too but i begin to see that there is money in it after all if you have luck not that i would ever engage in it as a business for i wouldnt no sound and legitimate business can be established on a basis of speculation a successful whirl in the knight errantry line now what is it when you blow away the nonsense and come down to the cold facts its just a corner in pork thats all and you cant make anything else out of it you re rich yes suddenly rich for about a day maybe a week then somebody corners the market on you and down goes your bucket shop aint that so sandy whethersoever it be that my mind miscarrieth bewraying simple language in such sort that the words do seem to come endlong and overthwart theres no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around it that way sandy its so just as i say i know its so and moreover when you come right down to the bedrock knight errantry is worse than pork for whatever happens the porks left and so somebodys benefited anyway but when the market breaks in a knight errantry whirl and every knight in the pool passes in his checks what have you got for assets just a rubbish pile of battered corpses and a barrel or two of busted hardware can you call those assets give me pork every time am i right ah peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold matters whereunto the confusions of these but late adventured haps and fortunings whereby not i alone nor you alone but every each of us meseemeth no its not your head sandy your heads all right as far as it goes but you dont know business thats where the trouble is it unfits you to argue about business and you re wrong to be always trying however that aside it was a good haul anyway and will breed a handsome crop of reputation in arthurs court and speaking of the cowboys what a curious country this is for women and men that never get old now theres morgan le fay as fresh and young as a vassar pullet to all appearances and here is this old duke of the south marches still slashing away with sword and lance at his time of life after raising such a family as he has raised as i understand it sir gawaine killed seven of his sons and still he had six left for sir marhaus and me to take into camp and then there was that damsel of sixty winter of age still excursioning around in her frosty bloom how old are you sandy it was the first time i ever struck a still place in her the mill had shut down for repairs or something chapter xx the ogres castle between six and nine we made ten miles which was plenty for a horse carrying triple man woman and armor then we stopped for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook right so came by and by a knight riding and as he drew near he made dolorous moan and by the words of it i perceived that he was cursing and swearing yet nevertheless was i glad of his coming for that i saw he bore a bulletin board whereon in letters all of shining gold was writ use petersons prophylactic tooth brush all the go i was glad of his coming for even by this token i knew him for knight of mine it was sir madok de la montaine a burly great fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace of sending sir launcelot down over his horse tail once he was never long in a strangers presence without finding some pretext or other to let out that great fact but there was another fact of nearly the same size which he never pushed upon anybody unasked and yet never withheld when asked that was that the reason he didnt quite succeed was that he was interrupted and sent down over horse tail himself this innocent vast lubber did not see any particular difference between the two facts i liked him for he was earnest in his work and very valuable and he was so fine to look at with his broad mailed shoulders and the grand leonine set of his plumed head and his big shield with its quaint device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth brush with motto try noyoudont this was a tooth wash that i was introducing he was aweary he said and indeed he looked it but he would not alight he said he was after the stove polish man and with this he broke out cursing and swearing anew the bulletin boarder referred to was sir ossaise of surluse a brave knight and of considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament once with no less a mogul than sir gaheris himself although not successfully he was of a light and laughing disposition and to him nothing in this world was serious it was for this reason that i had chosen him to work up a stove polish sentiment there were no stoves yet and so there could be nothing serious about stove polish all that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change and have them established in predilections toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear upon the stage sir madok was very bitter and brake out anew with cursings he said he had cursed his soul to rags and yet he would not get down from his horse neither would he take any rest or listen to any comfort until he should have found sir ossaise and settled this account it appeared by what i could piece together of the unprofane fragments of his statement that he had chanced upon sir ossaise at dawn of the morning and been told that if he would make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and glades he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare customers for prophylactics and tooth wash with characteristic zeal sir madok had plunged away at once upon this quest and after three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game and behold it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the dungeons the evening before poor old creatures it was all of twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth blank blank blank him said sir madok an i do not stove polish him an i may find him leave it to me for never no knight that hight ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide on live an i may find him the which i have thereunto sworn a great oath this day and with these words and others he lightly took his spear and gat him thence in the middle of the afternoon we came upon one of those very patriarchs ourselves in the edge of a poor village he was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not seen for fifty years and about him and caressing him were also descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now but to him these were all strangers his memory was gone his mind was stagnant it seemed incredible that a man could outlast half a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat but here were his old wife and some old comrades to testify to it they could remember him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mothers hands and went away into that long oblivion the people at the castle could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense but this old wife knew and so did her old child who stood there among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father who had been to her a name a thought a formless image a tradition all her life and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh and blood and set before her face it was a curious situation yet it is not on that account that i have made room for it here but on account of a thing which seemed to me still more curious to wit that this dreadful matter brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against these oppressors they had been heritors and subjects of cruelty and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness yes here was a curious revelation indeed of the depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery their entire being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience resignation dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in this life their very imagination was dead when you can say that of a man he has struck bottom i reckon there is no lower deep for him i rather wished i had gone some other road this was not the sort of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a peaceful revolution in his mind for it could not help bringing up the unget aroundable fact that all gentle cant and philosophizing to the contrary notwithstanding no people in the world ever did achieve their freedom by goody goody talk and moral suasion it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must begin in blood whatever may answer afterward if history teaches anything it teaches that what this folk needed then was a reign of terror and a guillotine and i was the wrong man for them two days later toward noon sandy began to show signs of excitement and feverish expectancy she said we were approaching the ogres castle i was surprised into an uncomfortable shock the object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment and roused up in me a smart interest sandys excitement increased every moment and so did mine for that sort of thing is catching my heart got to thumping you cant reason with your heart it has its own laws and thumps about things which the intellect scorns presently when sandy slid from the horse motioned me to stop and went creeping stealthily with her head bent nearly to her knees toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity the thumpings grew stronger and quicker and they kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity and also while i was creeping to her side on my knees her eyes were burning now as she pointed with her finger and said in a panting whisper the castle the castle lo where it looms what a welcome disappointment i experienced i said castle it is nothing but a pigsty a pigsty with a wattled fence around it she looked surprised and distressed the animation faded out of her face and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent then it was not enchanted aforetime she said in a musing fashion as if to herself and how strange is this marvel and how awful that to the one perception it is enchanted and dight in a base and shameful aspect yet to the perception of the other it is not enchanted hath suffered no change but stands firm and stately still girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air from its towers and god shield us how it pricks the heart to see again these gracious captives and the sorrow deepened in their sweet faces we have tarried along and are to blame i saw my cue the castle was enchanted to me not to her it would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion it couldnt be done i must just humor it so i said this is a common case the enchanting of a thing to one eye and leaving it in its proper form to another you have heard of it before sandy though you havent happened to experience it but no harm is done in fact it is lucky the way it is if these ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves it would be necessary to break the enchantment and that might be impossible if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment and hazardous too for in attempting a disenchantment without the true key you are liable to err and turn your hogs into dogs and the dogs into cats the cats into rats and so on and end by reducing your materials to nothing finally or to an odorless gas which you cant follow which of course amounts to the same thing but here by good luck no ones eyes but mine are under the enchantment and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it these ladies remain ladies to you and to themselves and to everybody else and at the same time they will suffer in no way from my delusion for when i know that an ostensible hog is a lady that is enough for me i know how to treat her thanks oh sweet my lord thou talkest like an angel and i know that thou wilt deliver them for that thou art minded to great deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will and to do as any that is on live i will not leave a princess in the sty sandy are those three yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swine herds the ogres are they changed also it is most wonderful now am i fearful for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible ah go warily fair sir this is a mightier emprise than i wend you be easy sandy all i need to know is how much of an ogre is invisible then i know how to locate his vitals dont you be afraid i will make short work of these bunco steerers stay where you are i left sandy kneeling there corpse faced but plucky and hopeful and rode down to the pigsty and struck up a trade with the swine herds i won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs at the lump sum of sixteen pennies which was rather above latest quotations i was just in time for the church the lord of the manor and the rest of the tax gatherers would have been along next day and swept off pretty much all the stock leaving the swine herds very short of hogs and sandy out of princesses but now the tax people could be paid in cash and there would be a stake left besides one of the men had ten children and he said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took the fattest one for tithes the wife burst out upon him and offered him a child and said thou beast without bowels of mercy why leave me my child yet rob me of the wherewithal to feed it how curious the same thing had happened in the wales of my day under this same old established church which was supposed by many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise i sent the three men away and then opened the sty gate and beckoned sandy to come which she did and not leisurely but with the rush of a prairie fire and when i saw her fling herself upon those hogs with tears of joy running down her cheeks and strain them to her heart and kiss them and caress them and call them reverently by grand princely names i was ashamed of her ashamed of the human race we had to drive those hogs home ten miles and no ladies were ever more fickle minded or contrary they would stay in no road no path they broke out through the brush on all sides and flowed away in all directions over rocks and hills and the roughest places they could find and they must not be struck or roughly accosted sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming their rank the troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called my lady and your highness like the rest it is annoying and difficult to scour around after hogs in armor there was one small countess with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back that was the devil for perversity she gave me a race of an hour over all sorts of country and then we were right where we had started from having made not a rod of real progress i seized her at last by the tail and brought her along squealing when i overtook sandy she was horrified and said it was in the last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train we got the hogs home just at dark most of them the princess nerovens de morganore was missing and two of her ladies in waiting namely miss angela bohun and the demoiselle elaine courtemains the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star in her forehead and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a slight limp in the forward shank on the starboard side a couple of the tryingest blisters to drive that i ever saw also among the missing were several mere baronesses and i wanted them to stay missing but no all that sausage meat had to be found so servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills to that end of course the whole drove was housed in the house and great guns well i never saw anything like it nor ever heard anything like it and never smelt anything like it it was like an insurrection in a gasometer chapter xxi the pilgrims when i did get to bed at last i was unspeakably tired the stretching out and the relaxing of the long tense muscles how luxurious how delicious but that was as far as i could get sleep was out of the question for the present the ripping and tearing and squealing of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium come again and kept me broad awake being awake my thoughts were busy of course and mainly they busied themselves with sandys curious delusion here she was as sane a person as the kingdom could produce and yet from my point of view she was acting like a crazy woman my land the power of training of influence of education it can bring a body up to believe anything i had to put myself in sandys place to realize that she was not a lunatic yes and put her in mine to demonstrate how easy it is to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have been taught if i had told sandy i had seen a wagon uninfluenced by enchantment spin along fifty miles an hour had seen a man unequipped with magic powers get into a basket and soar out of sight among the clouds and had listened without any necromancers help to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles away sandy would not merely have supposed me to be crazy she would have thought she knew it everybody around her believed in enchantments nobody had any doubts to doubt that a castle could be turned into a sty and its occupants into hogs would have been the same as my doubting among connecticut people the actuality of the telephone and its wonders and in both cases would be absolute proof of a diseased mind an unsettled reason yes sandy was sane that must be admitted if i also would be sane to sandy i must keep my superstitions about unenchanted and unmiraculous locomotives balloons and telephones to myself also i believed that the world was not flat and hadnt pillars under it to support it nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that occupied all space above but as i was the only person in the kingdom afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions i recognized that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter too if i did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody as a madman the next morning sandy assembled the swine in the dining room and gave them their breakfast waiting upon them personally and manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of her island ancient and modern have always felt for rank let its outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may i could have eaten with the hogs if i had had birth approaching my lofty official rank but i hadnt and so accepted the unavoidable slight and made no complaint sandy and i had our breakfast at the second table the family were not at home i said how many are in the family sandy and where do they keep themselves family yes which family good my lord why this family your own family sooth to say i understand you not i have no family no family why sandy isnt this your home now how indeed might that be i have no home well then whose house is this ah wit you well i would tell you an i knew myself come you dont even know these people then who invited us here none invited us we but came that is all why woman this is a most extraordinary performance the effrontery of it is beyond admiration we blandly march into a mans house and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility the sun has yet discovered in the earth and then it turns out that we dont even know the mans name how did you ever venture to take this extravagant liberty i supposed of course it was your home what will the man say what will he say forsooth what can he say but give thanks thanks for what her face was filled with a puzzled surprise verily thou troublest mine understanding with strange words do ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice in his life to entertain company such as we have brought to grace his house withal well no when you come to that no its an even bet that this is the first time he has had a treat like this then let him be thankful and manifest the same by grateful speech and due humility he were a dog else and the heir and ancestor of dogs to my mind the situation was uncomfortable it might become more so it might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on so i said the day is wasting sandy it is time to get the nobility together and be moving wherefore fair sir and boss we want to take them to their home dont we la but list to him they be of all the regions of the earth each must hie to her own home wend you we might do all these journeys in one so brief life as he hath appointed that created life and thereto death likewise with help of adam who by sin done through persuasion of his helpmeet she being wrought upon and bewrayed by the beguilements of the great enemy of man that serpent hight satan aforetime consecrated and set apart unto that evil work by overmastering spite and envy begotten in his heart through fell ambitions that did blight and mildew a nature erst so white and pure whenso it hove with the shining multitudes its brethren born in glade and shade of that fair heaven wherein all such as native be to that rich estate and great scott my lord well you know we havent got time for this sort of thing dont you see we could distribute these people around the earth in less time than it is going to take you to explain that we cant we mustnt talk now we must act you want to be careful you mustnt let your mill get the start of you that way at a time like this to business now and sharps the word who is to take the aristocracy home even their friends these will come for them from the far parts of the earth this was lightning from a clear sky for unexpectedness and the relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner she would remain to deliver the goods of course well then sandy as our enterprise is handsomely and successfully ended i will go home and report and if ever another one i also am ready i will go with thee this was recalling the pardon how you will go with me why should you will i be traitor to my knight dost think that were dishonor i may not part from thee until in knightly encounter in the field some overmatching champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me i were to blame an i thought that that might ever hap elected for the long term i sighed to myself i may as well make the best of it so then i spoke up and said all right let us make a start while she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork i gave that whole peerage away to the servants and i asked them to take a duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly lodged and promenaded but they considered that that would be hardly worth while and would moreover be a rather grave departure from custom and therefore likely to make talk a departure from custom that settled it it was a nation capable of committing any crime but that the servants said they would follow the fashion a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance they would scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls and then the evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible it was a kind of satire on nature it was the scientific method the geologic method it deposited the history of the family in a stratified record and the antiquary could dig through it and tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family had introduced successively for a hundred years the first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims it was not going our way but we joined it nevertheless for it was hourly being borne in upon me now that if i would govern this country wisely i must be posted in the details of its life and not at second hand but by personal observation and scrutiny this company of pilgrims resembled chaucers in this that it had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions the country could show and a corresponding variety of costume there were young men and old men young women and old women lively folk and grave folk they rode upon mules and horses and there was not a side saddle in the party for this specialty was to remain unknown in england for nine hundred years yet it was a pleasant friendly sociable herd pious happy merry and full of unconscious coarsenesses and innocent indecencies what they regarded as the merry tale went the continual round and caused no more embarrassment than it would have caused in the best english society twelve centuries later practical jokes worthy of the english wits of the first quarter of the far off nineteenth century were sprung here and there and yonder along the line and compelled the delightedest applause and sometimes when a bright remark was made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward the other you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake sandy knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage and she posted me she said they journey to the valley of holiness for to be blessed of the godly hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleansed from sin where is this watering place it lieth a two day journey hence by the borders of the land that hight the cuckoo kingdom tell me about it is it a celebrated place oh of a truth yes there be none more so of old time there lived there an abbot and his monks belike were none in the world more holy than these for they gave themselves to study of pious books and spoke not the one to the other or indeed to any and ate decayed herbs and naught thereto and slept hard and prayed much and washed never also they wore the same garment until it fell from their bodies through age and decay right so came they to be known of all the world by reason of these holy austerities and visited by rich and poor and reverenced proceed but always there was lack of water there whereas upon a time the holy abbot prayed and for answer a great stream of clear water burst forth by miracle in a desert place now were the fickle monks tempted of the fiend and they wrought with their abbot unceasingly by beggings and beseechings that he would construct a bath and when he was become aweary and might not resist more he said have ye your will then and granted that they asked now mark thou what tis to forsake the ways of purity the which he loveth and wanton with such as be worldly and an offense these monks did enter into the bath and come thence washed as white as snow and lo in that moment his sign appeared in miraculous rebuke for his insulted waters ceased to flow and utterly vanished away they fared mildly sandy considering how that kind of crime is regarded in this country belike but it was their first sin and they had been of perfect life for long and differing in naught from the angels prayers tears torturings of the flesh all was vain to beguile that water to flow again even processions even burnt offerings even votive candles to the virgin did fail every each of them and all in the land did marvel how odd to find that even this industry has its financial panics and at times sees its assignats and greenbacks languish to zero and everything come to a standstill go on sandy and so upon a time after year and day the good abbot made humble surrender and destroyed the bath and behold his anger was in that moment appeased and the waters gushed richly forth again and even unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure then i take it nobody has washed since he that would essay it could have his halter free yes and swiftly would he need it too the community has prospered since even from that very day the fame of the miracle went abroad into all lands from every land came monks to join they came even as the fishes come in shoals and the monastery added building to building and yet others to these and so spread wide its arms and took them in and nuns came also and more again and yet more and built over against the monastery on the yon side of the vale and added building to building until mighty was that nunnery and these were friendly unto those and they joined their loving labors together and together they built a fair great foundling asylum midway of the valley between you spoke of some hermits sandy these have gathered there from the ends of the earth a hermit thriveth best where there be multitudes of pilgrims ye shall not find no hermit of no sort wanting if any shall mention a hermit of a kind he thinketh new and not to be found but in some far strange land let him but scratch among the holes and caves and swamps that line that valley of holiness and whatsoever be his breed it skills not he shall find a sample of it there i closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good humored face purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further crumbs of fact but i had hardly more than scraped acquaintance with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up in the immemorial way to that same old anecdote the one sir dinadan told me what time i got into trouble with sir sagramor and was challenged of him on account of it i excused myself and dropped to the rear of the procession sad at heart willing to go hence from this troubled life this vale of tears this brief day of broken rest of cloud and storm of weary struggle and monotonous defeat and yet shrinking from the change as remembering how long eternity is and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims but in this one was no merriment no jokes no laughter no playful ways nor any happy giddiness whether of youth or age yet both were here both age and youth gray old men and women strong men and women of middle age young husbands young wives little boys and girls and three babies at the breast even the children were smileless there was not a face among all these half a hundred people but was cast down and bore that set expression of hopelessness which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with despair they were slaves chains led from their fettered feet and their manacled hands to a sole leather belt about their waists and all except the children were also linked together in a file six feet apart by a single chain which led from collar to collar all down the line they were on foot and had tramped three hundred miles in eighteen days upon the cheapest odds and ends of food and stingy rations of that they had slept in these chains every night bundled together like swine they had upon their bodies some poor rags but they could not be said to be clothed their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and made sores which were ulcerated and wormy their naked feet were torn and none walked without a limp originally there had been a hundred of these unfortunates but about half had been sold on the trip the trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into several knotted tails at the end with this whip he cut the shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain and straightened them up he did not speak the whip conveyed his desire without that none of these poor creatures looked up as we rode along by they showed no consciousness of our presence and they made no sound but one that was the dull and awful clank of their chains from end to end of the long file as forty three burdened feet rose and fell in unison the file moved in a cloud of its own making all these faces were gray with a coating of dust one has seen the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses and has written his idle thought in it with his finger i was reminded of this when i noticed the faces of some of those women young mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom how a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their faces plain to see and lord how plain to read for it was the track of tears one of these young mothers was but a girl and it hurt me to the heart to read that writing and reflect that it was come up out of the breast of such a child a breast that ought not to know trouble yet but only the gladness of the morning of life and no doubt she reeled just then giddy with fatigue and down came the lash and flicked a flake of skin from her naked shoulder it stung me as if i had been hit instead the master halted the file and jumped from his horse he stormed and swore at this girl and said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness and as this was the last chance he should have he would settle the account now she dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg and cry and implore in a passion of terror but the master gave no attention he snatched the child from her and then made the men slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there and expose her body and then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed she shrieking and struggling the while piteously one of the men who was holding her turned away his face and for this humanity he was reviled and flogged all our pilgrims looked on and commented on the expert way in which the whip was handled they were too much hardened by lifelong everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything else in the exhibition that invited comment this was what slavery could do in the way of ossifying what one may call the superior lobe of human feeling for these pilgrims were kind hearted people and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that i wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free but that would not do i must not interfere too much and get myself a name for riding over the countrys laws and the citizens rights roughshod if i lived and prospered i would be the death of slavery that i was resolved upon but i would try to fix it so that when i became its executioner it should be by command of the nation just here was the wayside shop of a smith and now arrived a landed proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back deliverable here where her irons could be taken off they were removed then there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to which should pay the blacksmith the moment the girl was delivered from her irons she flung herself all tears and frantic sobbings into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she was whipped he strained her to his breast and smothered her face and the childs with kisses and washed them with the rain of his tears i suspected i inquired yes i was right it was husband and wife they had to be torn apart by force the girl had to be dragged away and she struggled and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight and even after that we could still make out the fading plaint of those receding shrieks and the husband and father with his wife and child gone never to be seen by him again in life well the look of him one might not bear at all and so i turned away but i knew i should never get his picture out of my mind again and there it is to this day to wring my heartstrings whenever i think of it we put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall and when i rose next morning and looked abroad i was ware where a knight came riding in the golden glory of the new day and recognized him for knight of mine sir ozana le cure hardy he was in the gentlemens furnishing line and his missionarying specialty was plug hats he was clothed all in steel in the beautifulest armor of the time up to where his helmet ought to have been but he hadnt any helmet he wore a shiny stove pipe hat and was ridiculous a spectacle as one might want to see it was another of my surreptitious schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it grotesque and absurd sir ozanas saddle was hung about with leather hat boxes and every time he overcame a wandering knight he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made him wear it i dressed and ran down to welcome sir ozana and get his news how is trade i asked ye will note that i have but these four left yet were they sixteen whenas i got me from camelot why you have certainly done nobly sir ozana where have you been foraging of late i am but now come from the valley of holiness please you sir i am pointed for that place myself is there anything stirring in the monkery more than common by the mass ye may not question it give him good feed boy and stint it not an thou valuest thy crown so get ye lightly to the stable and do even as i bid sir it is parlous news i bring and be these pilgrims then ye may not do better good folk than gather and hear the tale i have to tell sith it concerneth you forasmuch as ye go to find that ye will not find and seek that ye will seek in vain my life being hostage for my word and my word and message being these namely that a hap has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once this two hundred years which was the first and last time that that said misfortune strake the holy valley in that form by commandment of the most high whereto by reasons just and causes thereunto contributing wherein the matter the miraculous fount hath ceased to flow this shout burst from twenty pilgrim mouths at once ye say well good people i was verging to it even when ye spake has somebody been washing again nay it is suspected but none believe it it is thought to be some other sin but none wit what how are they feeling about the calamity none may describe it in words the fount is these nine days dry the prayers that did begin then and the lamentations in sackcloth and ashes and the holy processions none of these have ceased nor night nor day and so the monks and the nuns and the foundlings be all exhausted and do hang up prayers writ upon parchment sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice and at last they sent for thee sir boss to try magic and enchantment and if you could not come then was the messenger to fetch merlin and he is there these three days now and saith he will fetch that water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish it and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his hellions to hie them hither and help but not a whiff of moisture hath he started yet even so much as might qualify as mist upon a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he sweateth betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task and if ye breakfast was ready as soon as it was over i showed to sir ozana these words which i had written on the inside of his hat chemical department laboratory extension section g pxxp send two of first size two of no and six of no together with the proper complementary details and two of my trained assistants and i said now get you to camelot as fast as you can fly brave knight and show the writing to clarence and tell him to have these required matters in the valley of holiness with all possible dispatch i will well sir boss and he was off chapter xxii the holy fountain the pilgrims were human beings otherwise they would have acted differently they had come a long and difficult journey and now when the journey was nearly finished and they learned that the main thing they had come for had ceased to exist they didnt do as horses or cats or angle worms would probably have done turn back and get at something profitable no anxious as they had before been to see the miraculous fountain they were as much as forty times as anxious now to see the place where it had used to be there is no accounting for human beings we made good time and a couple of hours before sunset we stood upon the high confines of the valley of holiness and our eyes swept it from end to end and noted its features that is its large features these were the three masses of buildings they were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert and was such a scene is always mournful it is so impressively still and looks so steeped in death but there was a sound here which interrupted the stillness only to add to its mournfulness this was the faint far sound of tolling bells which floated fitfully to us on the passing breeze and so faintly so softly that we hardly knew whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits we reached the monastery before dark and there the males were given lodging but the women were sent over to the nunnery the bells were close at hand now and their solemn booming smote upon the ear like a message of doom a superstitious despair possessed the heart of every monk and published itself in his ghastly face everywhere these black robed soft sandaled tallow visaged specters appeared flitted about and disappeared noiseless as the creatures of a troubled dream and as uncanny the old abbots joy to see me was pathetic even to tears but he did the shedding himself he said delay not son but get to thy saving work an we bring not the water back again and soon we are ruined and the good work of two hundred years must end and see thou do it with enchantments that be holy for the church will not endure that work in her cause be done by devils magic when i work father be sure there will be no devils work connected with it i shall use no arts that come of the devil and no elements not created by the hand of god but is merlin working strictly on pious lines ah he said he would my son he said he would and took oath to make his promise good well in that case let him proceed but surely you will not sit idle by but help it will not answer to mix methods father neither would it be professional courtesy two of a trade must not underbid each other we might as well cut rates and be done with it it would arrive at that in the end merlin has the contract no other magician can touch it till he throws it up but i will take it from him it is a terrible emergency and the act is thereby justified and if it were not so who will give law to the church the church giveth law to all and what she wills to do that she may do hurt whom it may i will take it from him you shall begin upon the moment it may not be father no doubt as you say where power is supreme one can do as one likes and suffer no injury but we poor magicians are not so situated merlin is a very good magician in a small way and has quite a neat provincial reputation he is struggling along doing the best he can and it would not be etiquette for me to take his job until he himself abandons it the abbots face lighted ah that is simple there are ways to persuade him to abandon it no no father it skills not as these people say if he were persuaded against his will he would load that well with a malicious enchantment which would balk me until i found out its secret it might take a month i could set up a little enchantment of mine which i call the telephone and he could not find out its secret in a hundred years yes you perceive he might block me for a month would you like to risk a month in a dry time like this a month the mere thought of it maketh me to shudder have it thy way my son but my heart is heavy with this disappointment leave me and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting even as i have done these ten long days counterfeiting thus the thing that is called rest the prone body making outward sign of repose where inwardly is none of course it would have been best all round for merlin to waive etiquette and quit and call it half a day since he would never be able to start that water for he was a true magician of the time which is to say the big miracles the ones that gave him his reputation always had the luck to be performed when nobody but merlin was present he couldnt start this well with all this crowd around to see a crowd was as bad for a magicians miracle in that day as it was for a spiritualists miracle in mine there was sure to be some skeptic on hand to turn up the gas at the crucial moment and spoil everything but i did not want merlin to retire from the job until i was ready to take hold of it effectively myself and i could not do that until i got my things from camelot and that would take two or three days my presence gave the monks hope and cheered them up a good deal insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time in ten days as soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced with food their spirits began to rise fast when the mead began to go round they rose faster by the time everybody was half seas over the holy community was in good shape to make a night of it so we stayed by the board and put it through on that line matters got to be very jolly good old questionable stories were told that made the tears run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round bellies shake with laughter and questionable songs were bellowed out in a mighty chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells at last i ventured a story myself and vast was the success of it not right off of course for the native of those islands does not as a rule dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous thing but the fifth time i told it they began to crack in places the eight time i told it they began to crumble at the twelfth repetition they fell apart in chunks and at the fifteenth they disintegrated and i got a broom and swept them up this language is figurative those islanders well they are slow pay at first in the matter of return for your investment of effort but in the end they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast i was at the well next day betimes merlin was there enchanting away like a beaver but not raising the moisture he was not in a pleasant humor and every time i hinted that perhaps this contract was a shade too hefty for a novice he unlimbered his tongue and cursed like a bishop french bishop of the regency days i mean matters were about as i expected to find them the fountain was an ordinary well it had been dug in the ordinary way and stoned up in the ordinary way there was no miracle about it even the lie that had created its reputation was not miraculous i could have told it myself with one hand tied behind me the well was in a dark chamber which stood in the center of a cut stone chapel whose walls were hung with pious pictures of a workmanship that would have made a chromo feel good pictures historically commemorative of curative miracles which had been achieved by the waters when nobody was looking that is nobody but angels they are always on deck when there is a miracle to the fore so as to get put in the picture perhaps angels are as fond of that as a fire company look at the old masters the well chamber was dimly lighted by lamps the water was drawn with a windlass and chain by monks and poured into troughs which delivered it into stone reservoirs outside in the chapel when there was water to draw i mean and none but monks could enter the well chamber i entered it for i had temporary authority to do so by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate but he hadnt entered it himself he did everything by incantations he never worked his intellect if he had stepped in there and used his eyes instead of his disordered mind he could have cured the well by natural means and then turned it into a miracle in the customary way but no he was an old numskull a magician who believed in his own magic and no magician can thrive who is handicapped with a superstition like that i had an idea that the well had sprung a leak that some of the wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that allowed the water to escape i measured the chain feet then i called in a couple of monks locked the door took a candle and made them lower me in the bucket when the chain was all paid out the candle confirmed my suspicion a considerable section of the wall was gone exposing a good big fissure i almost regretted that my theory about the wells trouble was correct because i had another one that had a showy point or two about it for a miracle i remembered that in america many centuries later when an oil well ceased to flow they used to blast it out with a dynamite torpedo if i should find this well dry and no explanation of it i could astonish these people most nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite bomb into it it was my idea to appoint merlin however it was plain that there was no occasion for the bomb one cannot have everything the way he would like it a man has no business to be depressed by a disappointment anyway he ought to make up his mind to get even that is what i did i said to myself i am in no hurry i can wait that bomb will come good yet and it did too when i was above ground again i turned out the monks and let down a fish line the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep and there was forty one feet of water in it i called in a monk and asked how deep is the well that sir i wit not having never been told how does the water usually stand in it near to the top these two centuries as the testimony goeth brought down to us through our predecessors it was true as to recent times at least for there was witness to it and better witness than a monk only about twenty or thirty feet of the chain showed wear and use the rest of it was unworn and rusty what had happened when the well gave out that other time without doubt some practical person had come along and mended the leak and then had come up and told the abbot he had discovered by divination that if the sinful bath were destroyed the well would flow again the leak had befallen again now and these children would have prayed and processioned and tolled their bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blew away and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to drop a fish line into the well or go down in it and find out what was really the matter old habit of mind is one of the toughest things to get away from in the world it transmits itself like physical form and feature and for a man in those days to have had an idea that his ancestors hadnt had would have brought him under suspicion of being illegitimate i said to the monk it is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well but we will try if my brother merlin fails brother merlin is a very passable artist but only in the parlor magic line and he may not succeed in fact is not likely to succeed but that should be nothing to his discredit the man that can do this kind of miracle knows enough to keep hotel hotel i mind not to have heard of hotel its what you call hostel the man that can do this miracle can keep hostel i can do this miracle i shall do this miracle yet i do not try to conceal from you that it is a miracle to tax the occult powers to the last strain none knoweth that truth better than the brotherhood indeed for it is of record that aforetime it was parlous difficult and took a year natheless god send you good success and to that end will we pray as a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around that the thing was difficult many a small thing has been made large by the right kind of advertising that monk was filled up with the difficulty of this enterprise he would fill up the others in two days the solicitude would be booming on my way home at noon i met sandy she had been sampling the hermits i said i would like to do that myself this is wednesday is there a matinee a which please you sir matinee do they keep open afternoons who the hermits of course keep open yes keep open isnt that plain enough do they knock off at noon knock off knock off yes knock off what is the matter with knock off i never saw such a dunderhead cant you understand anything at all in plain terms do they shut up shop draw the game bank the fires shut up shop draw there never mind let it go you make me tired you cant seem to understand the simplest thing i would i might please thee sir and it is to me dole and sorrow that i fail albeit sith i am but a simple damsel and taught of none being from the cradle unbaptized in those deep waters of learning that do anoint with a sovereignty him that partaketh of that most noble sacrament investing him with reverend state to the mental eye of the humble mortal who by bar and lack of that great consecration seeth in his own unlearned estate but a symbol of that other sort of lack and loss which men do publish to the pitying eye with sackcloth trappings whereon the ashes of grief do lie bepowdered and bestrewn and so when such shall in the darkness of his mind encounter these golden phrases of high mystery these shut up shops and draw the game and bank the fires it is but by the grace of god that he burst not for envy of the mind that can beget and tongue that can deliver so great and mellow sounding miracles of speech and if there do ensue confusion in that humbler mind and failure to divine the meanings of these wonders then if so be this miscomprehension is not vain but sooth and true wit ye well it is the very substance of worshipful dear homage and may not lightly be misprized nor had been an ye had noted this complexion of mood and mind and understood that that i would i could not and that i could not i might not nor yet nor might nor could nor might not nor could not might be by advantage turned to the desired would and so i pray you mercy of my fault and that ye will of your kindness and your charity forgive it good my master and most dear lord i couldnt make it all out that is the details but i got the general idea and enough of it too to be ashamed it was not fair to spring those nineteenth century technicalities upon the untutored infant of the sixth and then rail at her because she couldnt get their drift and when she was making the honest best drive at it she could too and no fault of hers that she couldnt fetch the home plate and so i apologized then we meandered pleasantly away toward the hermit holes in sociable converse together and better friends than ever i was gradually coming to have a mysterious and shuddery reverence for this girl nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station and got her train fairly started on one of those horizonless transcontinental sentences of hers it was borne in upon me that i was standing in the awful presence of the mother of the german language i was so impressed with this that sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences on me i unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence and stood uncovered and if words had been water i had been drowned sure she had exactly the german way whatever was in her mind to be delivered whether a mere remark or a sermon or a cyclopedia or the history of a war she would get it into a single sentence or die whenever the literary german dives into a sentence that is the last you are going to see of him till he emerges on the other side of his atlantic with his verb in his mouth we drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon it was a most strange menagerie the chief emulation among them seemed to be to see which could manage to be the uncleanest and most prosperous with vermin their manner and attitudes were the last expression of complacent self righteousness it was one anchorites pride to lie naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister him unmolested it was anothers to lean against a rock all day long conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims and pray it was anothers to go naked and crawl around on all fours it was anothers to drag about with him year in and year out eighty pounds of iron it was anothers to never lie down when he slept but to stand among the thorn bushes and snore when there were pilgrims around to look a woman who had the white hair of age and no other apparel was black from crown to heel with forty seven years of holy abstinence from water groups of gazing pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects lost in reverent wonder and envious of the fleckless sanctity which these pious austerities had won for them from an exacting heaven by and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones he was a mighty celebrity his fame had penetrated all christendom the noble and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe to pay him reverence his stand was in the center of the widest part of the valley and it took all that space to hold his crowds his stand was a pillar sixty feet high with a broad platform on the top of it he was now doing what he had been doing every day for twenty years up there bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly almost to his feet it was his way of praying i timed him with a stop watch and he made revolutions in minutes and seconds it seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste it was one of the most useful motions in mechanics the pedal movement so i made a note in my memorandum book purposing some day to apply a system of elastic cords to him and run a sewing machine with it i afterward carried out that scheme and got five years good service out of him in which time he turned out upward of eighteen thousand first rate tow linen shirts which was ten a day i worked him sundays and all he was going sundays the same as week days and it was no use to waste the power these shirts cost me nothing but just the mere trifle for the materials i furnished those myself it would not have been right to make him do that and they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a dollar and a half apiece which was the price of fifty cows or a blooded race horse in arthurdom they were regarded as a perfect protection against sin and advertised as such by my knights everywhere with the paint pot and stencil plate insomuch that there was not a cliff or a bowlder or a dead wall in england but you could read on it at a mile distance buy the only genuine st stylite patronized by the nobility patent applied for there was more money in the business than one knew what to do with as it extended i brought out a line of goods suitable for kings and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort with ruffles down the forehatch and the running gear clewed up with a featherstitch to leeward and then hauled aft with a back stay and triced up with a half turn in the standing rigging forward of the weather gaskets yes it was a daisy but about that time i noticed that the motive power had taken to standing on one leg and i found that there was something the matter with the other one so i stocked the business and unloaded taking sir bors de ganis into camp financially along with certain of his friends for the works stopped within a year and the good saint got him to his rest but he had earned it i can say that for him when i saw him that first time however his personal condition will not quite bear description here you can read it in the lives of the saints all the details concerning the hermits in this chapter are from lecky but greatly modified this book not being a history but only a tale the majority of the historians frank details were too strong for reproduction in it editor chapter xxiii restoration of the fountain saturday noon i went to the well and looked on a while merlin was still burning smoke powders and pawing the air and muttering gibberish as hard as ever but looking pretty down hearted for of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet finally i said how does the thing promise by this time partner behold i am even now busied with trial of the powerfulest enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands of the east an it fail me naught can avail peace until i finish he raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region and must have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits for the wind was their way and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and billowy fog he poured out volumes of speech to match and contorted his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary way at the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting and about exhausted now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks and nuns and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of acres of foundlings all drawn by the prodigious smoke and all in a grand state of excitement the abbot inquired anxiously for results merlin said if any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these waters this which i have but just essayed had done it it has failed whereby i do now know that that which i had feared is a truth established the sign of this failure is that the most potent spirit known to the magicians of the east and whose name none may utter and live has laid his spell upon this well the mortal does not breathe nor ever will who can penetrate the secret of that spell and without that secret none can break it the water will flow no more forever good father i have done what man could suffer me to go of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation he turned to me with the signs of it in his face and said ye have heard him is it true part of it is not all then not all what part is true that that spirit with the russian name has put his spell upon the well gods wounds then are we ruined possibly but not certainly ye mean not certainly that is it wherefore ye also mean that when he saith none can break the spell yes when he says that he says what isnt necessarily true there are conditions under which an effort to break it may have some chance that is some small some trifling chance of success the conditions oh they are nothing difficult only these i want the well and the surroundings for the space of half a mile entirely to myself from sunset to day until i remove the ban and nobody allowed to cross the ground but by my authority are these all yes and you have no fear to try oh none one may fail of course and one may also succeed one can try and i am ready to chance it i have my conditions these and all others ye may name i will issue commandment to that effect wait said merlin with an evil smile ye wit that he that would break this spell must know that spirits name yes i know his name and wit you also that to know it skills not of itself but ye must likewise pronounce it ha ha knew ye that yes i knew that too you had that knowledge art a fool are ye minded to utter that name and die utter it why certainly i would utter it if it was welsh ye are even a dead man then and i go to tell arthur thats all right take your gripsack and get along the thing for you to do is to go home and work the weather john w merlin it was a home shot and it made him wince for he was the worst weather failure in the kingdom whenever he ordered up the danger signals along the coast there was a weeks dead calm sure and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained brickbats but i kept him in the weather bureau right along to undermine his reputation however that shot raised his bile and instead of starting home to report my death he said he would remain and enjoy it my two experts arrived in the evening and pretty well fagged for they had traveled double tides they had pack mules along and had brought everything i needed tools pump lead pipe greek fire sheaves of big rockets roman candles colored fire sprays electric apparatus and a lot of sundries everything necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle they got their supper and a nap and about midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed the required conditions we took possession of the well and its surroundings my boys were experts in all sorts of things from the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical instrument an hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in ship shape fashion and the water began to rise then we stowed our fireworks in the chapel locked up the place and went home to bed before the noon mass was over we were at the well again for there was a deal to do yet and i was determined to spring the miracle before midnight for business reasons for whereas a miracle worked for the church on a week day is worth a good deal it is worth six times as much if you get it in on a sunday in nine hours the water had risen to its customary level that is to say it was within twenty three feet of the top we put in a little iron pump one of the first turned out by my works near the capital we bored into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the well chamber and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond the threshold where the gushing water would be visible to the two hundred and fifty acres of people i was intending should be present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at the proper time we knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel where we clamped it down fast poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the bottom then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they could loosely stand all the different breeds of rockets there are and they made a portly and imposing sheaf i can tell you we grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder we placed a whole magazine of greek fire on each corner of the roof blue on one corner green on another red on another and purple on the last and grounded a wire in each about two hundred yards off in the flat we built a pen of scantlings about four feet high and laid planks on it and so made a platform we covered it with swell tapestries borrowed for the occasion and topped it off with the abbots own throne when you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race you want to get in every detail that will count you want to make all the properties impressive to the public eye you want to make matters comfortable for your head guest then you can turn yourself loose and play your effects for all they are worth i know the value of these things for i know human nature you cant throw too much style into a miracle it costs trouble and work and sometimes money but it pays in the end well we brought the wires to the ground at the chapel and then brought them under the ground to the platform and hid the batteries there we put a rope fence a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common multitude and that finished the work my idea was doors open at performance to begin at sharp i wished i could charge admission but of course that wouldnt answer i instructed my boys to be in the chapel as early as before anybody was around and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time and make the fur fly then we went home to supper the news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had been pouring into the valley the lower end of the valley was become one huge camp we should have a good house no question about that criers went the rounds early in the evening and announced the coming attempt which put every pulse up to fever heat they gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would move in state and occupy the platform at up to which time all the region which was under my ban must be clear the bells would then cease from tolling and this sign should be permission to the multitudes to close in and take their places i was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the abbots solemn procession hove in sight which it did not do till it was nearly to the rope fence because it was a starless black night and no torches permitted with it came merlin and took a front seat on the platform he was as good as his word for once one could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban but they were there just the same the moment the bells stopped those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast black wave and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow and then it solidified itself and you could have walked upon a pavement of human heads to well miles we had a solemn stage wait now for about twenty minutes a thing i had counted on for effect it is always good to let your audience have a chance to work up its expectancy at length out of the silence a noble latin chant mens voices broke and swelled up and rolled away into the night a majestic tide of melody i had put that up too and it was one of the best effects i ever invented when it was finished i stood up on the platform and extended my hands abroad for two minutes with my face uplifted that always produces a dead hush and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word with a kind of awfulness which caused hundreds to tremble and many women to faint constantinopolitanischerdudelsackspfeifenmachersgesellschafft just as i was moaning out the closing hunks of that word i touched off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare it was immense that effect lots of people shrieked women curled up and quit in every direction foundlings collapsed by platoons the abbot and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered with agitated prayers merlin held his grip but he was astonished clear down to his corns he had never seen anything to begin with that before now was the time to pile in the effects i lifted my hands and groaned out this word as it were in agony nihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuchungen and turned on the red fire you should have heard that atlantic of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue after sixty seconds i shouted transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreibertrauungsthraenen tragoedie and lit up the green fire after waiting only forty seconds this time i spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating syllables of this word of words mekkamuselmannenmassenmenchenmoerdermohrenmuttermarmormonumentenmacher and whirled on the purple glare there they were all going at once red blue green purple four furious volcanoes pouring vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft and spreading a blinding rainbowed noonday to the furthest confines of that valley in the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid against the background of sky his seesaw stopped for the first time in twenty years i knew the boys were at the pump now and ready so i said to the abbot the time is come father i am about to pronounce the dread name and command the spell to dissolve you want to brace up and take hold of something then i shouted to the people behold in another minute the spell will be broken or no mortal can break it if it break all will know it for you will see the sacred water gush from the chapel door i stood a few moments to let the hearers have a chance to spread my announcement to those who couldnt hear and so convey it to the furthest ranks then i made a grand exhibition of extra posturing and gesturing and shouted lo i command the fell spirit that possesses the holy fountain to now disgorge into the skies all the infernal fires that still remain in him and straightway dissolve his spell and flee hence to the pit there to lie bound a thousand years by his own dread name i command it bgwjjilligkkk then i touched off the hogshead of rockets and a vast fountain of dazzling lances of fire vomited itself toward the zenith with a hissing rush and burst in mid sky into a storm of flashing jewels one mighty groan of terror started up from the massed people then suddenly broke into a wild hosannah of joy for there fair and plain in the uncanny glare they saw the freed water leaping forth the old abbot could not speak a word for tears and the chokings in his throat without utterance of any sort he folded me in his arms and mashed me it was more eloquent than speech and harder to get over too in a country where there were really no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel you should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down in that water and kiss it kiss it and pet it and fondle it and talk to it as if it were alive and welcome it back with the dear names they gave their darlings just as if it had been a friend who was long gone away and lost and was come home again yes it was pretty to see and made me think more of them than i had done before i sent merlin home on a shutter he had caved in and gone down like a landslide when i pronounced that fearful name and had never come to since he never had heard that name before neither had i but to him it was the right one any jumble would have been the right one he admitted afterward that that spirits own mother could not have pronounced that name better than i did he never could understand how i survived it and i didnt tell him it is only young magicians that give away a secret like that merlin spent three months working enchantments to try to find out the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it but he didnt arrive when i started to the chapel the populace uncovered and fell back reverently to make a wide way for me as if i had been some kind of a superior being and i was i was aware of that i took along a night shift of monks and taught them the mystery of the pump and set them to work for it was plain that a good part of the people out there were going to sit up with the water all night consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted of it to those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle itself and they were full of wonder over it and of admiration too of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance it was a great night an immense night there was reputation in it i could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it chapter xxiv a rival magician my influence in the valley of holiness was something prodigious now it seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable account the thought came to me the next morning and was suggested by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come riding in according to history the monks of this place two centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash it might be that there was a leaven of this unrighteousness still remaining so i sounded a brother wouldnt you like a bath he shuddered at the thought the thought of the peril of it to the well but he said with feeling one needs not to ask that of a poor body who has not known that blessed refreshment sith that he was a boy would god i might wash me but it may not be fair sir tempt me not it is forbidden and then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that i was resolved he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed if it sized up my whole influence and bankrupted the pile so i went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this brother he blenched at the idea i dont mean that you could see him blench for of course you couldnt see it without you scraped him and i didnt care enough about it to scrape him but i knew the blench was there just the same and within a book covers thickness of the surface too blenched and trembled he said ah son ask aught else thou wilt and it is thine and freely granted out of a grateful heart but this oh this would you drive away the blessed water again no father i will not drive it away i have mysterious knowledge which teaches me that there was an error that other time when it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain a large interest began to show up in the old mans face my knowledge informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune which was caused by quite another sort of sin these are brave words but but right welcome if they be true they are true indeed let me build the bath again father let me build it again and the fountain shall flow forever you promise this you promise it say the word say you promise it i do promise it then will i have the first bath myself go get ye to your work tarry not tarry not but go i and my boys were at work straight off the ruins of the old bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery not a stone missing they had been left just so all these lifetimes and avoided with a pious fear as things accursed in two days we had it all done and the water in a spacious pool of clear pure water that a body could swim in it was running water too it came in and went out through the ancient pipes the old abbot kept his word and was the first to try it he went down black and shaky leaving the whole black community above troubled and worried and full of bodings but he came back white and joyful and the game was made another triumph scored it was a good campaign that we made in that valley of holiness and i was very well satisfied and ready to move on now but i struck a disappointment i caught a heavy cold and it started up an old lurking rheumatism of mine of course the rheumatism hunted up my weakest place and located itself there this was the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me what time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace when at last i got out i was a shadow but everybody was full of attentions and kindnesses and these brought cheer back into my life and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly up toward health and strength again so i gained fast sandy was worn out with nursing so i made up my mind to turn out and go a cruise alone leaving her at the nunnery to rest up my idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree and wander through the country a week or two on foot this would give me a chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest class of free citizens on equal terms there was no other way to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation of the laws upon it if i went among them as a gentleman there would be restraints and conventionalities which would shut me out from their private joys and troubles and i should get no further than the outside shell one morning i was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity of the valley when i came upon an artificial opening in the face of a low precipice and recognized it by its location as a hermitage which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den of a hermit of high renown for dirt and austerity i knew he had lately been offered a situation in the great sahara where lions and sandflies made the hermit life peculiarly attractive and difficult and had gone to africa to take possession so i thought i would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed with its reputation my surprise was great the place was newly swept and scoured then there was another surprise back in the gloom of the cavern i heard the clink of a little bell and then this exclamation hello central is this you camelot behold thou mayst glad thy heart an thou hast faith to believe the wonderful when that it cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in impossible places here standeth in the flesh his mightiness the boss and with thine own ears shall ye hear him speak now what a radical reversal of things this was what a jumbling together of extravagant incongruities what a fantastic conjunction of opposites and irreconcilables the home of the bogus miracle become the home of a real one the den of a mediaeval hermit turned into a telephone office the telephone clerk stepped into the light and i recognized one of my young fellows i said how long has this office been established here ulfius but since midnight fair sir boss an it please you we saw many lights in the valley and so judged it well to make a station for that where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town of goodly size quite right it isnt a town in the customary sense but its a good stand anyway do you know where you are of that i have had no time to make inquiry for whenas my comradeship moved hence upon their labors leaving me in charge i got me to needed rest purposing to inquire when i waked and report the places name to camelot for record well this is the valley of holiness it didnt take i mean he didnt start at the name as i had supposed he would he merely said i will so report it why the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late wonders that have happened here you didnt hear of them ah ye will remember we move by night and avoid speech with all we learn naught but that we get by the telephone from camelot why they know all about this thing havent they told you anything about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain oh that indeed yes but the name of this valley doth woundily differ from the name of that one indeed to differ wider were not pos what was that name then the valley of hellishness that explains it confound a telephone anyway it is the very demon for conveying similarities of sound that are miracles of divergence from similarity of sense but no matter you know the name of the place now call up camelot he did it and had clarence sent for it was good to hear my boys voice again it was like being home after some affectionate interchanges and some account of my late illness i said what is new the king and queen and many of the court do start even in this hour to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye have restored and cleanse themselves of sin and see the place where the infernal spirit spouted true hell flames to the clouds an ye listen sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise smile a smile sith twas i that made selection of those flames from out our stock and sent them by your order does the king know the way to this place the king no nor to any other in his realms mayhap but the lads that holp you with your miracle will be his guide and lead the way and appoint the places for rests at noons and sleeps at night this will bring them here when mid afternoon or later the third day anything else in the way of news the king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye suggested to him one regiment is complete and officered the mischief i wanted a main hand in that myself there is only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer a regular army yes and now ye will marvel to know theres not so much as one west pointer in that regiment what are you talking about are you in earnest it is truly as i have said why this makes me uneasy who were chosen and what was the method competitive examination indeed i know naught of the method i but know this these officers be all of noble family and are born what is it you call it chuckleheads theres something wrong clarence comfort yourself then for two candidates for a lieutenancy do travel hence with the king young nobles both and if you but wait where you are you will hear them questioned that is news to the purpose i will get one west pointer in anyway mount a man and send him to that school with a message let him kill horses if necessary but he must be there before sunset to night and say there is no need i have laid a ground wire to the school prithee let me connect you with it it sounded good in this atmosphere of telephones and lightning communication with distant regions i was breathing the breath of life again after long suffocation i realized then what a creepy dull inanimate horror this land had been to me all these years and how i had been in such a stifled condition of mind as to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it i gave my order to the superintendent of the academy personally i also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and a box or so of safety matches i was getting tired of doing without these conveniences i could have them now as i wasnt going to wear armor any more at present and therefore could get at my pockets when i got back to the monastery i found a thing of interest going on the abbot and his monks were assembled in the great hall observing with childish wonder and faith the performances of a new magician a fresh arrival his dress was the extreme of the fantastic as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an indian medicine man wears he was mowing and mumbling and gesticulating and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floor the regular thing you know he was a celebrity from asia so he said and that was enough that sort of evidence was as good as gold and passed current everywhere how easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellows terms his specialty was to tell you what any individual on the face of the globe was doing at the moment and what he had done at any time in the past and what he would do at any time in the future he asked if any would like to know what the emperor of the east was doing now the sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing of hands made eloquent answer this reverend crowd would like to know what that monarch was at just as this moment the fraud went through some more mummery and then made grave announcement the high and mighty emperor of the east doth at this moment put money in the palm of a holy begging friar one two three pieces and they be all of silver a buzz of admiring exclamations broke out all around it is marvelous wonderful what study what labor to have acquired a so amazing power as this would they like to know what the supreme lord of inde was doing yes he told them what the supreme lord of inde was doing then he told them what the sultan of egypt was at also what the king of the remote seas was about and so on and so on and with each new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher they thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time but no he never had to hesitate he always knew and always with unerring precision i saw that if this thing went on i should lose my supremacy this fellow would capture my following i should be left out in the cold i must put a cog in his wheel and do it right away too i said if i might ask i should very greatly like to know what a certain person is doing speak and freely i will tell you it will be difficult perhaps impossible my art knoweth not that word the more difficult it is the more certainly will i reveal it to you you see i was working up the interest it was getting pretty high too you could see that by the craning necks all around and the half suspended breathing so now i climaxed it if you make no mistake if you tell me truly what i want to know i will give you two hundred silver pennies the fortune is mine i will tell you what you would know then tell me what i am doing with my right hand ah h there was a general gasp of surprise it had not occurred to anybody in the crowd that simple trick of inquiring about somebody who wasnt ten thousand miles away the magician was hit hard it was an emergency that had never happened in his experience before and it corked him he didnt know how to meet it he looked stunned confused he couldnt say a word come i said what are you waiting for is it possible you can answer up right off and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is doing and yet cant tell what a person is doing who isnt three yards from you persons behind me know what i am doing with my right hand they will indorse you if you tell correctly he was still dumb very well i ll tell you why you dont speak up and tell it is because you dont know you a magician good friends this tramp is a mere fraud and liar this distressed the monks and terrified them they were not used to hearing these awful beings called names and they did not know what might be the consequence there was a dead silence now superstitious bodings were in every mind the magician began to pull his wits together and when he presently smiled an easy nonchalant smile it spread a mighty relief around for it indicated that his mood was not destructive he said it hath struck me speechless the frivolity of this persons speech let all know if perchance there be any who know it not that enchanters of my degree deign not to concern themselves with the doings of any but kings princes emperors them that be born in the purple and them only had ye asked me what arthur the great king is doing it were another matter and i had told ye but the doings of a subject interest me not oh i misunderstood you i thought you said anybody and so i supposed anybody included well anybody that is everybody it doth anybody that is of lofty birth and the better if he be royal that it meseemeth might well be said the abbot who saw his opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster for it were not likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be born near to the summits of greatness our arthur the king would you know of him broke in the enchanter most gladly yea and gratefully everybody was full of awe and interest again right away the incorrigible idiots they watched the incantations absorbingly and looked at me with a there now what can you say to that air when the announcement came the king is weary with the chase and lieth in his palace these two hours sleeping a dreamless sleep gods benison upon him said the abbot and crossed himself may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul and so it might be if he were sleeping i said but the king is not sleeping the king rides here was trouble again a conflict of authority nobody knew which of us to believe i still had some reputation left the magicians scorn was stirred and he said lo i have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and magicians in my life days but none before that could sit idle and see to the heart of things with never an incantation to help you have lived in the woods and lost much by it i use incantations myself as this good brotherhood are aware but only on occasions of moment when it comes to sarcasming i reckon i know how to keep my end up that jab made this fellow squirm the abbot inquired after the queen and the court and got this information they be all on sleep being overcome by fatigue like as to the king i said that is merely another lie half of them are about their amusements the queen and the other half are not sleeping they ride now perhaps you can spread yourself a little and tell us where the king and queen and all that are this moment riding with them are going they sleep now as i said but on the morrow they will ride for they go a journey toward the sea and where will they be the day after to morrow at vespers far to the north of camelot and half their journey will be done that is another lie by the space of a hundred and fifty miles their journey will not be merely half done it will be all done and they will be here in this valley that was a noble shot it set the abbot and the monks in a whirl of excitement and it rocked the enchanter to his base i followed the thing right up if the king does not arrive i will have myself ridden on a rail if he does i will ride you on a rail instead next day i went up to the telephone office and found that the king had passed through two towns that were on the line i spotted his progress on the succeeding day in the same way i kept these matters to myself the third days reports showed that if he kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon there was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming there seemed to be no preparations making to receive him in state a strange thing truly only one thing could explain this that other magician had been cutting under me sure this was true i asked a friend of mine a monk about it and he said yes the magician had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court had concluded to make no journey at all but stay at home think of that observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country these people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in history and the only one within their memory that had a positive value and yet here they were ready to take up with an adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word however it was not good politics to let the king come without any fuss and feathers at all so i went down and drummed up a procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and started them out at two o clock to meet him and that was the sort of state he arrived in the abbot was helpless with rage and humiliation when i brought him out on a balcony and showed him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to offer him welcome and no stir of life or clang of joy bell to glad his spirit he took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces the next minute the bells were dinning furiously and the various buildings were vomiting monks and nuns who went swarming in a rush toward the coming procession and with them went that magician and he was on a rail too by the abbots order and his reputation was in the mud and mine was in the sky again yes a man can keep his trademark current in such a country but he cant sit around and do it he has got to be on deck and attending to business right along chapter xxv a competitive examination when the king traveled for change of air or made a progress or visited a distant noble whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost of his keep part of the administration moved with him it was a fashion of the time the commission charged with the examination of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the valley whereas they could have transacted their business just as well at home and although this expedition was strictly a holiday excursion for the king he kept some of his business functions going just the same he touched for the evil as usual he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases for he was himself chief justice of the kings bench he shone very well in this latter office he was a wise and humane judge and he clearly did his honest best and fairest according to his lights that is a large reservation his lights i mean his rearing often colored his decisions whenever there was a dispute between a noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree the kings leanings and sympathies were for the former class always whether he suspected it or not it was impossible that this should be otherwise the blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholders moral perceptions are known and conceded the world over and a privileged class an aristocracy is but a band of slaveholders under another name this has a harsh sound and yet should not be offensive to any even to the noble himself unless the fact itself be an offense for the statement simply formulates a fact the repulsive feature of slavery is the thing not its name one needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below him to recognize and in but indifferently modified measure the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder and behind these are the slaveholders spirit the slaveholders blunted feeling they are the result of the same cause in both cases the possessors old and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being the kings judgments wrought frequent injustices but it was merely the fault of his training his natural and unalterable sympathies he was as unfitted for a judgeship as would be the average mother for the position of milk distributor to starving children in famine time her own children would fare a shade better than the rest one very curious case came before the king a young girl an orphan who had a considerable estate married a fine young fellow who had nothing the girls property was within a seigniory held by the church the bishop of the diocese an arrogant scion of the great nobility claimed the girls estate on the ground that she had married privately and thus had cheated the church out of one of its rights as lord of the seigniory the one heretofore referred to as le droit du seigneur the penalty of refusal or avoidance was confiscation the girls defense was that the lordship of the seigniory was vested in the bishop and the particular right here involved was not transferable but must be exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated and that an older law of the church itself strictly barred the bishop from exercising it it was a very odd case indeed it reminded me of something i had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of london raised the money that built the mansion house a person who had not taken the sacrament according to the anglican rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of london thus dissenters were ineligible they could not run if asked they could not serve if elected the aldermen who without any question were yankees in disguise hit upon this neat device they passed a by law imposing a fine of l upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff and a fine of l upon any person who after being elected sheriff refused to serve then they went to work and elected a lot of dissenters one after another and kept it up until they had collected l in fines and there stands the stately mansion house to this day to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of yankees slipped into london and played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth the girls case seemed strong to me the bishops case was just as strong i did not see how the king was going to get out of this hole but he got out i append his decision truly i find small difficulty here the matter being even a childs affair for simpleness an the young bride had conveyed notice as in duty bound to her feudal lord and proper master and protector the bishop she had suffered no loss for the said bishop could have got a dispensation making him for temporary conveniency eligible to the exercise of his said right and thus would she have kept all she had whereas failing in her first duty she hath by that failure failed in all for whoso clinging to a rope severeth it above his hands must fall it being no defense to claim that the rest of the rope is sound neither any deliverance from his peril as he shall find pardy the womans case is rotten at the source it is the decree of the court that she forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods even to the last farthing that she doth possess and be thereto mulcted in the costs next here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months old poor young creatures they had lived these three months lapped to the lips in worldly comforts these clothes and trinkets they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the shrewdest stretch of the sumptuary laws allowed to people of their degree and in these pretty clothes she crying on his shoulder and he trying to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless bedless breadless why the very beggars by the roadsides were not so poor as they well the king was out of the hole and on terms satisfactory to the church and the rest of the aristocracy no doubt men write many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy but the fact remains that where every man in a state has a vote brutal laws are impossible arthurs people were of course poor material for a republic because they had been debased so long by monarchy and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short work of that law which the king had just been administering if it had been submitted to their full and free vote there is a phrase which has grown so common in the worlds mouth that it has come to seem to have sense and meaning the sense and meaning implied when it is used that is the phrase which refers to this or that or the other nation as possibly being capable of self government and the implied sense of it is that there has been a nation somewhere some time or other which wasnt capable of it wasnt as able to govern itself as some self appointed specialists were or would be to govern it the master minds of all nations in all ages have sprung in affluent multitude from the mass of the nation and from the mass of the nation only not from its privileged classes and so no matter what the nations intellectual grade was whether high or low the bulk of its ability was in the long ranks of its nameless and its poor and so it never saw the day that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself which is to assert an always self proven fact that even the best governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still behind the best condition attainable by its people and that the same is true of kindred governments of lower grades all the way down to the lowest king arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond my calculations i had not supposed he would move in the matter while i was away and so i had not mapped out a scheme for determining the merits of officers i had only remarked that it would be wise to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination and privately i meant to put together a list of military qualifications that nobody could answer to but my west pointers that ought to have been attended to before i left for the king was so taken with the idea of a standing army that he couldnt wait but must get about it at once and get up as good a scheme of examination as he could invent out of his own head i was impatient to see what this was and to show too how much more admirable was the one which i should display to the examining board i intimated this gently to the king and it fired his curiosity when the board was assembled i followed him in and behind us came the candidates one of these candidates was a bright young west pointer of mine and with him were a couple of my west point professors when i saw the board i did not know whether to cry or to laugh the head of it was the officer known to later centuries as norroy king at arms the two other members were chiefs of bureaus in his department and all three were priests of course all officials who had to know how to read and write were priests my candidate was called first out of courtesy to me and the head of the board opened on him with official solemnity name mal ease son of webster webster websterh m i my memory faileth to recall the name condition weaver weaver god keep us the king was staggered from his summit to his foundations one clerk fainted and the others came near it the chairman pulled himself together and said indignantly it is sufficient get you hence but i appealed to the king i begged that my candidate might be examined the king was willing but the board who were all well born folk implored the king to spare them the indignity of examining the weavers son i knew they didnt know enough to examine him anyway so i joined my prayers to theirs and the king turned the duty over to my professors i had had a blackboard prepared and it was put up now and the circus began it was beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war and wallow in details of battle and siege of supply transportation mining and countermining grand tactics big strategy and little strategy signal service infantry cavalry artillery and all about siege guns field guns gatling guns rifled guns smooth bores musket practice revolver practice and not a solitary word of it all could these catfish make head or tail of you understand and it was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical nightmares on the blackboard that would stump the angels themselves and do it like nothing too all about eclipses and comets and solstices and constellations and mean time and sidereal time and dinner time and bedtime and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or under them that you could harry or bullyrag an enemy with and make him wish he hadnt come and when the boy made his military salute and stood aside at last i was proud enough to hug him and all those other people were so dazed they looked partly petrified partly drunk and wholly caught out and snowed under i judged that the cake was ours and by a large majority education is a great thing this was the same youth who had come to west point so ignorant that when i asked him if a general officer should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle what ought he to do answered up naively and said get up and brush himself one of the young nobles was called up now i thought i would question him a little myself i said can your lordship read his face flushed indignantly and he fired this at me takest me for a clerk i trow i am not of a blood that answer the question he crowded his wrath down and made out to answer no can you write he wanted to resent this too but i said you will confine yourself to the questions and make no comments you are not here to air your blood or your graces and nothing of the sort will be permitted can you write no do you know the multiplication table i wit not what ye refer to how much is times it is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the emergency requiring the fathoming of it hath not in my life days occurred and so not having no need to know this thing i abide barren of the knowledge if a trade a barrel of onions to b worth pence the bushel in exchange for a sheep worth pence and a dog worth a penny and c kill the dog before delivery because bitten by the same who mistook him for d what sum is still due to a from b and which party pays for the dogc or d and who gets the money if a is the penny sufficient or may he claim consequential damages in the form of additional money to represent the possible profit which might have inured from the dog and classifiable as earned increment that is to say usufruct verily in the all wise and unknowable providence of god who moveth in mysterious ways his wonders to perform have i never heard the fellow to this question for confusion of the mind and congestion of the ducts of thought wherefore i beseech you let the dog and the onions and these people of the strange and godless names work out their several salvations from their piteous and wonderful difficulties without help of mine for indeed their trouble is sufficient as it is whereas an i tried to help i should but damage their cause the more and yet mayhap not live myself to see the desolation wrought what do you know of the laws of attraction and gravitation if there be such mayhap his grace the king did promulgate them whilst that i lay sick about the beginning of the year and thereby failed to hear his proclamation what do you know of the science of optics i know of governors of places and seneschals of castles and sheriffs of counties and many like small offices and titles of honor but him you call the science of optics i have not heard of before peradventure it is a new dignity yes in this country try to conceive of this mollusk gravely applying for an official position of any kind under the sun why he had all the earmarks of a typewriter copyist if you leave out the disposition to contribute uninvited emendations of your grammar and punctuation it was unaccountable that he didnt attempt a little help of that sort out of his majestic supply of incapacity for the job but that didnt prove that he hadnt material in him for the disposition it only proved that he wasnt a typewriter copyist yet after nagging him a little more i let the professors loose on him and they turned him inside out on the line of scientific war and found him empty of course he knew somewhat about the warfare of the time bushwhacking around for ogres and bull fights in the tournament ring and such things but otherwise he was empty and useless then we took the other young noble in hand and he was the first ones twin for ignorance and incapacity i delivered them into the hands of the chairman of the board with the comfortable consciousness that their cake was dough they were examined in the previous order of precedence name so please you pertipole son of sir pertipole baron of barley mash grandfather also sir pertipole baron of barley mash great grandfather the same name and title great great grandfather we had none worshipful sir the line failing before it had reached so far back it mattereth not it is a good four generations and fulfilleth the requirements of the rule fulfills what rule i asked the rule requiring four generations of nobility or else the candidate is not eligible a man not eligible for a lieutenancy in the army unless he can prove four generations of noble descent even so neither lieutenant nor any other officer may be commissioned without that qualification oh come this is an astonishing thing what good is such a qualification as that what good it is a hardy question fair sir and boss since it doth go far to impugn the wisdom of even our holy mother church herself as how for that she hath established the self same rule regarding saints by her law none may be canonized until he hath lain dead four generations i see i see it is the same thing it is wonderful in the one case a man lies dead alive four generations mummified in ignorance and sloth and that qualifies him to command live people and take their weal and woe into his impotent hands and in the other case a man lies bedded with death and worms four generations and that qualifies him for office in the celestial camp does the kings grace approve of this strange law the king said why truly i see naught about it that is strange all places of honor and of profit do belong by natural right to them that be of noble blood and so these dignities in the army are their property and would be so without this or any rule the rule is but to mark a limit its purpose is to keep out too recent blood which would bring into contempt these offices and men of lofty lineage would turn their backs and scorn to take them i were to blame an i permitted this calamity you can permit it an you are minded so to do for you have the delegated authority but that the king should do it were a most strange madness and not comprehensible to any i yield proceed sir chief of the heralds college the chairman resumed as follows by what illustrious achievement for the honor of the throne and state did the founder of your great line lift himself to the sacred dignity of the british nobility he built a brewery sire the board finds this candidate perfect in all the requirements and qualifications for military command and doth hold his case open for decision after due examination of his competitor the competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations of nobility himself so there was a tie in military qualifications that far he stood aside a moment and sir pertipole was questioned further of what condition was the wife of the founder of your line she came of the highest landed gentry yet she was not noble she was gracious and pure and charitable of a blameless life and character insomuch that in these regards was she peer of the best lady in the land that will do stand down he called up the competing lordling again and asked what was the rank and condition of the great grandmother who conferred british nobility upon your great house she was a kings leman and did climb to that splendid eminence by her own unholpen merit from the sewer where she was born ah this indeed is true nobility this is the right and perfect intermixture the lieutenancy is yours fair lord hold it not in contempt it is the humble step which will lead to grandeurs more worthy of the splendor of an origin like to thine i was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation i had promised myself an easy and zenith scouring triumph and this was the outcome i was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the face i told him to go home and be patient this wasnt the end i had a private audience with the king and made a proposition i said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities and he couldnt have done a wiser thing it would also be a good idea to add five hundred officers to it in fact add as many officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the country even if there should finally be five times as many officers as privates in it and thus make it the crack regiment the envied regiment the kings own regiment and entitled to fight on its own hook and in its own way and go whither it would and come when it pleased in time of war and be utterly swell and independent this would make that regiment the hearts desire of all the nobility and they would all be satisfied and happy then we would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace materials and officer it with nobodies as was proper nobodies selected on a basis of mere efficiency and we would make this regiment toe the line allow it no aristocratic freedom from restraint and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering to the end that whenever the kings own was tired and wanted to go off for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a good time it could go without uneasiness knowing that matters were in safe hands behind it and business going to be continued at the old stand same as usual the king was charmed with the idea when i noticed that it gave me a valuable notion i thought i saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last you see the royalties of the pendragon stock were a long lived race and very fruitful whenever a child was born to any of these and it was pretty often there was wild joy in the nations mouth and piteous sorrow in the nations heart the joy was questionable but the grief was honest because the event meant another call for a royal grant long was the list of these royalties and they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury and a menace to the crown yet arthur could not believe this latter fact and he would not listen to any of my various projects for substituting something in the place of the royal grants if i could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for one of these outlying scions from his own pocket i could have made a grand to do over it and it would have had a good effect with the nation but no he wouldnt hear of such a thing he had something like a religious passion for royal grant he seemed to look upon it as a sort of sacred swag and one could not irritate him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that venerable institution if i ventured to cautiously hint that there was not another respectable family in england that would humble itself to hold out the hat however that is as far as i ever got he always cut me short there and peremptorily too but i believed i saw my chance at last i would form this crack regiment out of officers alone not a single private half of it should consist of nobles who should fill all the places up to major general and serve gratis and pay their own expenses and they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood these princes of the blood should range in rank from lieutenant general up to field marshal and be gorgeously salaried and equipped and fed by the state moreover and this was the master stroke it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always addressed by a stunningly gaudy and awe compelling title which i would presently invent and they and they only in all england should be so addressed finally all princes of the blood should have free choice join that regiment get that great title and renounce the royal grant or stay out and receive a grant neatest touch of all unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be born into the regiment and start fair with good wages and a permanent situation upon due notice from the parents all the boys would join i was sure of that so all existing grants would be relinquished that the newly born would always join was equally certain within sixty days that quaint and bizarre anomaly the royal grant would cease to be a living fact and take its place among the curiosities of the past chapter xxvi the first newspaper when i told the king i was going out disguised as a petty freeman to scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life of the people he was all afire with the novelty of the thing in a minute and was bound to take a chance in the adventure himself nothing should stop him he would drop everything and go along it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many a day he wanted to glide out the back way and start at once but i showed him that that wouldnt answer you see he was billed for the kings evil to touch for it i mean and it wouldnt be right to disappoint the house and it wouldnt make a delay worth considering anyway it was only a one night stand and i thought he ought to tell the queen he was going away he clouded up at that and looked sad i was sorry i had spoken especially when he said mournfully thou forgettest that launcelot is here and where launcelot is she noteth not the going forth of the king nor what day he returneth of course i changed the subject yes guenever was beautiful it is true but take her all around she was pretty slack i never meddled in these matters they werent my affair but i did hate to see the way things were going on and i dont mind saying that much manys the time she had asked me sir boss hast seen sir launcelot about but if ever she went fretting around for the king i didnt happen to be around at the time there was a very good lay out for the kings evil business very tidy and creditable the king sat under a canopy of state about him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals conspicuous both for location and personal outfit stood marinel a hermit of the quack doctor species to introduce the sick all abroad over the spacious floor and clear down to the doors in a thick jumble lay or sat the scrofulous under a strong light it was as good as a tableau in fact it had all the look of being gotten up for that though it wasnt there were eight hundred sick people present the work was slow it lacked the interest of novelty for me because i had seen the ceremonies before the thing soon became tedious but the proprieties required me to stick it out the doctor was there for the reason that in all such crowds there were many people who only imagined something was the matter with them and many who were consciously sound but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king and yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of coin that went with the touch up to this time this coin had been a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar when you consider how much that amount of money would buy in that age and country and how usual it was to be scrofulous when not dead you would understand that the annual kings evil appropriation was just the river and harbor bill of that government for the grip it took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the surplus so i had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself for the kings evil i covered six sevenths of the appropriation into the treasury a week before starting from camelot on my adventures and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into five cent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk of the kings evil department a nickel to take the place of each gold coin you see and do its work for it it might strain the nickel some but i judged it could stand it as a rule i do not approve of watering stock but i considered it square enough in this case for it was just a gift anyway of course you can water a gift as much as you want to and i generally do the old gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown origin as a rule but some of them were roman they were ill shapen and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full they were hammered not minted and they were so worn with use that the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters and looked like them i judged that a sharp bright new nickel with a first rate likeness of the king on one side of it and guenever on the other and a blooming pious motto would take the tuck out of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous fancy more and i was right this batch was the first it was tried on and it worked to a charm the saving in expense was a notable economy you will see that by these figures we touched a trifle over of the patients at former rates this would have cost the government about at the new rate we pulled through for about thus saving upward of at one swoop to appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke consider these other figures the annual expenses of a national government amount to the equivalent of a contribution of three days average wages of every individual of the population counting every individual as if he were a man if you take a nation of where average wages are per day three days wages taken from each individual will provide and pay the governments expenses in my day in my own country this money was collected from imposts and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it and it made him comfortable to think so whereas in fact it was paid by the american people and was so equally and exactly distributed among them that the annual cost to the millionaire and the annual cost to the sucking child of the day laborer was precisely the same each paid nothing could be equaler than that i reckon well scotland and ireland were tributary to arthur and the united populations of the british islands amounted to something less than a mechanics average wage was cents a day when he paid his own keep by this rule the national governments expenses were a year or about a day thus by the substitution of nickels for gold on a kings evil day i not only injured no one dissatisfied no one but pleased all concerned and saved four fifths of that days national expense into the bargain a saving which would have been the equivalent of in my day in america in making this substitution i had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source the wisdom of my boyhood for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom howsoever lowly may be its origin in my boyhood i had always saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary cause the buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as the coin the coin would answer me better than the buttons all hands were happy and nobody hurt marinel took the patients as they came he examined the candidate if he couldnt qualify he was warned off if he could he was passed along to the king a priest pronounced the words they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover then the king stroked the ulcers while the reading continued finally the patient graduated and got his nickel the king hanging it around his neck himself and was dismissed would you think that that would cure it certainly did any mummery will cure if the patients faith is strong in it up by astolat there was a chapel where the virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd geese around there the girl said so herself and they built the chapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the occurrence a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick person to approach whereas on the contrary thousands of the lame and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away whole and sound and even the well could look upon it and live of course when i was told these things i did not believe them but when i went there and saw them i had to succumb i saw the cures effected myself and they were real cures and not questionable i saw cripples whom i had seen around camelot for years on crutches arrive and pray before that picture and put down their crutches and walk off without a limp there were piles of crutches there which had been left by such people as a testimony in other places people operated on a patients mind without saying a word to him and cured him in others experts assembled patients in a room and prayed over them and appealed to their faith and those patients went away cured wherever you find a king who cant cure the kings evil you can be sure that the most valuable superstition that supports his throne the subjects belief in the divine appointment of his sovereign has passed away in my youth the monarchs of england had ceased to touch for the evil but there was no occasion for this diffidence they could have cured it forty nine times in fifty well when the priest had been droning for three hours and the good king polishing the evidences and the sick were still pressing forward as plenty as ever i got to feeling intolerably bored i was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state for the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his repulsivenesses stroked again those words were being droned out they shall lay their hands on the sick when outside there rang clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled thirteen worthless centuries about my ears camelot weekly hosannah and literary volcano latest irruption only two cents all about the big miracle in the valley of holiness one greater than kings had arrived the newsboy but i was the only person in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth and what this imperial magician was come into the world to do i dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper the adam newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change is around the corner yet it was delicious to see a newspaper again yet i was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon the first batch of display head lines i had lived in a clammy atmosphere of reverence respect deference so long that they sent a quivery little cold wave through me high times in the valley of holiness the water works corked brer merlin works his arts but gets left but the boss scores on his first innings the miraculous

seen nothing out of the way about it but now its note was discordant it was good arkansas journalism but this was not arkansas moreover the next to the last line was calculated to give offense to the hermits and perhaps lose us their advertising indeed there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through the paper it was plain i had undergone a considerable change without noticing it i found

smithies see his ad of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning i knew that quite well and yet it was somehow disappointing the court circular pleased me better indeed its simple and dignified respectfulness was a distinct refreshment to me after all those disgraceful familiarities but even it could have been improved do what one may there is no getting an air of variety into a court circular i acknowledge that there is a profound monotonousness about its facts that baffles and defeats ones sincerest efforts to make them sparkle and enthuse the best way to manage in fact the only sensible way is to disguise repetitiousness of fact under variety of form skin your fact each time and lay on a new cuticle of words it deceives the eye you think it is a new fact it gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything this excites you and you drain the whole column with a good appetite and perhaps never notice that its a barrel of soup made out of a single bean clarences way was good it was simple it was dignified it was direct and business like all i say is it was not the best way court circular on monday the king rode in the park tuesday wendesday thursday friday saturday sunday however take the paper by and large i was vastly pleased with it little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and there but there were not enough of them to amount to anything and it was good enough arkansas proof reading anyhow and better than was needed in arthurs day and realm as a rule the grammar was leaky and the construction more or less lame but i did not much mind these things they are common defects of my own and one mustnt criticise other people on grounds where he cant stand perpendicular himself i was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole paper at this one meal but i got only a few bites and then had to postpone because the monks around me besieged me so with eager questions what is this curious thing what is it for is it a handkerchief saddle blanket part of a shirt what is it made of how thin it is and how dainty and frail and how it rattles will it wear do you think and wont the rain injure it is it writing that appears on it or is it only ornamentation they suspected it was writing because those among them who knew how to read latin and had a smattering of greek recognized some of the letters but they could make nothing out of the result as a whole i put my information in the simplest form i could it is a public journal i will explain what that is another time it is not cloth it is made of paper some time i will explain what paper is the lines on it are reading matter and not written by hand but printed by and by i will explain what printing is a thousand of these sheets have been made all exactly like this in every minute detail they cant be told apart then they all broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration a thousand verily a mighty work a years work for many men no merely a days work for a man and a boy they crossed themselves and whiffed out a protective prayer or two ah h a miracle a wonder dark work of enchantment i let it go at that then i read in a low voice to as many as could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance part of the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well and was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through ah h h how true amazing amazing these be the very haps as they happened in marvelous exactness and might they take this strange thing in their hands and feel of it and examine it they would be very careful yes so they took it handling it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing come from some supernatural region and gently felt of its texture caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch and scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes these grouped bent heads these charmed faces these speaking eyes how beautiful to me for was not this my darling and was not all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent tribute and unforced compliment to it i knew then how a mother feels when women whether strangers or friends take her new baby and close themselves about it with one eager impulse and bend their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it were not for that time i knew how she feels and that there is no other satisfied ambition whether of king conqueror or poet that ever reaches half way to that serene far summit or yields half so divine a contentment during all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to group all up and down and about that huge hall and my happy eye was upon it always and i sat motionless steeped in satisfaction drunk with enjoyment yes this was heaven i was tasting it once if i might never taste it more chapter xxvii the yankee and the king travel incognito about bedtime i took the king to my private quarters to cut his hair and help him get the hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear the high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around whereas the lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both the slaves were bangless and allowed their hair free growth so i inverted a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it i also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only about a half inch long and tried to do it inartistically and succeeded it was a villainous disfigurement when he got his lubberly sandals on and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth which hung straight from his neck to his ankle bones he was no longer the comeliest man in his kingdom but one of the unhandsomest and most commonplace and unattractive we were dressed and barbered alike and could pass for small farmers or farm bailiffs or shepherds or carters yes or for village artisans if we chose our costume being in effect universal among the poor because of its strength and cheapness i dont mean that it was really cheap to a very poor person but i do mean that it was the cheapest material there was for male attire manufactured material you understand we slipped away an hour before dawn and by broad sun up had made eight or ten miles and were in the midst of a sparsely settled country i had a pretty heavy knapsack it was laden with provisions provisions for the king to taper down on till he could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage i found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside and then gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with then i said i would find some water for him and strolled away part of my project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little myself it had always been my custom to stand when in his presence even at the council board except upon those rare occasions when the sitting was a very long one extending over hours then i had a trifling little backless thing which was like a reversed culvert and was as comfortable as the toothache i didnt want to break him in suddenly but do it by degrees we should have to sit together now when in company or people would notice but it would not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when there was no necessity for it i found the water some three hundred yards away and had been resting about twenty minutes when i heard voices that is all right i thought peasants going to work nobody else likely to be stirring this early but the next moment these comers jingled into sight around a turn of the road smartly clad people of quality with luggage mules and servants in their train i was off like a shot through the bushes by the shortest cut for a while it did seem that these people would pass the king before i could get to him but desperation gives you wings you know and i canted my body forward inflated my breast and held my breath and flew i arrived and in plenty good enough time too pardon my king but its no time for ceremony jump jump to your feet some quality are coming is that a marvel let them come but my liege you must not be seen sitting rise and stand in humble posture while they pass you are a peasant you know true i had forgot it so lost was i in planning of a huge war with gaul he was up by this time but a farm could have got up quicker if there was any kind of a boom in real estate and right so a thought came randoming overthwart this majestic dream the which a humbler attitude my lord the king and quick duck your head more still more droop it he did his honest best but lord it was no great things he looked as humble as the leaning tower at pisa it is the most you could say of it indeed it was such a thundering poor success that it raised wondering scowls all along the line and a gorgeous flunkey at the tail end of it raised his whip but i jumped in time and was under it when it fell and under cover of the volley of coarse laughter which followed i spoke up sharply and warned the king to take no notice he mastered himself for the moment but it was a sore tax he wanted to eat up the procession i said it would end our adventures at the very start and we being without weapons could do nothing with that armed gang if we are going to succeed in our emprise we must not only look the peasant but act the peasant it is wisdom none can gainsay it let us go on sir boss i will take note and learn and do the best i may he kept his word he did the best he could but i ve seen better if you have ever seen an active heedless enterprising child going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day long and an anxious mother at its heels all the while and just saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with each new experiment you ve seen the king and me if i could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like i should have said no if anybody wants to make his living exhibiting a king as a peasant let him take the layout i can do better with a menagerie and last longer and yet during the first three days i never allowed him to enter a hut or other dwelling if he could pass muster anywhere during his early novitiate it would be in small inns and on the road so to these places we confined ourselves yes he certainly did the best he could but what of that he didnt improve a bit that i could see he was always frightening me always breaking out with fresh astonishers in new and unexpected places toward evening on the second day what does he do but blandly fetch out a dirk from inside his robe great guns my liege where did you get that from a smuggler at the inn yester eve what in the world possessed you to buy it we have escaped divers dangers by wit thy wit but i have bethought me that it were but prudence if i bore a weapon too thine might fail thee in some pinch but people of our condition are not allowed to carry arms what would a lord say yes or any other person of whatever condition if he caught an upstart peasant with a dagger on his person it was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then i persuaded him to throw the dirk away and it was as easy as persuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing itself we walked along silent and thinking finally the king said when ye know that i meditate a thing inconvenient or that hath a peril in it why do you not warn me to cease from that project it was a startling question and a puzzler i didnt quite know how to take hold of it or what to say and so of course i ended by saying the natural thing but sire how can i know what your thoughts are the king stopped dead in his tracks and stared at me i believed thou wert greater than merlin and truly in magic thou art but prophecy is greater than magic merlin is a prophet i saw i had made a blunder i must get back my lost ground after a deep reflection and careful planning i said sire i have been misunderstood i will explain there are two kinds of prophecy one is the gift to foretell things that are but a little way off the other is the gift to foretell things that are whole ages and centuries away which is the mightier gift do you think oh the last most surely true does merlin possess it partly yes he foretold mysteries about my birth and future kingship that were twenty years away has he ever gone beyond that he would not claim more i think it is probably his limit all prophets have their limit the limit of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years these are few i ween there have been two still greater ones whose limit was four hundred and six hundred years and one whose limit compassed even seven hundred and twenty gramercy it is marvelous but what are these in comparison with me they are nothing what canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch of time as seven hundred years my liege as clear as the vision of an eagle does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half my land you should have seen the kings eyes spread slowly open and lift the earths entire atmosphere as much as an inch that settled brer merlin one never had any occasion to prove his facts with these people all he had to do was to state them it never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement now then i continued i could work both kinds of prophecy the long and the short if i chose to take the trouble to keep in practice but i seldom exercise any but the long kind because the other is beneath my dignity it is properer to merlins sort stump tail prophets as we call them in the profession of course i whet up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy but not often hardly ever in fact you will remember that there was great talk when you reached the valley of holiness about my having prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival two or three days beforehand indeed yes i mind it now well i could have done it as much as forty times easier and piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain if it had been five hundred years away instead of two or three days how amazing that it should be so yes a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five hundred years away easier than he can a thing thats only five hundred seconds off and yet in reason it should clearly be the other way it should be five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first for indeed it is so close by that one uninspired might almost see it in truth the law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods most strangely making the difficult easy and the easy difficult it was a wise head a peasants cap was no safe disguise for it you could know it for a kings under a diving bell if you could hear it work its intellect i had a new trade now and plenty of business in it the king was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live in them from that time out i prophesied myself bald headed trying to supply the demand i have done some indiscreet things in my day but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the worst still it had its ameliorations a prophet doesnt have to have any brains they are good to have of course for the ordinary exigencies of life but they are no use in professional work it is the restfulest vocation there is when the spirit of prophecy comes upon you you merely take your intellect and lay it off in a cool place for a rest and unship your jaw and leave it alone it will work itself the result is prophecy every day a knight errant or so came along and the sight of them fired the kings martial spirit every time he would have forgotten himself sure and said something to them in a style a suspicious shade or so above his ostensible degree and so i always got him well out of the road in time then he would stand and look with all his eyes and a proud light would flash from them and his nostrils would inflate like a war horses and i knew he was longing for a brush with them but about noon of the third day i had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been suggested by the whip stroke that had fallen to my share two days before a precaution which i had afterward decided to leave untaken i was so loath to institute it but now i had just had a fresh reminder while striding heedlessly along with jaw spread and intellect at rest for i was prophesying i stubbed my toe and fell sprawling i was so pale i couldnt think for a moment then i got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack i had that dynamite bomb in it done up in wool in a box it was a good thing to have along the time would come when i could do a valuable miracle with it maybe but it was a nervous thing to have about me and i didnt like to ask the king to carry it yet i must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get along with its society i got it out and slipped it into my scrip and just then here came a couple of knights the king stood stately as a statue gazing toward them had forgotten himself again of course and before i could get a word of warning out it was time for him to skip and well that he did it too he supposed they would turn aside turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt under foot when had he ever turned aside himself or ever had the chance to do it if a peasant saw him or any other noble knight in time to judiciously save him the trouble the knights paid no attention to the king at all it was his place to look out himself and if he hadnt skipped he would have been placidly ridden down and laughed at besides the king was in a flaming fury and launched out his challenge and epithets with a most royal vigor the knights were some little distance by now they halted greatly surprised and turned in their saddles and looked back as if wondering if it might be worth while to bother with such scum as we then they wheeled and started for us not a moment must be lost i started for them i passed them at a rattling gait and as i went by i flung out a hair lifting soul scorching thirteen jointed insult which made the kings effort poor and cheap by comparison i got it out of the nineteenth century where they know how they had such headway that they were nearly to the king before they could check up then frantic with rage they stood up their horses on their hind hoofs and whirled them around and the next moment here they came breast to breast i was seventy yards off then and scrambling up a great bowlder at the roadside when they were within thirty yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level depressed their mailed heads and so with their horse hair plumes streaming straight out behind most gallant to see this lightning express came tearing for me when they were within fifteen yards i sent that bomb with a sure aim and it struck the ground just under the horses noses yes it was a neat thing very neat and pretty to see it resembled a steamboat explosion on the mississippi and during the next fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic fragments of knights and hardware and horse flesh i say we for the king joined the audience of course as soon as he had got his breath again there was a hole there which would afford steady work for all the people in that region for some years to come in trying to explain it i mean as for filling it up that service would be comparatively prompt and would fall to the lot of a select few peasants of that seignory and they wouldnt get anything for it either but i explained it to the king myself i said it was done with a dynamite bomb this information did him no damage because it left him as intelligent as he was before however it was a noble miracle in his eyes and was another settler for merlin i thought it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort that it couldnt be done except when the atmospheric conditions were just right otherwise he would be encoring it every time we had a good subject and that would be inconvenient because i hadnt any more bombs along chapter xxviii drilling the king on the morning of the fourth day when it was just sunrise and we had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn i came to a resolution the king must be drilled things could not go on so he must be taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled or we couldnt ever venture to enter a dwelling the very cats would know this masquerader for a humbug and no peasant so i called a halt and said sire as between clothes and countenance you are all right there is no discrepancy but as between your clothes and your bearing you are all wrong there is a most noticeable discrepancy your soldierly stride your lordly port these will not do you stand too straight your looks are too high too confident the cares of a kingdom do not stoop the shoulders they do not droop the chin they do not depress the high level of the eye glance they do not put doubt and fear in the heart and hang out the signs of them in slouching body and unsure step it is the sordid cares of the lowly born that do these things you must learn the trick you must imitate the trademarks of poverty misery oppression insult and the other several and common inhumanities that sap the manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and approved subject and a satisfaction to his masters or the very infants will know you for better than your disguise and we shall go to pieces at the first hut we stop at pray try to walk like this the king took careful note and then tried an imitation pretty fair pretty fair chin a little lower please there very good eyes too high pray dont look at the horizon look at the ground ten steps in front of you ah that is better that is very good wait please you betray too much vigor too much decision you want more of a shamble look at me please this is what i mean now you are getting it that is the idea at least it sort of approaches it yes that is pretty fair but there is a great big something wanting i dont quite know what it is please walk thirty yards so that i can get a perspective on the thing now then your heads right speeds right shoulders right eyes right chin right gait carriage general style right everythings right and yet the fact remains the aggregates wrong the account dont balance do it again please now i think i begin to see what it is yes i ve struck it you see the genuine spiritlessness is wanting thats whats the trouble its all amateur mechanical details all right almost to a hair everything about the delusion perfect except that it dont delude what then must one do to prevail let me think i cant seem to quite get at it in fact there isnt anything that can right the matter but practice this is a good place for it roots and stony ground to break up your stately gait a region not liable to interruption only one field and one hut in sight and they so far away that nobody could see us from there it will be well to move a little off the road and put in the whole day drilling you sire after the drill had gone on a little while i said now sire imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder and the family are before us proceed please accost the head of the house the king unconsciously straightened up like a monument and said with frozen austerity varlet bring a seat and serve to me what cheer ye have ah your grace that is not well done in what lacketh it these people do not call each other varlets nay is that true yes only those above them call them so then must i try again i will call him villein no no for he may be a freeman ah so then peradventure i should call him goodman that would answer your grace but it would be still better if you said friend or brother brother to dirt like that ah but we are pretending to be dirt like that too it is even true i will say it brother bring a seat and thereto what cheer ye have withal now tis right not quite not wholly right you have asked for one not us for one not both food for one a seat for one the king looked puzzled he wasnt a very heavy weight intellectually his head was an hour glass it could stow an idea but it had to do it a grain at a time not the whole idea at once would you have a seat also and sit if i did not sit the man would perceive that we were only pretending to be equals and playing the deception pretty poorly too it is well and truly said how wonderful is truth come it in whatsoever unexpected form it may yes he must bring out seats and food for both and in serving us present not ewer and napkin with more show of respect to the one than to the other and there is even yet a detail that needs correcting he must bring nothing outside we will go in in among the dirt and possibly other repulsive things and take the food with the household and after the fashion of the house and all on equal terms except the man be of the serf class and finally there will be no ewer and no napkin whether he be serf or free please walk again my liege there it is better it is the best yet but not perfect the shoulders have known no ignobler burden than iron mail and they will not stoop give me then the bag i will learn the spirit that goeth with burdens that have not honor it is the spirit that stoopeth the shoulders i ween and not the weight for armor is heavy yet it is a proud burden and a man standeth straight in it nay but me no buts offer me no objections i will have the thing strap it upon my back he was complete now with that knapsack on and looked as little like a king as any man i had ever seen but it was an obstinate pair of shoulders they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness the drill went on i prompting and correcting now make believe you are in debt and eaten up by relentless creditors you are out of work which is horse shoeing let us say and can get none and your wife is sick your children are crying because they are hungry and so on and so on i drilled him as representing in turn all sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes but lord it was only just words words they meant nothing in the world to him i might just as well have whistled words realize nothing vivify nothing to you unless you have suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to describe there are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about the working classes and satisfy themselves that a days hard intellectual work is very much harder than a days hard manual toil and is righteously entitled to much bigger pay why they really think that you know because they know all about the one but havent tried the other but i know all about both and so far as i am concerned there isnt money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days but i will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it down and i will be satisfied too intellectual work is misnamed it is a pleasure a dissipation and is its own highest reward the poorest paid architect engineer general author sculptor painter lecturer advocate legislator actor preacher singer is constructively in heaven when he is at work and as for the musician with the fiddle bow in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him why certainly he is at work if you wish to call it that but lord its a sarcasm just the same the law of work does seem utterly unfair but there it is and nothing can change it the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it the higher shall be his pay in cash also and its also the very law of those transparent swindles transmissible nobility and kingship chapter xxix the smallpox hut when we arrived at that hut at mid afternoon we saw no signs of life about it the field near by had been denuded of its crop some time before and had a skinned look so exhaustively had it been harvested and gleaned fences sheds everything had a ruined look and were eloquent of poverty no animal was around anywhere no living thing in sight the stillness was awful it was like the stillness of death the cabin was a one story one whose thatch was black with age and ragged from lack of repair the door stood a trifle ajar we approached it stealthily on tiptoe and at half breath for that is the way ones feeling makes him do at such a time the king knocked we waited no answer knocked again no answer i pushed the door softly open and looked in i made out some dim forms and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me as one does who is wakened from sleep presently she found her voice have mercy she pleaded all is taken nothing is left i have not come to take anything poor woman you are not a priest no nor come not from the lord of the manor no i am a stranger oh then for the fear of god who visits with misery and death such as be harmless tarry not here but fly this place is under his curse and his churchs let me come in and help you you are sick and in trouble i was better used to the dim light now i could see her hollow eyes fixed upon me i could see how emaciated she was i tell you the place is under the churchs ban save yourself and go before some straggler see thee here and report it give yourself no trouble about me i dont care anything for the churchs curse let me help you now all good spirits if there be any such bless thee for that word would god i had a sup of water but hold hold forget i said it and fly for there is that here that even he that feareth not the church must fear this disease whereof we die leave us thou brave good stranger and take with thee such whole and sincere blessing as them that be accursed can give but before this i had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing past the king on my way to the brook it was ten yards away when i got back and entered the king was within and was opening the shutter that closed the window hole to let in air and light the place was full of a foul stench i put the bowl to the womans lips and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came open and a strong light flooded her face smallpox i sprang to the king and said in his ear out of the door on the instant sire the woman is dying of that disease that wasted the skirts of camelot two years ago he did not budge of a truth i shall remain and likewise help i whispered again king it must not be you must go ye mean well and ye speak not unwisely but it were shame that a king should know fear and shame that belted knight should withhold his hand where be such as need succor peace i will not go it is you who must go the churchs ban is not upon me but it forbiddeth you to be here and she will deal with you with a heavy hand an word come to her of your trespass it was a desperate place for him to be in and might cost him his life but it was no use to argue with him if he considered his knightly honor at stake here that was the end of argument he would stay and nothing could prevent it i was aware of that and so i dropped the subject the woman spoke fair sir of your kindness will ye climb the ladder there and bring me news of what ye find be not afraid to report for times can come when even a mothers heart is past breaking being already broke abide said the king and give the woman to eat i will go and he put down the knapsack i turned to start but the king had already started he halted and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light and had not noticed us thus far or spoken is it your husband the king asked yes is he asleep god be thanked for that one charity yes these three hours where shall i pay to the full my gratitude for my heart is bursting with it for that sleep he sleepeth now i said we will be careful we will not wake him ah no that ye will not for he is dead dead yes what triumph it is to know it none can harm him none insult him more he is in heaven now and happy or if not there he bides in hell and is content for in that place he will find neither abbot nor yet bishop we were boy and girl together we were man and wife these five and twenty years and never separated till this day think how long that is to love and suffer together this morning was he out of his mind and in his fancy we were boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields and so in that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther still lightly gossiping and entered into those other fields we know not of and was shut away from mortal sight and so there was no parting for in his fancy i went with him he knew not but i went with him my hand in his my young soft hand not this withered claw ah yes to go and know it not to separate and know it not how could one go peace fuller than that it was his reward for a cruel life patiently borne there was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where the ladder was it was the king descending i could see that he was bearing something in one arm and assisting himself with the other he came forward into the light upon his breast lay a slender girl of fifteen she was but half conscious she was dying of smallpox here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility its utmost summit this was challenging death in the open field unarmed with all the odds against the challenger no reward set upon the contest and no admiring world in silks and cloth of gold to gaze and applaud and yet the kings bearing was as serenely brave as it had always been in those cheaper contests where knight meets knight in equal fight and clothed in protecting steel he was great now sublimely great the rude statues of his ancestors in his palace should have an addition i would see to that and it would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a dragon like the rest it would be a king in commoners garb bearing death in his arms that a peasant mother might look her last upon her child and be comforted he laid the girl down by her mother who poured out endearments and caresses from an overflowing heart and one could detect a flickering faint light of response in the childs eyes but that was all the mother hung over her kissing her petting her and imploring her to speak but the lips only moved and no sound came i snatched my liquor flask from my knapsack but the woman forbade me and said no she does not suffer it is better so it might bring her back to life none that be so good and kind as ye are would do her that cruel hurt for look you what is left to live for her brothers are gone her father is gone her mother goeth the churchs curse is upon her and none may shelter or befriend her even though she lay perishing in the road she is desolate i have not asked you good heart if her sister be still on live here overhead i had no need ye had gone back else and not left the poor thing forsaken she lieth at peace interrupted the king in a subdued voice i would not change it how rich is this day in happiness ah my annis thou shalt join thy sister soon thou rt on thy way and these be merciful friends that will not hinder and so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again and softly stroking her face and hair and kissing her and calling her by endearing names but there was scarcely sign of response now in the glazing eyes i saw tears well from the kings eyes and trickle down his face the woman noticed them too and said ah i know that sign thou st a wife at home poor soul and you and she have gone hungry to bed manys the time that the little ones might have your crust you know what poverty is and the daily insults of your betters and the heavy hand of the church and the king the king winced under this accidental home shot but kept still he was learning his part and he was playing it well too for a pretty dull beginner i struck up a diversion i offered the woman food and liquor but she refused both she would allow nothing to come between her and the release of death then i slipped away and brought the dead child from aloft and laid it by her this broke her down again and there was another scene that was full of heartbreak by and by i made another diversion and beguiled her to sketch her story ye know it well yourselves having suffered it for truly none of our condition in britain escape it it is the old weary tale we fought and struggled and succeeded meaning by success that we lived and did not die more than that is not to be claimed no troubles came that we could not outlive till this year brought them then came they all at once as one might say and overwhelmed us years ago the lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on our farm in the best part of it too a grievous wrong and shame but it was his right interrupted the king none denieth that indeed an the law mean anything what is the lords is his and what is mine is his also our farm was ours by lease therefore twas likewise his to do with it as he would some little time ago three of those trees were found hewn down our three grown sons ran frightened to report the crime well in his lordships dungeon there they lie who saith there shall they lie and rot till they confess they have naught to confess being innocent wherefore there will they remain until they die ye know that right well i ween think how this left us a man a woman and two children to gather a crop that was planted by so much greater force yes and protect it night and day from pigeons and prowling animals that be sacred and must not be hurt by any of our sort when my lords crop was nearly ready for the harvest so also was ours when his bell rang to call us to his fields to harvest his crop for nothing he would not allow that i and my two girls should count for our three captive sons but for only two of them so for the lacking one were we daily fined all this time our own crop was perishing through neglect and so both the priest and his lordship fined us because their shares of it were suffering through damage in the end the fines ate up our crop and they took it all they took it all and made us harvest it for them without pay or food and we starving then the worst came when i being out of my mind with hunger and loss of my boys and grief to see my husband and my little maids in rags and misery and despair uttered a deep blasphemy oh a thousand of them against the church and the churchs ways it was ten days ago i had fallen sick with this disease and it was to the priest i said the words for he was come to chide me for lack of due humility under the chastening hand of god he carried my trespass to his betters i was stubborn wherefore presently upon my head and upon all heads that were dear to me fell the curse of rome since that day we are avoided shunned with horror none has come near this hut to know whether we live or not the rest of us were taken down then i roused me and got up as wife and mother will it was little they could have eaten in any case it was less than little they had to eat but there was water and i gave them that how they craved it and how they blessed it but the end came yesterday my strength broke down yesterday was the last time i ever saw my husband and this youngest child alive i have lain here all these hours these ages ye may say listening listening for any sound up there that she gave a sharp quick glance at her eldest daughter then cried out oh my darling and feebly gathered the stiffening form to her sheltering arms she had recognized the death rattle chapter xxx the tragedy of the manor house at midnight all was over and we sat in the presence of four corpses we covered them with such rags as we could find and started away fastening the door behind us their home must be these peoples grave for they could not have christian burial or be admitted to consecrated ground they were as dogs wild beasts lepers and no soul that valued its hope of eternal life would throw it away by meddling in any sort with these rebuked and smitten outcasts we had not moved four steps when i caught a sound as of footsteps upon gravel my heart flew to my throat we must not be seen coming from that house i plucked at the kings robe and we drew back and took shelter behind the corner of the cabin now we are safe i said but it was a close call so to speak if the night had been lighter he might have seen us no doubt he seemed to be so near mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all true but man or beast it will be wise to stay here a minute and let it get by and out of the way hark it cometh hither true again the step was coming toward us straight toward the hut it must be a beast then and we might as well have saved our trepidation i was going to step out but the king laid his hand upon my arm there was a moment of silence then we heard a soft knock on the cabin door it made me shiver presently the knock was repeated and then we heard these words in a guarded voice mother father open we have got free and we bring news to pale your cheeks but glad your hearts and we may not tarry but must fly and but they answer not mother father i drew the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered come now we can get to the road the king hesitated was going to demur but just then we heard the door give way and knew that those desolate men were in the presence of their dead come my liege in a moment they will strike a light and then will follow that which it would break your heart to hear he did not hesitate this time the moment we were in the road i ran and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed i did not want to think of what was happening in the hut i couldnt bear it i wanted to drive it out of my mind so i struck into the first subject that lay under that one in my mind i have had the disease those people died of and so have nothing to fear but if you have not had it also he broke in upon me to say he was in trouble and it was his conscience that was troubling him these young men have got free they say but how it is not likely that their lord hath set them free oh no i make no doubt they escaped that is my trouble i have a fear that this is so and your suspicion doth confirm it you having the same fear i should not call it by that name though i do suspect that they escaped but if they did i am not sorry certainly i am not sorry i think but what is it what is there for one to be troubled about if they did escape then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon them and deliver them again to their lord for it is not seemly that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high handed outrage from persons of their base degree there it was again he could see only one side of it he was born so educated so his veins were full of ancestral blood that was rotten with this sort of unconscious brutality brought down by inheritance from a long procession of hearts that had each done its share toward poisoning the stream to imprison these men without proof and starve their kindred was no harm for they were merely peasants and subject to the will and pleasure of their lord no matter what fearful form it might take but for these men to break out of unjust captivity was insult and outrage and a thing not to be countenanced by any conscientious person who knew his duty to his sacred caste i worked more than half an hour before i got him to change the subject and even then an outside matter did it for me this was a something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a small hill a red glow a good way off thats a fire said i fires interested me considerably because i was getting a good deal of an insurance business started and was also training some horses and building some steam fire engines with an eye to a paid fire department by and by the priests opposed both my fire and life insurance on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to hinder the decrees of god and if you pointed out that they did not hinder the decrees in the least but only modified the hard consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck they retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of god and was just as bad so they managed to damage those industries more or less but i got even on my accident business as a rule a knight is a lummux and some times even a labrick and hence open to pretty poor arguments when they come glibly from a superstition monger but even he could see the practical side of a thing once in a while and so of late you couldnt clean up a tournament and pile the result without finding one of my accident tickets in every helmet we stood there awhile in the thick darkness and stillness looking toward the red blur in the distance and trying to make out the meaning of a far away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the night sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed less remote but when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its cause and nature it dulled and sank again carrying its mystery with it we started down the hill in its direction and the winding road plunged us at once into almost solid darkness darkness that was packed and crammed in between two tall forest walls we groped along down for half a mile perhaps that murmur growing more and more distinct all the time the coming storm threatening more and more with now and then a little shiver of wind a faint show of lightning and dull grumblings of distant thunder i was in the lead i ran against something a soft heavy something which gave slightly to the impulse of my weight at the same moment the lightning glared out and within a foot of my face was the writhing face of a man who was hanging from the limb of a tree that is it seemed to be writhing but it was not it was a grewsome sight straightway there was an ear splitting explosion of thunder and the bottom of heaven fell out the rain poured down in a deluge no matter we must try to cut this man down on the chance that there might be life in him yet mustnt we the lightning came quick and sharp now and the place was alternately noonday and midnight one moment the man would be hanging before me in an intense light and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness i told the king we must cut him down the king at once objected if he hanged himself he was willing to lose him property to his lord so let him be if others hanged him belike they had the right let him hang but but me no buts but even leave him as he is and for yet another reason when the lightning cometh again there look abroad two others hanging within fifty yards of us it is not weather meet for doing useless courtesies unto dead folk they are past thanking you come it is unprofitable to tarry here there was reason in what he said so we moved on within the next mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the lightning and altogether it was a grisly excursion that murmur was a murmur no longer it was a roar a roar of mens voices a man came flying by now dimly through the darkness and other men chasing him they disappeared presently another case of the kind occurred and then another and another then a sudden turn of the road brought us in sight of that fire it was a large manor house and little or nothing was left of it and everywhere men were flying and other men raging after them in pursuit i warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers we would better get away from the light until matters should improve we stepped back a little and hid in the edge of the wood from this hiding place we saw both men and women hunted by the mob the fearful work went on until nearly dawn then the fire being out and the storm spent the voices and flying footsteps presently ceased and darkness and stillness reigned again we ventured out and hurried cautiously away and although we were worn out and sleepy we kept on until we had put this place some miles behind us then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal burner and got what was to be had a woman was up and about but the man was still asleep on a straw shake down on the clay floor the woman seemed uneasy until i explained that we were travelers and had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night she became talkative then and asked if we had heard of the terrible goings on at the manor house of abblasoure yes we had heard of them but what we wanted now was rest and sleep the king broke in sell us the house and take yourselves away for we be perilous company being late come from people that died of the spotted death it was good of him but unnecessary one of the commonest decorations of the nation was the waffle iron face i had early noticed that the woman and her husband were both so decorated she made us entirely welcome and had no fears and plainly she was immensely impressed by the kings proposition for of course it was a good deal of an event in her life to run across a person of the kings humble appearance who was ready to buy a mans house for the sake of a nights lodging it gave her a large respect for us and she strained the lean possibilities of her hovel to the utmost to make us comfortable we slept till far into the afternoon and then got up hungry enough to make cotter fare quite palatable to the king the more particularly as it was scant in quantity and also in variety it consisted solely of onions salt and the national black bread made out of horse feed the woman told us about the affair of the evening before at ten or eleven at night when everybody was in bed the manor house burst into flames the country side swarmed to the rescue and the family were saved with one exception the master he did not appear everybody was frantic over this loss and two brave yeomen sacrificed their lives in ransacking the burning house seeking that valuable personage but after a while he was found what was left of him which was his corpse it was in a copse three hundred yards away bound gagged stabbed in a dozen places who had done this suspicion fell upon a humble family in the neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness by the baron and from these people the suspicion easily extended itself to their relatives and familiars a suspicion was enough my lords liveried retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against these people and were promptly joined by the community in general the womans husband had been active with the mob and had not returned home until nearly dawn he was gone now to find out what the general result had been while we were still talking he came back from his quest his report was revolting enough eighteen persons hanged or butchered and two yeomen and thirteen prisoners lost in the fire and how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults thirteen then every one of them was lost yes all but the people arrived in time to save the family how is it they could save none of the prisoners the man looked puzzled and said would one unlock the vaults at such a time marry some would have escaped then you mean that nobody did unlock them none went near them either to lock or unlock it standeth to reason that the bolts were fast wherefore it was only needful to establish a watch so that if any broke the bonds he might not escape but be taken none were taken natheless three did escape said the king and ye will do well to publish it and set justice upon their track for these murthered the baron and fired the house i was just expecting he would come out with that for a moment the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and an impatience to go out and spread it then a sudden something else betrayed itself in their faces and they began to ask questions i answered the questions myself and narrowly watched the effects produced i was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these three prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere that our hosts continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now only pretended and not real the king did not notice the change and i was glad of that i worked the conversation around toward other details of the nights proceedings and noted that these people were relieved to have it take that direction the painful thing observable about all this business was the alacrity with which this oppressed community had turned their cruel hands against their own class in the interest of the common oppressor this man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel between a person of their own class and his lord it was the natural and proper and rightful thing for that poor devils whole caste to side with the master and fight his battle for him without ever stopping to inquire into the rights or wrongs of the matter this man had been out helping to hang his neighbors and had done his work with zeal and yet was aware that there was nothing against them but a mere suspicion with nothing back of it describable as evidence still neither he nor his wife seemed to see anything horrible about it this was depressing to a man with the dream of a republic in his head it reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away when the poor whites of our south who were always despised and frequently insulted by the slave lords around them and who owed their base condition simply to the presence of slavery in their midst were yet pusillanimously ready to side with the slave lords in all political moves for the upholding and perpetuating of slavery and did also finally shoulder their muskets and pour out their lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that very institution which degraded them and there was only one redeeming feature connected with that pitiful piece of history and that was that secretly the poor white did detest the slave lord and did feel his own shame that feeling was not brought to the surface but the fact that it was there and could have been brought out under favoring circumstances was something in fact it was enough for it showed that a man is at bottom a man after all even if it doesnt show on the outside well as it turned out this charcoal burner was just the twin of the southern poor white of the far future the king presently showed impatience and said an ye prattle here all the day justice will miscarry think ye the criminals will abide in their fathers house they are fleeing they are not waiting you should look to it that a party of horse be set upon their track the woman paled slightly but quite perceptibly and the man looked flustered and irresolute i said come friend i will walk a little way with you and explain which direction i think they would try to take if they were merely resisters of the gabelle or some kindred absurdity i would try to protect them from capture but when men murder a person of high degree and likewise burn his house that is another matter the last remark was for the king to quiet him on the road the man pulled his resolution together and began the march with a steady gait but there was no eagerness in it by and by i said what relation were these men to you cousins he turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him and stopped trembling ah my god how know ye that i didnt know it it was a chance guess poor lads they are lost and good lads they were too were you actually going yonder to tell on them he didnt quite know how to take that but he said hesitatingly ye s then i think you are a damned scoundrel it made him as glad as if i had called him an angel say the good words again brother for surely ye mean that ye would not betray me an i failed of my duty duty there is no duty in the matter except the duty to keep still and let those men get away they ve done a righteous deed he looked pleased pleased and touched with apprehension at the same time he looked up and down the road to see that no one was coming and then said in a cautious voice from what land come you brother that you speak such perilous words and seem not to be afraid they are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste i take it you would not tell anybody i said them i i would be drawn asunder by wild horses first well then let me say my say i have no fears of your repeating it i think devils work has been done last night upon those innocent poor people that old baron got only what he deserved if i had my way all his kind should have the same luck fear and depression vanished from the mans manner and gratefulness and a brave animation took their place even though you be a spy and your words a trap for my undoing yet are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others like to them i would go to the gallows happy as having had one good feast at least in a starved life and i will say my say now and ye may report it if ye be so minded i helped to hang my neighbors for that it were peril to my own life to show lack of zeal in the masters cause the others helped for none other reason all rejoice to day that he is dead but all do go about seemingly sorrowing and shedding the hypocrites tear for in that lies safety i have said the words i have said the words the only ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth and the reward of that taste is sufficient lead on an ye will be it even to the scaffold for i am ready there it was you see a man is a man at bottom whole ages of abuse and oppression cannot crush the manhood clear out of him whoever thinks it a mistake is himself mistaken yes there is plenty good enough material for a republic in the most degraded people that ever existed even the russians plenty of manhood in them even in the germans if one could but force it out of its timid and suspicious privacy to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it we should see certain things yet let us hope and believe first a modified monarchy till arthurs days were done then the destruction of the throne nobility abolished every member of it bound out to some useful trade universal suffrage instituted and the whole government placed in the hands of the men and women of the nation there to remain yes there was no occasion to give up my dream yet a while chapter xxxi marco we strolled along in a sufficiently indolent fashion now and talked we must dispose of about the amount of time it ought to take to go to the little hamlet of abblasoure and put justice on the track of those murderers and get back home again and meantime i had an auxiliary interest which had never paled yet never lost its novelty for me since i had been in arthurs kingdom the behavior born of nice and exact subdivisions of caste of chance passers by toward each other toward the shaven monk who trudged along with his cowl tilted back and the sweat washing down his fat jowls the coal burner was deeply reverent to the gentleman he was abject with the small farmer and the free mechanic he was cordial and gossipy and when a slave passed by with a countenance respectfully lowered this chaps nose was in the air he couldnt even see him well there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce presently we struck an incident a small mob of half naked boys and girls came tearing out of the woods scared and shrieking the eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen years old they implored help but they were so beside themselves that we couldnt make out what the matter was however we plunged into the wood they skurrying in the lead and the trouble was quickly revealed they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope and he was kicking and struggling in the process of choking to death we rescued him and fetched him around it was some more human nature the admiring little folk imitating their elders they were playing mob and had achieved a success which promised to be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for it was not a dull excursion for me i managed to put in the time very well i made various acquaintanceships and in my quality of stranger was able to ask as many questions as i wanted to a thing which naturally interested me as a statesman was the matter of wages i picked up what i could under that head during the afternoon a man who hasnt had much experience and doesnt think is apt to measure a nations prosperity or lack of prosperity by the mere size of the prevailing wages if the wages be high the nation is prosperous if low it isnt which is an error it isnt what sum you get its how much you can buy with it thats the important thing and its that that tells whether your wages are high in fact or only high in name i could remember how it was in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century in the north a carpenter got three dollars a day gold valuation in the south he got fifty payable in confederate shinplasters worth a dollar a bushel in the north a suit of overalls cost three dollars a days wages in the south it cost seventy five which was two days wages other things were in proportion consequently wages were twice as high in the north as they were in the south because the one wage had that much more purchasing power than the other had yes i made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing that gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation lots of milrays lots of mills lots of cents a good many nickels and some silver all this among the artisans and commonalty generally yes and even some gold but that was at the bank that is to say the goldsmiths i dropped in there while marco the son of marco was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarter of a pound of salt and asked for change for a twenty dollar gold piece they furnished it that is after they had chewed the piece and rung it on the counter and tried acid on it and asked me where i got it and who i was and where i was from and where i was going to and when i expected to get there and perhaps a couple of hundred more questions and when they got aground i went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily told them i owned a dog and his name was watch and my first wife was a free will baptist and her grandfather was a prohibitionist and i used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart on the inside of his upper lip and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection and so on and so on and so on till even that hungry village questioner began to look satisfied and also a shade put out but he had to respect a man of my financial strength and so he didnt give me any lip but i noticed he took it out of his underlings which was a perfectly natural thing to do yes they changed my twenty but i judged it strained the bank a little which was a thing to be expected for it was the same as walking into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring the boss of it to change a two thousand dollar bill for you all of a sudden he could do it maybe but at the same time he would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much money around in his pocket which was probably this goldsmiths thought too for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing after me with reverent admiration our new money was not only handsomely circulating but its language was already glibly in use that is to say people had dropped the names of the former moneys and spoke of things as being worth so many dollars or cents or mills or milrays now it was very gratifying we were progressing that was sure i got to know several master mechanics but about the most interesting fellow among them was the blacksmith dowley he was a live man and a brisk talker and had two journeymen and three apprentices and was doing a raging business in fact he was getting rich hand over fist and was vastly respected marco was very proud of having such a man for a friend he had taken me there ostensibly to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his charcoal but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar terms he was on with this great man dowley and i fraternized at once i had had just such picked men splendid fellows under me in the colt arms factory i was bound to see more of him so i invited him to come out to marcos sunday and dine with us marco was appalled and held his breath and when the grandee accepted he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished at the condescension marcos joy was exuberant but only for a moment then he grew thoughtful then sad and when he heard me tell dowley i should have dickon the boss mason and smug the boss wheelwright out there too the coal dust on his face turned to chalk and he lost his grip but i knew what was the matter with him it was the expense he saw ruin before him he judged that his financial days were numbered however on our way to invite the others i said you must allow me to have these friends come and you must also allow me to pay the costs his face cleared and he said with spirit but not all of it not all of it ye cannot well bear a burden like to this alone i stopped him and said now lets understand each other on the spot old friend i am only a farm bailiff it is true but i am not poor nevertheless i have been very fortunate this year you would be astonished to know how i have thriven i tell you the honest truth when i say i could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never care that for the expense and i snapped my fingers i could see myself rise a foot at a time in marcos estimation and when i fetched out those last words i was become a very tower for style and altitude so you see you must let me have my way you cant contribute a cent to this orgy thats settled its grand and good of you no it isnt you ve opened your house to jones and me in the most generous way jones was remarking upon it to day just before you came back from the village for although he wouldnt be likely to say such a thing to you because jones isnt a talker and is diffident in society he has a good heart and a grateful and knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated yes you and your wife have been very hospitable toward us ah brother tis nothing such hospitality but it is something the best a man has freely given is always something and is as good as a prince can do and ranks right along beside it for even a prince can but do his best and so we ll shop around and get up this layout now and dont you worry about the expense im one of the worst spendthrifts that ever was born why do you know sometimes in a single week i spend but never mind about that youd never believe it anyway and so we went gadding along dropping in here and there pricing things and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot and now and then running across pathetic reminders of it in the persons of shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged the raiment of marco and his wife was of coarse tow linen and linsey woolsey respectively and resembled township maps it being made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added township by township in the course of five or six years until hardly a hands breadth of the original garments was surviving and present now i wanted to fit these people out with new suits on account of that swell company and i didnt know just how to get at it with delicacy until at last it struck me that as i had already been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king it would be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial sort so i said and marco theres another thing which you must permit out of kindness for jones because you wouldnt want to offend him he was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way but he is so diffident he couldnt venture it himself and so he begged me to buy some little things and give them to you and dame phyllis and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from him you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing and so i said i would and we would keep mum well his idea was a new outfit of clothes for you both oh it is wastefulness it may not be brother it may not be consider the vastness of the sum hang the vastness of the sum try to keep quiet for a moment and see how it would seem a body cant get in a word edgeways you talk so much you ought to cure that marco it isnt good form you know and it will grow on you if you dont check it yes we ll step in here now and price this mans stuff and dont forget to remember to not let on to jones that you know he had anything to do with it you cant think how curiously sensitive and proud he is hes a farmer pretty fairly well to do farmer and im his bailiff but the imagination of that man why sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off youd think he was one of the swells of the earth and you might listen to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer especially if he talked agriculture he thinks hes a sheol of a farmer thinks hes old grayback from wayback but between you and me privately he dont know as much about farming as he does about running a kingdom still whatever he talks about you want to drop your underjaw and listen the same as if you had never heard such incredible wisdom in all your life before and were afraid you might die before you got enough of it that will please jones it tickled marco to the marrow to hear about such an odd character but it also prepared him for accidents and in my experience when you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and cant remember it more than about half the time you cant take too many precautions this was the best store we had come across yet it had everything in it in small quantities from anvils and drygoods all the way down to fish and pinchbeck jewelry i concluded i would bunch my whole invoice right here and not go pricing around any more so i got rid of marco by sending him off to invite the mason and the wheelwright which left the field free to me for i never care to do a thing in a quiet way its got to be theatrical or i dont take any interest in it i showed up money enough in a careless way to corral the shopkeepers respect and then i wrote down a list of the things i wanted and handed it to him to see if he could read it he could and was proud to show that he could he said he had been educated by a priest and could both read and write he ran it through and remarked with satisfaction that it was a pretty heavy bill well and so it was for a little concern like that i was not only providing a swell dinner but some odds and ends of extras i ordered that the things be carted out and delivered at the dwelling of marco the son of marco by saturday evening and send me the bill at dinner time sunday he said i could depend upon his promptness and exactitude it was the rule of the house he also observed that he would throw in a couple of miller guns for the marcos gratis that everybody was using them now he had a mighty opinion of that clever device i said and please fill them up to the middle mark too and add that to the bill he would with pleasure he filled them and i took them with me i couldnt venture to tell him that the miller gun was a little invention of my own and that i had officially ordered that every shopkeeper in the kingdom keep them on hand and sell them at government price which was the merest trifle and the shopkeeper got that not the government we furnished them for nothing the king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall he had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of gaul with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back and the afternoon had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again chapter xxxii dowleys humiliation well when that cargo arrived toward sunset saturday afternoon i had my hands full to keep the marcos from fainting they were sure jones and i were ruined past help and they blamed themselves as accessories to this bankruptcy you see in addition to the dinner materials which called for a sufficiently round sum i had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family for instance a big lot of wheat a delicacy as rare to the tables of their class as was ice cream to a hermits also a sizeable deal dinner table also two entire pounds of salt which was another piece of extravagance in those peoples eyes also crockery stools the clothes a small cask of beer and so on i instructed the marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness so as to give me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little concerning the new clothes the simple couple were like children they were up and down all night to see if it wasnt nearly daylight so that they could put them on and they were into them at last as much as an hour before dawn was due then their pleasure not to say delirium was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered the king had slept just as usual like the dead the marcos could not thank him for their clothes that being forbidden but they tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful they were which all went for nothing he didnt notice any change it turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is just a june day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be out of doors toward noon the guests arrived and we assembled under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances even the kings reserve melted a little though it was some little trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of jones along at first i had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer but i had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing stand at that and not elaborate it any because he was just the kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like that if you didnt warn him his tongue was so handy and his spirit so willing and his information so uncertain dowley was in fine feather and i early got him started and then adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and himself for a hero and then it was good to sit there and hear him hum self made man you know they know how to talk they do deserve more credit than any other breed of men yes that is true and they are among the very first to find it out too he told how he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends able to help him how he had lived as the slaves of the meanest master lived how his days work was from sixteen to eighteen hours long and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a half fed condition how his faithful endeavors finally attracted the attention of a good blacksmith who came near knocking him dead with kindness by suddenly offering when he was totally unprepared to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years and give him board and clothes and teach him the trade or mystery as dowley called it that was his first great rise his first gorgeous stroke of fortune and you saw that he couldnt yet speak of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human being he got no new clothing during his apprenticeship but on his graduation day his master tricked him out in spang new tow linens and made him feel unspeakably rich and fine i remember me of that day the wheelwright sang out with enthusiasm and i likewise cried the mason i would not believe they were thine own in faith i could not nor other shouted dowley with sparkling eyes i was like to lose my character the neighbors wending i had mayhap been stealing it was a great day a great day one forgetteth not days like that yes and his master was a fine man and prosperous and always had a great feast of meat twice in the year and with it white bread true wheaten bread in fact lived like a lord so to speak and in time dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter and now consider what is come to pass said he impressively two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table he made a pause here to let that fact sink home then added and eight times salt meat it is even true said the wheelwright with bated breath i know it of mine own knowledge said the mason in the same reverent fashion on my table appeareth white bread every sunday in the year added the master smith with solemnity i leave it to your own consciences friends if this is not also true by my head yes cried the mason i can testify it and i do said the wheelwright and as to furniture ye shall say yourselves what mine equipment is he waved his hand in fine gesture of granting frank and unhampered freedom of speech and added speak as ye are moved speak as ye would speak an i were not here ye have five stools and of the sweetest workmanship at that albeit your family is but three said the wheelwright with deep respect and six wooden goblets and six platters of wood and two of pewter to eat and drink from withal said the mason impressively and i say it as knowing god is my judge and we tarry not here alway but must answer at the last day for the things said in the body be they false or be they sooth now ye know what manner of man i am brother jones said the smith with a fine and friendly condescension and doubtless ye would look to find me a man jealous of his due of respect and but sparing of outgo to strangers till their rating and quality be assured but trouble yourself not as concerning that wit ye well ye shall find me a man that regardeth not these matters but is willing to receive any he as his fellow and equal that carrieth a right heart in his body be his worldly estate howsoever modest and in token of it here is my hand and i say with my own mouth we are equals equals and he smiled around on the company with the satisfaction of a god who is doing the handsome and gracious thing and is quite well aware of it the king took the hand with a poorly disguised reluctance and let go of it as willingly as a lady lets go of a fish all of which had a good effect for it was mistaken for an embarrassment natural to one who was being called upon by greatness the dame brought out the table now and set it under the tree it caused a visible stir of surprise it being brand new and a sumptuous article of deal but the surprise rose higher still when the dame with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity slowly unfolded an actual simon pure tablecloth and spread it that was a notch above even the blacksmiths domestic grandeurs and it hit him hard you could see it but marco was in paradise you could see that too then the dame brought two fine new stools whew that was a sensation it was visible in the eyes of every guest then she brought two more as calmly as she could sensation again with awed murmurs again she brought two walking on air she was so proud the guests were petrified and the mason muttered there is that about earthly pomps which doth ever move to reverence as the dame turned away marco couldnt help slapping on the climax while the thing was hot so he said with what was meant for a languid composure but was a poor imitation of it these suffice leave the rest so there were more yet it was a fine effect i couldnt have played the hand better myself from this out the madam piled up the surprises with a rush that fired the general astonishment up to a hundred and fifty in the shade and at the same time paralyzed expression of it down to gasped ohs and ahs and mute upliftings of hands and eyes she fetched crockery new and plenty of it new wooden goblets and other table furniture and beer fish chicken a goose eggs roast beef roast mutton a ham a small roast pig and a wealth of genuine white wheaten bread take it by and large that spread laid everything far and away in the shade that ever that crowd had seen before and while they sat there just simply stupefied with wonder and awe i sort of waved my hand as if by accident and the storekeepers son emerged from space and said he had come to collect thats all right i said indifferently what is the amount give us the items then he read off this bill while those three amazed men listened and serene waves of satisfaction rolled over my soul and alternate waves of terror and admiration surged over marcos pounds salt dozen pints beer in the wood bushels wheat pounds fish hens goose dozen eggs roast of beef roast of mutton ham sucking pig crockery dinner sets mens suits and underwear stuff and linsey woolsey gown and underwear wooden goblets various table furniture deal table stools miller guns loaded he ceased there was a pale and awful silence not a limb stirred not a nostril betrayed the passage of breath is that all i asked in a voice of the most perfect calmness all fair sir save that certain matters of light moment are placed together under a head hight sundries if it would like you i will sepa it is of no consequence i said accompanying the words with a gesture of the most utter indifference give me the grand total please the clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself and said thirty nine thousand one hundred and fifty milrays the wheelwright fell off his stool the others grabbed the table to save themselves and there was a deep and general ejaculation of god be with us in the day of disaster the clerk hastened to say my father chargeth me to say he cannot honorably require you to pay it all at this time and therefore only prayeth you i paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze but with an air of indifference amounting almost to weariness got out my money and tossed four dollars on to the table ah you should have seen them stare the clerk was astonished and charmed he asked me to retain one of the dollars as security until he could go to town and i interrupted what and fetch back nine cents nonsense take the whole keep the change there was an amazed murmur to this effect verily this being is made of money he throweth it away even as if it were dirt the blacksmith was a crushed man the clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune i said to marco and his wife good folk here is a little trifle for you handing the miller guns as if it were a matter of no consequence though each of them contained fifteen cents in solid cash and while the poor creatures went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude i turned to the others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day well if we are all ready i judge the dinner is come fall to ah well it was immense yes it was a daisy i dont know that i ever put a situation together better or got happier spectacular effects out of the materials available the blacksmith well he was simply mashed land i wouldnt have felt what that man was feeling for anything in the world here he had been blowing and bragging about his grand meat feast twice a year and his fresh meat twice a month and his salt meat twice a week and his white bread every sunday the year round all for a family of three the entire cost for the year not above sixty nine cents two mills and six milrays and all of a sudden here comes along a man who slashes out nearly four dollars on a single blow out and not only that but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small sums yes dowley was a good deal wilted and shrunk up and collapsed he had the aspect of a bladder balloon thats been stepped on by a cow chapter xxxiii sixth century political economy however i made a dead set at him and before the first third of the dinner was reached i had him happy again it was easy to do in a country of ranks and castes you see in a country where they have ranks and castes a man isnt ever a man he is only part of a man he cant ever get his full growth you prove your superiority over him in station or rank or fortune and thats the end of it he knuckles down you cant insult him after that no i dont mean quite that of course you can insult him i only mean its difficult and so unless you ve got a lot of useless time on your hands it doesnt pay to try i had the smiths reverence now because i was apparently immensely prosperous and rich i could have had his adoration if i had had some little gimcrack title of nobility and not only his but any commoners in the land though he were the mightiest production of all the ages in intellect worth and character and i bankrupt in all three this was to remain so as long as england should exist in the earth with the spirit of prophecy upon me i could look into the future and see her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable georges and other royal and noble clothes horses and leave unhonored the creators of this world after god gutenburg watt arkwright whitney morse stephenson bell the king got his cargo aboard and then the talk not turning upon battle conquest or iron clad duel he dulled down to drowsiness and went off to take a nap mrs marco cleared the table placed the beer keg handy and went away to eat her dinner of leavings in humble privacy and the rest of us soon drifted into matters near and dear to the hearts of our sort business and wages of course at a first glance things appeared to be exceeding prosperous in this little tributary kingdom whose lord was king bagdemagus as compared with the state of things in my own region they had the protection system in full force here whereas we were working along down toward free trade by easy stages and were now about half way before long dowley and i were doing all the talking the others hungrily listening dowley warmed to his work snuffed an advantage in the air and began to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me and they did have something of that look in your country brother what is the wage of a master bailiff master hind carter shepherd swineherd twenty five milrays a day that is to say a quarter of a cent the smiths face beamed with joy he said with us they are allowed the double of it and what may a mechanic get carpenter dauber mason painter blacksmith wheelwright and the like on the average fifty milrays half a cent a day ho ho with us they are allowed a hundred with us any good mechanic is allowed a cent a day i count out the tailor but not the others they are all allowed a cent a day and in driving times they get more yes up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen milrays a day i ve paid a hundred and fifteen myself within the week rah for protection to sheol with free trade and his face shone upon the company like a sunburst but i didnt scare at all i rigged up my pile driver and allowed myself fifteen minutes to drive him into the earth drive him all in drive him in till not even the curve of his skull should show above ground here is the way i started in on him i asked what do you pay a pound for salt a hundred milrays we pay forty what do you pay for beef and mutton when you buy it that was a neat hit it made the color come it varieth somewhat but not much one may say seventy five milrays the pound we pay thirty three what do you pay for eggs fifty milrays the dozen we pay twenty what do you pay for beer it costeth us eight and one half milrays the pint we get it for four twenty five bottles for a cent what do you pay for wheat at the rate of nine hundred milrays the bushel we pay four hundred what do you pay for a mans tow linen suit thirteen cents we pay six what do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the laborer or the mechanic we pay eight cents four mills well observe the difference you pay eight cents and four mills we pay only four cents i prepared now to sock it to him i said look here dear friend whats become of your high wages you were bragging so about a few minutes ago and i looked around on the company with placid satisfaction for i had slipped up on him gradually and tied him hand and foot you see without his ever noticing that he was being tied at all whats become of those noble high wages of yours i seem to have knocked the stuffing all out of them it appears to me but if you will believe me he merely looked surprised that is all he didnt grasp the situation at all didnt know he had walked into a trap didnt discover that he was in a trap i could have shot him from sheer vexation with cloudy eye and a struggling intellect he fetched this out marry i seem not to understand it is proved that our wages be double thine how then may it be that thou st knocked therefrom the stuffing an miscall not the wonderly word this being the first time under grace and providence of god it hath been granted me to hear it well i was stunned partly with this unlooked for stupidity on his part and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with him and were of his mind if you might call it mind my position was simple enough plain enough how could it ever be simplified more however i must try why look here brother dowley dont you see your wages are merely higher than ours in name not in fact hear him they are the double ye have confessed it yourself yes yes i dont deny that at all but thats got nothing to do with it the amount of the wages in mere coins with meaningless names attached to them to know them by has got nothing to do with it the thing is how much can you buy with your wages thats the idea while it is true that with you a good mechanic is allowed about three dollars and a half a year and with us only about a dollar and seventy five there ye re confessing it again ye re confessing it again confound it i ve never denied it i tell you what i say is this with us half a dollar buys more than a dollar buys with you and therefore it stands to reason and the commonest kind of common sense that our wages are higher than yours he looked dazed and said despairingly verily i cannot make it out ye ve just said ours are the higher and with the same breath ye take it back oh great scott isnt it possible to get such a simple thing through your head now look here let me illustrate we pay four cents for a womans stuff gown you pay which is four mills more than double what do you allow a laboring woman who works on a farm two mills a day very good we allow but half as much we pay her only a tenth of a cent a day and again ye re conf wait now you see the thing is very simple this time you ll understand it for instance it takes your woman days to earn her gown at mills a day weeks work but ours earns hers in forty days two days short of weeks your woman has a gown and her whole seven weeks wages are gone ours has a gown and two days wages left to buy something else with there now you understand it he looked well he merely looked dubious its the most i can say so did the others i waited to let the thing work dowley spoke at last and betrayed the fact that he actually hadnt gotten away from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet he said with a trifle of hesitancy but but ye cannot fail to grant that two mills a day is better than one shucks well of course i hated to give it up so i chanced another flyer let us suppose a case suppose one of your journeymen goes out and buys the following articles pound of salt dozen eggs dozen pints of beer bushel of wheat tow linen suit pounds of beef pounds of mutton the lot will cost him cents it takes him working days to earn the money weeks and days let him come to us and work days at half the wages he can buy all those things for a shade under cents they will cost him a shade under days work and he will have about half a weeks wages over carry it through the year he would save nearly a weeks wages every two months your man nothing thus saving five or six weeks wages in a year your man not a cent now i reckon you understand that high wages and low wages are phrases that dont mean anything in the world until you find out which of them will buy the most it was a crusher but alas it didnt crush no i had to give it up what those people valued was high wages it didnt seem to be a matter of any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything or not they stood for protection and swore by it which was reasonable enough because interested parties had gulled them into the notion that it was protection which had created their high wages i proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages had advanced but per cent while the cost of living had gone up and that with us in a shorter time wages had advanced per cent while the cost of living had gone steadily down but it didnt do any good nothing could unseat their strange beliefs well i was smarting under a sense of defeat undeserved defeat but what of that that didnt soften the smart any and to think of the circumstances the first statesman of the age the capablest man the best informed man in the entire world the loftiest uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any political firmament for centuries sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant country blacksmith and i could see that those others were sorry for me which made me blush till i could smell my whiskers scorching put yourself in my place feel as mean as i did as ashamed as i felt wouldnt you have struck below the belt to get even yes you would it is simply human nature well that is what i did i am not trying to justify it im only saying that i was mad and anybody would have done it well when i make up my mind to hit a man i dont plan out a love tap no that isnt my way as long as im going to hit him at all im going to hit him a lifter and i dont jump at him all of a sudden and risk making a blundering half way business of it no i get away off yonder to one side and work up on him gradually so that he never suspects that im going to hit him at all and by and by all in a flash hes flat on his back and he cant tell for the life of him how it all happened that is the way i went for brother dowley i started to talking lazy and comfortable as if i was just talking to pass the time and the oldest man in the world couldnt have taken the bearings of my starting place and guessed where i was going to fetch up boys theres a good many curious things about law and custom and usage and all that sort of thing when you come to look at it yes and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement too there are written laws they perish but there are also unwritten laws they are eternal take the unwritten law of wages it says they ve got to advance little by little straight through the centuries and notice how it works we know what wages are now here and there and yonder we strike an average and say thats the wages of to day we know what the wages were a hundred years ago and what they were two hundred years ago thats as far back as we can get but it suffices to give us the law of progress the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation and so without a document to help us we can come pretty close to determining what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago good so far do we stop there no we stop looking backward we face around and apply the law to the future my friends i can tell you what peoples wages are going to be at any date in the future you want to know for hundreds and hundreds of years what goodman what yes in seven hundred years wages will have risen to six times what they are now here in your region and farm hands will be allowed cents a day and mechanics i wouldt i might die now and live then interrupted smug the wheelwright with a fine avaricious glow in his eye and that isnt all they ll get their board besides such as it is it wont bloat them two hundred and fifty years later pay attention now a mechanics wages will be mind you this is law not guesswork a mechanics wages will then be twenty cents a day there was a general gasp of awed astonishment dickon the mason murmured with raised eyes and hands more than three weeks pay for one days work riches of a truth yes riches muttered marco his breath coming quick and short with excitement wages will keep on rising little by little little by little as steadily as a tree grows and at the end of three hundred and forty years more there ll be at least one country where the mechanics average wage will be two hundred cents a day it knocked them absolutely dumb not a man of them could get his breath for upwards of two minutes then the coal burner said prayerfully might i but live to see it it is the income of an earl said smug an earl say ye said dowley ye could say more than that and speak no lie theres no earl in the realm of bagdemagus that hath an income like to that income of an earl mf its the income of an angel now then that is what is going to happen as regards wages in that remote day that man will earn with one weeks work that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of fifty weeks to earn now some other pretty surprising things are going to happen too brother dowley who is it that determines every spring what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic laborer and servant shall be for that year sometimes the courts sometimes the town council but most of all the magistrate ye may say in general terms it is the magistrate that fixes the wages doesnt ask any of those poor devils to help him fix their wages for them does he hm that were an idea the master thats to pay him the money is the one thats rightly concerned in that matter ye will notice yes but i thought the other man might have some little trifle at stake in it too and even his wife and children poor creatures the masters are these nobles rich men the prosperous generally these few who do no work determine what pay the vast hive shall have who do work you see they re a combine a trade union to coin a new phrase who band themselves together to force their lowly brother to take what they choose to give thirteen hundred years hence so says the unwritten law the combine will be the other way and then how these fine peoples posterity will fume and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade unions yes indeed the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century and then all of a sudden the wage earner will consider that a couple of thousand years or so is enough of this one sided sort of thing and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself ah he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation to settle do ye believe that he actually will help to fix his own wages yes indeed and he will be strong and able then brave times brave times of a truth sneered the prosperous smith oh and theres another detail in that day a master may hire a man for only just one day or one week or one month at a time if he wants to what its true moreover a magistrate wont be able to force a man to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man wants to or not will there be no law or sense in that day both of them dowley in that day a man will be his own property not the property of magistrate and master and he can leave town whenever he wants to if the wages dont suit him and they cant put him in the pillory for it perdition catch such an age shouted dowley in strong indignation an age of dogs an age barren of reverence for superiors and respect for authority the pillory oh wait brother say no good word for that institution i think the pillory ought to be abolished a most strange idea why well i ll tell you why is a man ever put in the pillory for a capital crime no is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small offense and then kill him there was no answer i had scored my first point for the first time the smith wasnt up and ready the company noticed it good effect you dont answer brother you were about to glorify the pillory a while ago and shed some pity on a future age that isnt going to use it i think the pillory ought to be abolished what usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the pillory for some little offense that didnt amount to anything in the world the mob try to have some fun with him dont they yes they begin by clodding him and they laugh themselves to pieces to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another yes then they throw dead cats at him dont they yes well then suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against him and suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community for his pride or his prosperity or one thing or another stones and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently dont they there is no doubt of it as a rule he is crippled for life isnt he jaws broken teeth smashed out or legs mutilated gangrened presently cut off or an eye knocked out maybe both eyes it is true god knoweth it and if he is unpopular he can depend on dying right there in the stocks cant he he surely can one may not deny it i take it none of you are unpopular by reason of pride or insolence or conspicuous prosperity or any of those things that excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village you wouldnt think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks dowley winced visibly i judged he was hit but he didnt betray it by any spoken word as for the others they spoke out plainly and with strong feeling they said they had seen enough of the stocks to know what a mans chance in them was and they would never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick death by hanging well to change the subject for i think i ve established my point that the stocks ought to be abolished i think some of our laws are pretty unfair for instance if i do a thing which ought to deliver me to the stocks and you know i did it and yet keep still and dont report me you will get the stocks if anybody informs on you ah but that would serve you but right said dowley for you must inform so saith the law the others coincided well all right let it go since you vote me down but theres one thing which certainly isnt fair the magistrate fixes a mechanics wage at one cent a day for instance the law says that if any master shall venture even under utmost press of business to pay anything over that cent a day even for a single day he shall be both fined and pilloried for it and whoever knows he did it and doesnt inform they also shall be fined and pilloried now it seems to me unfair dowley and a deadly peril to all of us that because you thoughtlessly confessed a while ago that within a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil oh i tell you it was a smasher you ought to have seen them to go to pieces the whole gang i had just slipped up on poor smiling and complacent dowley so nice and easy and softly that he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow came crashing down and knocked him all to rags a fine effect in fact as fine as any i ever produced with so little time to work it up in but i saw in a moment that i had overdone the thing a little i was expecting to scare them but i wasnt expecting to scare them to death they were mighty near it though you see they had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the pillory and to have that thing staring them in the face and every one of them distinctly at the mercy of me a stranger if i chose to go and report well it was awful and they couldnt seem to recover from the shock they couldnt seem to pull themselves together pale shaky dumb pitiful why they werent any better than so many dead men it was very uncomfortable of course i thought they would appeal to me to keep mum and then we would shake hands and take a drink all round and laugh it off and there an end but no you see i was an unknown person among a cruelly oppressed and suspicious people a people always accustomed to having advantage taken of their helplessness and never expecting just or kind treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates appeal to me to be gentle to be fair to be generous of course they wanted to but they couldnt dare chapter xxxiv the yankee and the king sold as slaves well what had i better do nothing in a hurry sure i must get up a diversion anything to employ me while i could think and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life again there sat marco petrified in the act of trying to get the hang of his miller gun turned to stone just in the attitude he was in when my pile driver fell the toy still gripped in his unconscious fingers so i took it from him and proposed to explain its mystery mystery a simple little thing like that and yet it was mysterious enough for that race and that age i never saw such an awkward people with machinery you see they were totally unused to it the miller gun was a little double barreled tube of toughened glass with a neat little trick of a spring to it which upon pressure would let a shot escape but the shot wouldnt hurt anybody it would only drop into your hand in the gun were two sizes wee mustard seed shot and another sort that were several times larger they were money the mustard seed shot represented milrays the larger ones mills so the gun was a purse and very handy too you could pay out money in the dark with it with accuracy and you could carry it in your mouth or in your vest pocket if you had one i made them of several sizes one size so large that it would carry the equivalent of a dollar using shot for money was a good thing for the government the metal cost nothing and the money couldnt be counterfeited for i was the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower paying the shot soon came to be a common phrase yes and i knew it would still be passing mens lips away down in the nineteenth century yet none would suspect how and when it originated the king joined us about this time mightily refreshed by his nap and feeling good anything could make me nervous now i was so uneasy for our lives were in danger and so it worried me to detect a complacent something in the kings eye which seemed to indicate that he had been loading himself up for a performance of some kind or other confound it why must he go and choose such a time as this i was right he began straight off in the most innocently artful and transparent and lubberly way to lead up to the subject of agriculture the cold sweat broke out all over me i wanted to whisper in his ear man we are in awful danger every moment is worth a principality till we get back these mens confidence dont waste any of this golden time but of course i couldnt do it whisper to him it would look as if we were conspiring so i had to sit there and look calm and pleasant while the king stood over that dynamite mine and mooned along about his damned onions and things at first the tumult of my own thoughts summoned by the danger signal and swarming to the rescue from every quarter of my skull kept up such a hurrah and confusion and fifing and drumming that i couldnt take in a word but presently when my mob of gathering plans began to crystallize and fall into position and form line of battle a sort of order and quiet ensued and i caught the boom of the kings batteries as if out of remote distance were not the best way methinks albeit it is not to be denied that authorities differ as concerning this point some contending that the onion is but an unwholesome berry when stricken early from the tree the audience showed signs of life and sought each others eyes in a surprised and troubled way whileas others do yet maintain with much show of reason that this is not of necessity the case instancing that plums and other like cereals do be always dug in the unripe state the audience exhibited distinct distress yes and also fear yet are they clearly wholesome the more especially when one doth assuage the asperities of their nature by admixture of the tranquilizing juice of the wayward cabbage the wild light of terror began to glow in these mens eyes and one of them muttered these be errors every one god hath surely smitten the mind of this farmer i was in miserable apprehension i sat upon thorns and further instancing the known truth that in the case of animals the young which may be called the green fruit of the creature is the better all confessing that when a goat is ripe his fur doth heat and sore engame his flesh the which defect taken in connection with his several rancid habits and fulsome appetites and godless attitudes of mind and bilious quality of morals they rose and went for him with a fierce shout the one would betray us the other is mad kill them kill them they flung themselves upon us what joy flamed up in the kings eye he might be lame in agriculture but this kind of thing was just in his line he had been fasting long he was hungry for a fight he hit the blacksmith a crack under the jaw that lifted him clear off his feet and stretched him flat on his back st george for britain and he downed the wheelwright the mason was big but i laid him out like nothing the three gathered themselves up and came again went down again came again and kept on repeating this with native british pluck until they were battered to jelly reeling with exhaustion and so blind that they couldnt tell us from each other and yet they kept right on hammering away with what might was left in them hammering each other for we stepped aside and looked on while they rolled and struggled and gouged and pounded and bit with the strict and wordless attention to business of so many bulldogs we looked on without apprehension for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe from intrusion well while they were gradually playing out it suddenly occurred to me to wonder what had become of marco i looked around he was nowhere to be seen oh but this was ominous i pulled the kings sleeve and we glided away and rushed for the hut no marco there no phyllis there they had gone to the road for help sure i told the king to give his heels wings and i would explain later we made good time across the open ground and as we darted into the shelter of the wood i glanced back and saw a mob of excited peasants swarm into view with marco and his wife at their head they were making a world of noise but that couldnt hurt anybody the wood was dense and as soon as we were well into its depths we would take to a tree and let them whistle ah but then came another sound dogs yes that was quite another matter it magnified our contract we must find running water we tore along at a good gait and soon left the sounds far behind and modified to a murmur we struck a stream and darted into it we waded swiftly down it in the dim forest light for as much as three hundred yards and then came across an oak with a great bough sticking out over the water we climbed up on this bough and began to work our way along it to the body of the tree now we began to hear those sounds more plainly so the mob had struck our trail for a while the sounds approached pretty fast and then for another while they didnt no doubt the dogs had found the place where we had entered the stream and were now waltzing up and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again when we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage the king was satisfied but i was doubtful i believed we could crawl along a branch and get into the next tree and i judged it worth while to try we tried it and made a success of it though the king slipped at the junction and came near failing to connect we got comfortable lodgment and satisfactory concealment among the foliage and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt presently we heard it coming and coming on the jump too yes and down both sides of the stream louder louder next minute it swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings barkings tramplings and swept by like a cyclone i was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest something to them said i but i dont mind the disappointment come my liege it were well that we make good use of our time we ve flanked them dark is coming on presently if we can cross the stream and get a good start and borrow a couple of horses from somebodys pasture to use for a few hours we shall be safe enough we started down and got nearly to the lowest limb when we seemed to hear the hunt returning we stopped to listen yes said i they re baffled they ve given it up they re on their way home we will climb back to our roost again and let them go by so we climbed back the king listened a moment and said they still search i wit the sign we did best to abide he was right he knew more about hunting than i did the noise approached steadily but not with a rush the king said they reason that we were advantaged by no parlous start of them and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took the water yes sire that is about it i am afraid though i was hoping better things the noise drew nearer and nearer and soon the van was drifting under us on both sides of the water a voice called a halt from the other bank and said an they were so minded they could get to yon tree by this branch that overhangs and yet not touch ground ye will do well to send a man up it marry that we will do i was obliged to admire my cuteness in foreseeing this very thing and swapping trees to beat it but dont you know there are some things that can beat smartness and foresight awkwardness and stupidity can the best swordsman in the world doesnt need to fear the second best swordsman in the world no the person for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never had a sword in his hand before he doesnt do the thing he ought to do and so the expert isnt prepared for him he does the thing he ought not to do and often it catches the expert out and ends him on the spot well how could i with all my gifts make any valuable preparation against a near sighted cross eyed pudding headed clown who would aim himself at the wrong tree and hit the right one and that is what he did he went for the wrong tree which was of course the right one by mistake and up he started matters were serious now we remained still and awaited developments the peasant toiled his difficult way up the king raised himself up and stood he made a leg ready and when the comers head arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud and down went the man floundering to the ground there was a wild outbreak of anger below and the mob swarmed in from all around and there we were treed and prisoners another man started up the bridging bough was detected and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished the bridge the king ordered me to play horatius and keep the bridge for a while the enemy came thick and fast but no matter the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged him as soon as he came in reach the kings spirits rose his joy was limitless he said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect we should have a beautiful night for on this line of tactics we could hold the tree against the whole country side however the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves wherefore they called off the assault and began to debate other plans they had no weapons but there were plenty of stones and stones might answer we had no objections a stone might possibly penetrate to us once in a while but it wasnt very likely we were well protected by boughs and foliage and were not visible from any good aiming point if they would but waste half an hour in stone throwing the dark would come to our help we were feeling very well satisfied we could smile almost laugh but we didnt which was just as well for we should have been interrupted before the stones had been raging through the leaves and bouncing from the boughs fifteen minutes we began to notice a smell a couple of sniffs of it was enough of an explanation it was smoke our game was up at last we recognized that when smoke invites you you have to come they raised their pile of dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher and when they saw the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree they broke out in a storm of joy clamors i got enough breath to say proceed my liege after you is manners the king gasped follow me down and then back thyself against one side of the trunk and leave me the other then will we fight let each pile his dead according to his own fashion and taste then he descended barking and coughing and i followed i struck the ground an instant after him we sprang to our appointed places and began to give and take with all our might the powwow and racket were prodigious it was a tempest of riot and confusion and thick falling blows suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst of the crowd and a voice shouted hold or ye are dead men how good it sounded the owner of the voice bore all the marks of a gentleman picturesque and costly raiment the aspect of command a hard countenance with complexion and features marred by dissipation the mob fell humbly back like so many spaniels the gentleman inspected us critically then said sharply to the peasants what are ye doing to these people they be madmen worshipful sir that have come wandering we know not whence and ye know not whence do ye pretend ye know them not most honored sir we speak but the truth they are strangers and unknown to any in this region and they be the most violent and bloodthirsty madmen that ever peace ye know not what ye say they are not mad who are ye and whence are ye explain we are but peaceful strangers sir i said and traveling upon our own concerns we are from a far country and unacquainted here we have purposed no harm and yet but for your brave interference and protection these people would have killed us as you have divined sir we are not mad neither are we violent or bloodthirsty the gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly lash me these animals to their kennels the mob vanished in an instant and after them plunged the horsemen laying about them with their whips and pitilessly riding down such as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the bush the shrieks and supplications presently died away in the distance and soon the horsemen began to straggle back meantime the gentleman had been questioning us more closely but had dug no particulars out of us we were lavish of recognition of the service he was doing us but we revealed nothing more than that we were friendless strangers from a far country when the escort were all returned the gentleman said to one of his servants bring the led horses and mount these people yes my lord we were placed toward the rear among the servants we traveled pretty fast and finally drew rein some time after dark at a roadside inn some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our troubles my lord went immediately to his room after ordering his supper and we saw no more of him at dawn in the morning we breakfasted and made ready to start my lords chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with indolent grace and said ye have said ye should continue upon this road which is our direction likewise wherefore my lord the earl grip hath given commandment that ye retain the horses and ride and that certain of us ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that hight cambenet whenso ye shall be out of peril we could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the offer we jogged along six in the party at a moderate and comfortable gait and in conversation learned that my lord grip was a very great personage in his own region which lay a days journey beyond cambenet we loitered to such a degree that it was near the middle of the forenoon when we entered the market square of the town we dismounted and left our thanks once more for my lord and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of the square to see what might be the object of interest it was the remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves so they had been dragging their chains about all this weary time that poor husband was gone and also many others and some few purchases had been added to the gang the king was not interested and wanted to move along but i was absorbed and full of pity i could not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity there they sat grounded upon the ground silent uncomplaining with bowed heads a pathetic sight and by hideous contrast a redundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty steps away in fulsome laudation of our glorious british liberties i was boiling i had forgotten i was a plebeian i was remembering i was a man cost what it might i would mount that rostrum and click the king and i were handcuffed together our companions those servants had done it my lord grip stood looking on the king burst out in a fury and said what meaneth this ill mannered jest my lord merely said to his head miscreant coolly put up the slaves and sell them slaves the word had a new sound and how unspeakably awful the king lifted his manacles and brought them down with a deadly force but my lord was out of the way when they arrived a dozen of the rascals servants sprang forward and in a moment we were helpless with our hands bound behind us we so loudly and so earnestly proclaimed ourselves freemen that we got the interested attention of that liberty mouthing orator and his patriotic crowd and they gathered about us and assumed a very determined attitude the orator said if indeed ye are freemen ye have nought to fear the god given liberties of britain are about ye for your shield and shelter applause ye shall soon see bring forth your proofs what proofs proof that ye are freemen ah i remembered i came to myself i said nothing but the king stormed out thou rt insane man it were better and more in reason that this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are not freemen you see he knew his own laws just as other people so often know the laws by words not by effects they take a meaning and get to be very vivid when you come to apply them to yourself all hands shook their heads and looked disappointed some turned away no longer interested the orator said and this time in the tones of business not of sentiment an ye do not know your countrys laws it were time ye learned them ye are strangers to us ye will not deny that ye may be freemen we do not deny that but also ye may be slaves the law is clear it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves it requireth you to prove ye are not i said dear sir give us only time to send to astolat or give us only time to send to the valley of holiness peace good man these are extraordinary requests and you may not hope to have them granted it would cost much time and would unwarrantably inconvenience your master master idiot stormed the king i have no master i myself am the m silence for gods sake i got the words out in time to stop the king we were in trouble enough already it could not help us any to give these people the notion that we were lunatics there is no use in stringing out the details the earl put us up and sold us at auction this same infernal law had existed in our own south in my own time more than thirteen hundred years later and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that they were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery without the circumstance making any particular impression upon me but the minute law and the auction block came into my personal experience a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenly hellish well thats the way we are made yes we were sold at auction like swine in a big town and an active market we should have brought a good price but this place was utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me ashamed every time i think of it the king of england brought seven dollars and his prime minister nine whereas the king was easily worth twelve dollars and i as easily worth fifteen but that is the way things always go if you force a sale on a dull market i dont care what the property is you are going to make a poor business of it and you can make up your mind to it if the earl had had wit enough to however there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up on his account let him go for the present i took his number so to speak the slave dealer bought us both and hitched us onto that long chain of his and we constituted the rear of his procession we took up our line of march and passed out of cambenet at noon and it seemed to me unaccountably strange and odd that the king of england and his chief minister marching manacled and fettered and yoked in a slave convoy could move by all manner of idle men and women and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely and yet never attract a curious eye never provoke a single remark dear dear it only shows that there is nothing diviner about a king than there is about a tramp after all he is just a cheap and hollow artificiality when you dont know he is a king but reveal his quality and dear me it takes your very breath away to look at him i reckon we are all fools born so no doubt chapter xxxv a pitiful incident its a world of surprises the king brooded this was natural what would he brood about should you say why about the prodigious nature of his fall of course from the loftiest place in the world to the lowest from the most illustrious station in the world to the obscurest from the grandest vocation among men to the basest no i take my oath that the thing that graveled him most to start with was not this but the price he had fetched he couldnt seem to get over that seven dollars well it stunned me so when i first found it out that i couldnt believe it it didnt seem natural but as soon as my mental sight cleared and i got a right focus on it i saw i was mistaken it was natural for this reason a king is a mere artificiality and so a kings feelings like the impulses of an automatic doll are mere artificialities but as a man he is a reality and his feelings as a man are real not phantoms it shames the average man to be valued below his own estimate of his worth and the king certainly wasnt anything more than an average man if he was up that high confound him he wearied me with arguments to show that in anything like a fair market he would have fetched twenty five dollars sure a thing which was plainly nonsense and full or the baldest conceit i wasnt worth it myself but it was tender ground for me to argue on in fact i had to simply shirk argument and do the diplomatic instead i had to throw conscience aside and brazenly concede that he ought to have brought twenty five dollars whereas i was quite well aware that in all the ages the world had never seen a king that was worth half the money and during the next thirteen centuries wouldnt see one that was worth the fourth of it yes he tired me if he began to talk about the crops or about the recent weather or about the condition of politics or about dogs or cats or morals or theology no matter what i sighed for i knew what was coming he was going to get out of it a palliation of that tiresome seven dollar sale wherever we halted where there was a crowd he would give me a look which said plainly if that thing could be tried over again now with this kind of folk you would see a different result well when he was first sold it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven dollars but before he was done with his sweating and worrying i wished he had fetched a hundred the thing never got a chance to die for every day at one place or another possible purchasers looked us over and as often as any other way their comment on the king was something like this heres a two dollar and a half chump with a thirty dollar style pity but style was marketable at last this sort of remark produced an evil result our owner was a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be mended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king so he went to work to take the style out of his sacred majesty i could have given the man some valuable advice but i didnt you mustnt volunteer advice to a slave driver unless you want to damage the cause you are arguing for i had found it a sufficiently difficult job to reduce the kings style to a peasants style even when he was a willing and anxious pupil now then to undertake to reduce the kings style to a slaves style and by force go to it was a stately contract never mind the details it will save me trouble to let you imagine them i will only remark that at the end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club and fist had done their work well the kings body was a sight to see and to weep over but his spirit why it wasnt even phased even that dull clod of a slave driver was able to see that there can be such a thing as a slave who will remain a man till he dies whose bones you can break but whose manhood you cant this man found that from his first effort down to his latest he couldnt ever come within reach of the king but the king was ready to plunge for him and did it so he gave up at last and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired the fact is the king was a good deal more than a king he was a man and when a man is a man you cant knock it out of him we had a rough time for a month tramping to and fro in the earth and suffering and what englishman was the most interested in the slavery question by that time his grace the king yes from being the most indifferent he was become the most interested he was become the bitterest hater of the institution i had ever heard talk and so i ventured to ask once more a question which i had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that i had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further would he abolish slavery his answer was as sharp as before but it was music this time i shouldnt ever wish to hear pleasanter though the profanity was not good being awkwardly put together and with the crash word almost in the middle instead of at the end where of course it ought to have been i was ready and willing to get free now i hadnt wanted to get free any sooner no i cannot quite say that i had wanted to but i had not been willing to take desperate chances and had always dissuaded the king from them but now ah it was a new atmosphere liberty would be worth any cost that might be put upon it now i set about a plan and was straightway charmed with it it would require time yes and patience too a great deal of both one could invent quicker ways and fully as sure ones but none that would be as picturesque as this none that could be made so dramatic and so i was not going to give this one up it might delay us months but no matter i would carry it out or break something now and then we had an adventure one night we were overtaken by a snow storm while still a mile from the village we were making for almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog the driving snow was so thick you couldnt see a thing and we were soon lost the slave driver lashed us desperately for he saw ruin before him but his lashings only made matters worse for they drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor so we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where we were the storm continued until toward midnight then ceased by this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were dead and others past moving and threatened with death our master was nearly beside himself he stirred up the living and made us stand jump slap ourselves to restore our circulation and he helped as well as he could with his whip now came a diversion we heard shrieks and yells and soon a woman came running and crying and seeing our group she flung herself into our midst and begged for protection a mob of people came tearing after her some with torches and they said she was a witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black cat this poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked human she was so battered and bloody the mob wanted to burn her well now what do you suppose our master did when we closed around this poor creature to shelter her he saw his chance he said burn her here or they shouldnt have her at all imagine that they were willing they fastened her to a post they brought wood and piled it about her they applied the torch while she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters to her breast and our brute with a heart solely for business lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent life of that poor harmless mother that was the sort of master we had i took his number that snow storm cost him nine of his flock and he was more brutal to us than ever after that for many days together he was so enraged over his loss we had adventures all along one day we ran into a procession and such a procession all the riffraff of the kingdom seemed to be comprehended in it and all drunk at that in the van was a cart with a coffin in it and on the coffin sat a comely young girl of about eighteen suckling a baby which she squeezed to her breast in a passion of love every little while and every little while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down upon it and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her happy and content kneading her breast with its dimpled fat hand which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart men and women boys and girls trotted along beside or after the cart hooting shouting profane and ribald remarks singing snatches of foul song skipping dancing a very holiday of hellions a sickening sight we had struck a suburb of london outside the walls and this was a sample of one sort of london society our master secured a good place for us near the gallows a priest was in attendance and he helped the girl climb up and said comforting words to her and made the under sheriff provide a stool for her then he stood there by her on the gallows and for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his feet then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away on every side occupying the vacancies far and near and then began to tell the story of the case and there was pity in his voice how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land i remember every detail of what he said except the words he said it in and so i change it into my own words law is intended to mete out justice sometimes it fails this cannot be helped we can only grieve and be resigned and pray for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law and that his fellows may be few a law sends this poor young thing to death and it is right but another law had placed her where she must commit her crime or starve with her child and before god that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death a little while ago this young thing this child of eighteen years was as happy a wife and mother as any in england and her lips were blithe with song which is the native speech of glad and innocent hearts her young husband was as happy as she for he was doing his whole duty he worked early and late at his handicraft his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned he was prospering he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family he was adding his mite to the wealth of the nation by consent of a treacherous law instant destruction fell upon this holy home and swept it away that young husband was waylaid and impressed and sent to sea the wife knew nothing of it she sought him everywhere she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications of her tears the broken eloquence of her despair weeks dragged by she watching waiting hoping her mind going slowly to wreck under the burden of her misery little by little all her small possessions went for food when she could no longer pay her rent they turned her out of doors she begged while she had strength when she was starving at last and her milk failing she stole a piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent thinking to sell it and save her child but she was seen by the owner of the cloth she was put in jail and brought to trial the man testified to the facts a plea was made for her and her sorrowful story was told in her behalf she spoke too by permission and said she did steal the cloth but that her mind was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne with hunger all acts criminal or other swam meaningless through her brain and she knew nothing rightly except that she was so hungry for a moment all were touched and there was disposition to deal mercifully with her seeing that she was so young and friendless and her case so piteous and the law that robbed her of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her transgression but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas these things were all true and most pitiful as well still there was much small theft in these days and mistimed mercy here would be a danger to property oh my god is there no property in ruined homes and orphaned babes and broken hearts that british law holds precious and so he must require sentence when the judge put on his black cap the owner of the stolen linen rose trembling up his lip quivering his face as gray as ashes and when the awful words came he cried out oh poor child poor child i did not know it was death and fell as a tree falls when they lifted him up his reason was gone before the sun was set he had taken his own life a kindly man a man whose heart was right at bottom add his murder to this that is to be now done here and charge them both where they belong to the rulers and the bitter laws of britain the time is come my child let me pray over thee not for thee dear abused poor heart and innocent but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death who need it more after his prayer they put the noose around the young girls neck and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear because she was devouring the baby all the time wildly kissing it and snatching it to her face and her breast and drenching it with tears and half moaning half shrieking all the while and the baby crowing and laughing and kicking its feet with delight over what it took for romp and play even the hangman couldnt stand it but turned away when all was ready the priest gently pulled and tugged and forced the child out of the mothers arms and stepped quickly out of her reach but she clasped her hands and made a wild spring toward him with a shriek but the rope and the under sheriff held her short then she went on her knees and stretched out her hands and cried one more kiss oh my god one more one more it is the dying that begs it she got it she almost smothered the little thing and when they got it away again she cried out oh my child my darling it will die it has no home it has no father no friend no mother it has them all said that good priest all these will i be to it till i die you should have seen her face then gratitude lord what do you want with words to express that words are only painted fire a look is the fire itself she gave that look and carried it away to the treasury of heaven where all things that are divine belong chapter xxxvi an encounter in the dark london to a slave was a sufficiently interesting place it was merely a great big village and mainly mud and thatch the streets were muddy crooked unpaved the populace was an ever flocking and drifting swarm of rags and splendors of nodding plumes and shining armor the king had a palace there he saw the outside of it it made him sigh yes and swear a little in a poor juvenile sixth century way we saw knights and grandees whom we knew but they didnt know us in our rags and dirt and raw welts and bruises and wouldnt have recognized us if we had hailed them nor stopped to answer either it being unlawful to speak with slaves on a chain sandy passed within ten yards of me on a mule hunting for me i imagined but the thing which clean broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old barrack in a square while we were enduring the spectacle of a man being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies it was the sight of a newsboy and i couldnt get at him still i had one comfort here was proof that clarence was still alive and banging away i meant to be with him before long the thought was full of cheer i had one little glimpse of another thing one day which gave me a great uplift it was a wire stretching from housetop to housetop telegraph or telephone sure i did very much wish i had a little piece of it it was just what i needed in order to carry out my project of escape my idea was to get loose some night along with the king then gag and bind our master change clothes with him batter him into the aspect of a stranger hitch him to the slave chain assume possession of the property march to camelot and but you get my idea you see what a stunning dramatic surprise i would wind up with at the palace it was all feasible if i could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which i could shape into a lock pick i could then undo the lumbering padlocks with which our chains were fastened whenever i might choose but i never had any luck no such thing ever happened to fall in my way however my chance came at last a gentleman who had come twice before to dicker for me without result or indeed any approach to a result came again i was far from expecting ever to belong to him for the price asked for me from the time i was first enslaved was exorbitant and always provoked either anger or derision yet my master stuck stubbornly to it twenty two dollars he wouldnt bate a cent the king was greatly admired because of his grand physique but his kingly style was against him and he wasnt salable nobody wanted that kind of a slave i considered myself safe from parting from him because of my extravagant price no i was not expecting to ever belong to this gentleman whom i have spoken of but he had something which i expected would belong to me eventually if he would but visit us often enough it was a steel thing with a long pin to it with which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in front there were three of them he had disappointed me twice because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project entirely safe but this time i succeeded i captured the lower clasp of the three and when he missed it he thought he had lost it on the way i had a chance to be glad about a minute then straightway a chance to be sad again for when the purchase was about to fail as usual the master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus in modern english i ll tell you what i ll do im tired supporting these two for no good give me twenty two dollars for this one and i ll throw the other one in the king couldnt get his breath he was in such a fury he began to choke and gag and meantime the master and the gentleman moved away discussing an ye will keep the offer open tis open till the morrow at this hour then i will answer you at that time said the gentleman and disappeared the master following him i had a time of it to cool the king down but i managed it i whispered in his ear to this effect your grace will go for nothing but after another fashion and so shall i to night we shall both be free ah how is that with this thing which i have stolen i will unlock these locks and cast off these chains to night when he comes about nine thirty to inspect us for the night we will seize him gag him batter him and early in the morning we will march out of this town proprietors of this caravan of slaves that was as far as i went but the king was charmed and satisfied that evening we waited patiently for our fellow slaves to get to sleep and signify it by the usual sign for you must not take many chances on those poor fellows if you can avoid it it is best to keep your own secrets no doubt they fidgeted only about as usual but it didnt seem so to me it seemed to me that they were going to be forever getting down to their regular snoring as the time dragged on i got nervously afraid we shouldnt have enough of it left for our needs so i made several premature attempts and merely delayed things by it for i couldnt seem to touch a padlock there in the dark without starting a rattle out of it which interrupted somebodys sleep and made him turn over and wake some more of the gang but finally i did get my last iron off and was a free man once more i took a good breath of relief and reached for the kings irons too late in comes the master with a light in one hand and his heavy walking staff in the other i snuggled close among the wallow of snorers to conceal as nearly as possible that i was naked of irons and i kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring for my man the moment he should bend over me but he didnt approach he stopped gazed absently toward our dusky mass a minute evidently thinking about something else then set down his light moved musingly toward the door and before a body could imagine what he was going to do he was out of the door and had closed it behind him quick said the king fetch him back of course it was the thing to do and i was up and out in a moment but dear me there were no lamps in those days and it was a dark night but i glimpsed a dim figure a few steps away i darted for it threw myself upon it and then there was a state of things and lively we fought and scuffled and struggled and drew a crowd in no time they took an immense interest in the fight and encouraged us all they could and in fact couldnt have been pleasanter or more cordial if it had been their own fight then a tremendous row broke out behind us and as much as half of our audience left us with a rush to invest some sympathy in that lanterns began to swing in all directions it was the watch gathering from far and near presently a halberd fell across my back as a reminder and i knew what it meant i was in custody so was my adversary we were marched off toward prison one on each side of the watchman here was disaster here was a fine scheme gone to sudden destruction i tried to imagine what would happen when the master should discover that it was i who had been fighting him and what would happen if they jailed us together in the general apartment for brawlers and petty law breakers as was the custom and what might just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction the freckled light from the watchmans tin lantern fell on it and by george he was the wrong man chapter xxxvii an awful predicament sleep it was impossible it would naturally have been impossible in that noisome cavern of a jail with its mangy crowd of drunken quarrelsome and song singing rapscallions but the thing that made sleep all the more a thing not to be dreamed of was my racking impatience to get out of this place and find out the whole size of what might have happened yonder in the slave quarters in consequence of that intolerable miscarriage of mine it was a long night but the morning got around at last i made a full and frank explanation to the court i said i was a slave the property of the great earl grip who had arrived just after dark at the tabard inn in the village on the other side of the water and had stopped there over night by compulsion he being taken deadly sick with a strange and sudden disorder i had been ordered to cross to the city in all haste and bring the best physician i was doing my best naturally i was running with all my might the night was dark i ran against this common person here who seized me by the throat and began to pummel me although i told him my errand and implored him for the sake of the great earl my masters mortal peril the common person interrupted and said it was a lie and was going to explain how i rushed upon him and attacked him without a word silence sirrah from the court take him hence and give him a few stripes whereby to teach him how to treat the servant of a nobleman after a different fashion another time go then the court begged my pardon and hoped i would not fail to tell his lordship it was in no wise the courts fault that this high handed thing had happened i said i would make it all right and so took my leave took it just in time too he was starting to ask me why i didnt fetch out these facts the moment i was arrested i said i would if i had thought of it which was true but that i was so battered by that man that all my wit was knocked out of me and so forth and so on and got myself away still mumbling i didnt wait for breakfast no grass grew under my feet i was soon at the slave quarters empty everybody gone that is everybody except one body the slave masters it lay there all battered to pulp and all about were the evidences of a terrific fight there was a rude board coffin on a cart at the door and workmen assisted by the police were thinning a road through the gaping crowd in order that they might bring it in i picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk with one so shabby as i and got his account of the matter there were sixteen slaves here they rose against their master in the night and thou seest how it ended yes how did it begin there was no witness but the slaves they said the slave that was most valuable got free of his bonds and escaped in some strange way by magic arts twas thought by reason that he had no key and the locks were neither broke nor in any wise injured when the master discovered his loss he was mad with despair and threw himself upon his people with his heavy stick who resisted and brake his back and in other and divers ways did give him hurts that brought him swiftly to his end this is dreadful it will go hard with the slaves no doubt upon the trial marry the trial is over over would they be a week think you and the matter so simple they were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it why i dont see how they could determine which were the guilty ones in so short a time which ones indeed they considered not particulars like to that they condemned them in a body wit ye not the law which men say the romans left behind them here when they went that if one slave killeth his master all the slaves of that man must die for it true i had forgotten and when will these die belike within a four and twenty hours albeit some say they will wait a pair of days more if peradventure they may find the missing one meantime the missing one it made me feel uncomfortable is it likely they will find him before the day is spent yes they seek him everywhere they stand at the gates of the town with certain of the slaves who will discover him to them if he cometh and none can pass out but he will be first examined might one see the place where the rest are confined the outside of it yes the inside of it but ye will not want to see that i took the address of that prison for future reference and then sauntered off at the first second hand clothing shop i came to up a back street i got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman who might be going on a cold voyage and bound up my face with a liberal bandage saying i had a toothache this concealed my worst bruises it was a transformation i no longer resembled my former self then i struck out for that wire found it and followed it to its den it was a little room over a butchers shop which meant that business wasnt very brisk in the telegraphic line the young chap in charge was drowsing at his table i locked the door and put the vast key in my bosom this alarmed the young fellow and he was going to make a noise but i said save your wind if you open your mouth you are dead sure tackle your instrument lively now call camelot this doth amaze me how should such as you know aught of such matters as call camelot i am a desperate man call camelot or get away from the instrument and i will do it myself what you yes certainly stop gabbling call the palace he made the call now then call clarence clarence who never mind clarence who say you want clarence you ll get an answer he did so we waited five nerve straining minutes ten minutes how long it did seem and then came a click that was as familiar to me as a human voice for clarence had been my own pupil now my lad vacate they would have known my touch maybe and so your call was surest but im all right now he vacated the place and cocked his ear to listen but it didnt win i used a cipher i didnt waste any time in sociabilities with clarence but squared away for business straight off thus the king is here and in danger we were captured and brought here as slaves we should not be able to prove our identity and the fact is i am not in a position to try send a telegram for the palace here which will carry conviction with it his answer came straight back they dont know anything about the telegraph they havent had any experience yet the line to london is so new better not venture that they might hang you think up something else might hang us little he knew how closely he was crowding the facts i couldnt think up anything for the moment then an idea struck me and i started it along send five hundred picked knights with launcelot in the lead and send them on the jump let them enter by the southwest gate and look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm the answer was prompt they shall start in half an hour all right clarence now tell this lad here that im a friend of yours and a dead head and that he must be discreet and say nothing about this visit of mine the instrument began to talk to the youth and i hurried away i fell to ciphering in half an hour it would be nine o clock knights and horses in heavy armor couldnt travel very fast these would make the best time they could and now that the ground was in good condition and no snow or mud they would probably make a seven mile gait they would have to change horses a couple of times they would arrive about six or a little after it would still be plenty light enough they would see the white cloth which i should tie around my right arm and i would take command we would surround that prison and have the king out in no time it would be showy and picturesque enough all things considered though i would have preferred noonday on account of the more theatrical aspect the thing would have now then in order to increase the strings to my bow i thought i would look up some of those people whom i had formerly recognized and make myself known that would help us out of our scrape without the knights but i must proceed cautiously for it was a risky business i must get into sumptuous raiment and it wouldnt do to run and jump into it no i must work up to it by degrees buying suit after suit of clothes in shops wide apart and getting a little finer article with each change until i should finally reach silk and velvet and be ready for my project so i started but the scheme fell through like scat the first corner i turned i came plump upon one of our slaves snooping around with a watchman i coughed at the moment and he gave me a sudden look that bit right into my marrow i judge he thought he had heard that cough before i turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter pricing things and watching out of the corner of my eye those people had stopped and were talking together and looking in at the door i made up my mind to get out the back way if there was a back way and i asked the shopwoman if i could step out there and look for the escaped slave who was believed to be in hiding back there somewhere and said i was an officer in disguise and my pard was yonder at the door with one of the murderers in charge and would she be good enough to step there and tell him he neednt wait but had better go at once to the further end of the back alley and be ready to head him off when i rousted him out she was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated murderers and she started on the errand at once i slipped out the back way locked the door behind me put the key in my pocket and started off chuckling to myself and comfortable well i had gone and spoiled it again made another mistake a double one in fact there were plenty of ways to get rid of that officer by some simple and plausible device but no i must pick out a picturesque one it is the crying defect of my character and then i had ordered my procedure upon what the officer being human would naturally do whereas when you are least expecting it a man will now and then go and do the very thing which its not natural for him to do the natural thing for the officer to do in this case was to follow straight on my heels he would find a stout oaken door securely locked between him and me before he could break it down i should be far away and engaged in slipping into a succession of baffling disguises which would soon get me into a sort of raiment which was a surer protection from meddling law dogs in britain than any amount of mere innocence and purity of character but instead of doing the natural thing the officer took me at my word and followed my instructions and so as i came trotting out of that cul de sac full of satisfaction with my own cleverness he turned the corner and i walked right into his handcuffs if i had known it was a cul de sac however there isnt any excusing a blunder like that let it go charge it up to profit and loss of course i was indignant and swore i had just come ashore from a long voyage and all that sort of thing just to see you know if it would deceive that slave but it didnt he knew me then i reproached him for betraying me he was more surprised than hurt he stretched his eyes wide and said what wouldst have me let thee of all men escape and not hang with us when thou rt the very cause of our hanging go to go to was their way of saying i should smile or i like that queer talkers those people well there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case and so i dropped the matter when you cant cure a disaster by argument what is the use to argue it isnt my way so i only said you re not going to be hanged none of us are both men laughed and the slave said ye have not ranked as a fool before you might better keep your reputation seeing the strain would not be for long it will stand it i reckon before to morrow we shall be out of prison and free to go where we will besides the witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb made a rasping noise in his throat and said out of prison yes ye say true and free likewise to go where ye will so ye wander not out of his grace the devils sultry realm i kept my temper and said indifferently now i suppose you really think we are going to hang within a day or two i thought it not many minutes ago for so the thing was decided and proclaimed ah then you ve changed your mind is that it even that i only thought then i know now i felt sarcastical so i said oh sapient servant of the law condescend to tell us then what you know that ye will all be hanged to day at mid afternoon oho that shot hit home lean upon me the fact is i did need to lean upon somebody my knights couldnt arrive in time they would be as much as three hours too late nothing in the world could save the king of england nor me which was more important more important not merely to me but to the nation the only nation on earth standing ready to blossom into civilization i was sick i said no more there wasnt anything to say i knew what the man meant that if the missing slave was found the postponement would be revoked the execution take place to day well the missing slave was found chapter xxxviii sir launcelot and knights to the rescue nearing four in the afternoon the scene was just outside the walls of london a cool comfortable superb day with a brilliant sun the kind of day to make one want to live not die the multitude was prodigious and far reaching and yet we fifteen poor devils hadnt a friend in it there was something painful in that thought look at it how you might there we sat on our tall scaffold the butt of the hate and mockery of all those enemies we were being made a holiday spectacle they had built a sort of grand stand for the nobility and gentry and these were there in full force with their ladies we recognized a good many of them the crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of the king the moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up in his fantastic rags with face bruised out of all recognition and proclaimed himself arthur king of britain and denounced the awful penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair of his sacred head were touched it startled and surprised him to hear them break into a vast roar of laughter it wounded his dignity and he locked himself up in silence then although the crowd begged him to go on and tried to provoke him to it by catcalls jeers and shouts of let him speak the king the king his humble subjects hunger and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master his serene and sacred raggedness but it went for nothing he put on all his majesty and sat under this rain of contempt and insult unmoved he certainly was great in his way absently i had taken off my white bandage and wound it about my right arm when the crowd noticed this they began upon me they said doubtless this sailor man is his minister observe his costly badge of office i let them go on until they got tired and then i said yes i am his minister the boss and to morrow you will hear that from camelot which i got no further they drowned me out with joyous derision but presently there was silence for the sheriffs of london in their official robes with their subordinates began to make a stir which indicated that business was about to begin in the hush which followed our crime was recited the death warrant read then everybody uncovered while a priest uttered a prayer then a slave was blindfolded the hangman unslung his rope there lay the smooth road below us we upon one side of it the banked multitude wailing its other side a good clear road and kept free by the police how good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen come tearing down it but no it was out of the possibilities i followed its receding thread out into the distance not a horseman on it or sign of one there was a jerk and the slave hung dangling dangling and hideously squirming for his limbs were not tied a second rope was unslung in a moment another slave was dangling in a minute a third slave was struggling in the air it was dreadful i turned away my head a moment and when i turned back i missed the king they were blindfolding him i was paralyzed i couldnt move i was choking my tongue was petrified they finished blindfolding him they led him under the rope i couldnt shake off that clinging impotence but when i saw them put the noose around his neck then everything let go in me and i made a spring to the rescue and as i made it i shot one more glance abroad by george here they came a tilting five hundred mailed and belted knights on bicycles the grandest sight that ever was seen lord how the plumes streamed how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession of webby wheels i waved my right arm as launcelot swept in he recognized my rag i tore away noose and bandage and shouted on your knees every rascal of you and salute the king who fails shall sup in hell to night i always use that high style when im climaxing an effect well it was noble to see launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard and it was fine to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg their lives of the king they had just been deriding and insulting and as he stood apart there receiving this homage in rags i thought to myself well really there is something peculiarly grand about the gait and bearing of a king after all i was immensely satisfied take the whole situation all around it was one of the gaudiest effects i ever instigated and presently up comes clarence his own self and winks and says very modernly good deal of a surprise wasnt it i knew youd like it i ve had the boys practicing this long time privately and just hungry for a chance to show off chapter xxxix the yankees fight with the knights home again at camelot a morning or two later i found the paper damp from the press by my plate at the breakfast table i turned to the advertising columns knowing i should find something of personal interest to me there it was this de par le roi know that the great lord and illus trious kni ht sir sagramor le desirous having condescended to meet the kings minister hank mor gan the which is surnamed the boss for satisfgction of offence anciently given these will engage in the lists by camelot about the

combatant to use any weapon he may pre fer you may want to make a note of that up to the day set there was no talk in all britain of anything but this combat all other topics sank into insignificance and passed out of mens thoughts and interest it was not because a tournament was a great matter it was not because sir sagramor had found the holy grail for he had not but had failed it was not because the second official personage in the kingdom was one of the duellists no all these features were commonplace yet there was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest which this coming fight was creating it was born of the fact that all the nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men so to speak but a duel between two mighty magicians a duel not of muscle but of mind not of human skill but of superhuman art and craft a final struggle for supremacy between the two master enchanters of the age it was realized that the most prodigious achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy of comparison with a spectacle like this they could be but childs play contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods yes all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel between merlin and me a measuring of his magic powers against mine it was known that merlin had been busy whole days and nights together imbuing sir sagramors arms and armor with supernal powers of offense and defense and that he had procured for him from the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the wearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to other men against sir sagramor so weaponed and protected a thousand knights could accomplish nothing against him no known enchantments could prevail these facts were sure regarding them there was no doubt no reason for doubt there was but one question might there be still other enchantments unknown to merlin which could render sir sagramors veil transparent to me and make his enchanted mail vulnerable to my weapons this was the one thing to be decided in the lists until then the world must remain in suspense so the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here and the world was right but it was not the one they had in their minds no a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die the life of knight errantry i was a champion it was true but not the champion of the frivolous black arts i was the champion of hard unsentimental common sense and reason i was entering the lists to either destroy knight errantry or be its victim vast as the show grounds were there were no vacant spaces in them outside of the lists at ten o clock on the morning of the th the mammoth grand stand was clothed in flags streamers and rich tapestries and packed with several acres of small fry tributary kings their suites and the british aristocracy with our own royal gang in the chief place and each and every individual a flashing prism of gaudy silks and velvets well i never saw anything to begin with it but a fight between an upper mississippi sunset and the aurora borealis the huge camp of beflagged and gay colored tents at one end of the lists with a stiff standing sentinel at every door and a shining shield hanging by him for challenge was another fine sight you see every knight was there who had any ambition or any caste feeling for my feeling toward their order was not much of a secret and so here was their chance if i won my fight with sir sagramor others would have the right to call me out as long as i might be willing to respond down at our end there were but two tents one for me and another for my servants at the appointed hour the king made a sign and the heralds in their tabards appeared and made proclamation naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel there was a pause then a ringing bugle blast which was the signal for us to come forth all the multitude caught their breath and an eager curiosity flashed into every face out from his tent rode great sir sagramor an imposing tower of iron stately and rigid his huge spear standing upright in its socket and grasped in his strong hand his grand horses face and breast cased in steel his body clothed in rich trappings that almost dragged the ground oh a most noble picture a great shout went up of welcome and admiration and then out i came but i didnt get any shout there was a wondering and eloquent silence for a moment then a great wave of laughter began to sweep along that human sea but a warning bugle blast cut its career short i was in the simplest and comfortablest of gymnast costumes flesh colored tights from neck to heel with blue silk puffings about my loins and bareheaded my horse was not above medium size but he was alert slender limbed muscled with watchsprings and just a greyhound to go he was a beauty glossy as silk and naked as he was when he was born except for bridle and ranger saddle the iron tower and the gorgeous bedquilt came cumbrously but gracefully pirouetting down the lists and we tripped lightly up to meet them we halted the tower saluted i responded then we wheeled and rode side by side to the grand stand and faced our king and queen to whom we made obeisance the queen exclaimed alack sir boss wilt fight naked and without lance or sword or but the king checked her and made her understand with a polite phrase or two that this was none of her business the bugles rang again and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists and took position now old merlin stepped into view and cast a dainty web of gossamer threads over sir sagramor which turned him into hamlets ghost the king made a sign the bugles blew sir sagramor laid his great lance in rest and the next moment here he came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind and i went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him cocking my ear the while as if noting the invisible knights position and progress by hearing not sight a chorus of encouraging shouts burst out for him and one brave voice flung out a heartening word for me said go it slim jim it was an even bet that clarence had procured that favor for me and furnished the language too when that formidable lance point was within a yard and a half of my breast i twitched my horse aside without an effort and the big knight swept by scoring a blank i got plenty of applause that time we turned braced up and down we came again another blank for the knight a roar of applause for me this same thing was repeated once more and it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that sir sagramor lost his temper and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task of chasing me down why he hadnt any show in the world at that it was a game of tag with all the advantage on my side i whirled out of his path with ease whenever i chose and once i slapped him on the back as i went to the rear finally i took the chase into my own hands and after that turn or twist or do what he would he was never able to get behind me again he found himself always in front at the end of his maneuver so he gave up that business and retired to his end of the lists his temper was clear gone now and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed of mine i slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle and grasped the coil in my right hand this time you should have seen him come it was a business trip sure by his gait there was blood in his eye i was sitting my horse at ease and swinging the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head the moment he was under way i started for him when the space between us had narrowed to forty feet i sent the snaky spirals of the rope a cleaving through the air then darted aside and faced about and brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under him for a surge the next moment the rope sprang taut and yanked sir sagramor out of the saddle great scott but there was a sensation unquestionably the popular thing in this world is novelty these people had never seen anything of that cowboy business before and it carried them clear off their feet with delight from all around and everywhere the shout went up encore encore i wondered where they got the word but there was no time to cipher on philological matters because the whole knight errantry hive was just humming now and my prospect for trade couldnt have been better the moment my lasso was released and sir sagramor had been assisted to his tent i hauled in the slack took my station and began to swing my loop around my head again i was sure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successor for sir sagramor and that couldnt take long where there were so many hungry candidates indeed they elected one straight off sir hervis de revel bzz here he came like a house afire i dodged he passed like a flash with my horse hair coils settling around his neck a second or so later fst his saddle was empty i got another encore and another and another and still another when i had snaked five men out things began to look serious to the ironclads and they stopped and consulted together as a result they decided that it was time to waive etiquette and send their greatest and best against me to the astonishment of that little world i lassoed sir lamorak de galis and after him sir galahad so you see there was simply nothing to be done now but play their right bower bring out the superbest of the superb the mightiest of the mighty the great sir launcelot himself a proud moment for me i should think so yonder was arthur king of britain yonder was guenever yes and whole tribes of little provincial kings and kinglets and in the tented camp yonder renowned knights from many lands and likewise the selectest body known to chivalry the knights of the table round the most illustrious in christendom and biggest fact of all the very sun of their shining system was yonder couching his lance the focal point of forty thousand adoring eyes and all by myself here was i laying for him across my mind flitted the dear image of a certain hello girl of west hartford and i wished she could see me now in that moment down came the invincible with the rush of a whirlwind the courtly world rose to its feet and bent forward the fateful coils went circling through the air and before you could wink i was towing sir launcelot across the field on his back and kissing my hand to the storm of waving kerchiefs and the thunder crash of applause that greeted me said i to myself as i coiled my lariat and hung it on my saddle horn and sat there drunk with glory the victory is perfect no other will venture against me knight errantry is dead now imagine my astonishment and everybody elses too to hear the peculiar bugle call which announces that another competitor is about to enter the lists there was a mystery here i couldnt account for this thing next i noticed merlin gliding away from me and then i noticed that my lasso was gone the old sleight of hand expert had stolen it sure and slipped it under his robe the bugle blew again i looked and down came sagramor riding again with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely re arranged i trotted up to meet him and pretended to find him by the sound of his horses hoofs he said thou rt quick of ear but it will not save thee from this and he touched the hilt of his great sword an ye are not able to see it because of the influence of the veil know that it is no cumbrous lance but a sword and i ween ye will not be able to avoid it his visor was up there was death in his smile i should never be able to dodge his sword that was plain somebody was going to die this time if he got the drop on me i could name the corpse we rode forward together and saluted the royalties this time the king was disturbed he said where is thy strange weapon it is stolen sire hast another at hand no sire i brought only the one then merlin mixed in he brought but the one because there was but the one to bring there exists none other but that one it belongeth to the king of the demons of the sea this man is a pretender and ignorant else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts only and then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea then is he weaponless said the king sir sagramore ye will grant him leave to borrow and i will lend said sir launcelot limping up he is as brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live and he shall have mine he put his hand on his sword to draw it but sir sagramor said stay it may not be he shall fight with his own weapons it was his privilege to choose them and bring them if he has erred on his head be it knight said the king thou rt overwrought with passion it disorders thy mind wouldst kill a naked man an he do it he shall answer it to me said sir launcelot i will answer it to any he that desireth retorted sir sagramor hotly merlin broke in rubbing his hands and smiling his lowdownest smile of malicious gratification tis well said right well said and tis enough of parleying let my lord the king deliver the battle signal the king had to yield the bugle made proclamation and we turned apart and rode to our stations there we stood a hundred yards apart facing each other rigid and motionless like horsed statues and so we remained in a soundless hush as much as a full minute everybody gazing nobody stirring it seemed as if the king could not take heart to give the signal but at last he lifted his hand the clear note of the bugle followed sir sagramors long blade described a flashing curve in the air and it was superb to see him come i sat still on he came i did not move people got so excited that they shouted to me fly fly save thyself this is murther i never budged so much as an inch till that thundering apparition had got within fifteen paces of me then i snatched a dragoon revolver out of my holster there was a flash and a roar and the revolver was back in the holster before anybody could tell what had happened here was a riderless horse plunging by and yonder lay sir sagramor stone dead the people that ran to him were stricken dumb to find that the life was actually gone out of the man and no reason for it visible no hurt upon his body nothing like a wound there was a hole through the breast of his chain mail but they attached no importance to a little thing like that and as a bullet wound there produces but little blood none came in sight because of the clothing and swaddlings under the armor the body was dragged over to let the king and the swells look down upon it they were stupefied with astonishment naturally i was requested to come and explain the miracle but i remained in my tracks like a statue and said if it is a command i will come but my lord the king knows that i am where the laws of combat require me to remain while any desire to come against me i waited nobody challenged then i said if there are any who doubt that this field is well and fairly won i do not wait for them to challenge me i challenge them it is a gallant offer said the king and well beseems you whom will you name first i name none i challenge all here i stand and dare the chivalry of england to come against me not by individuals but in mass what shouted a score of knights you have heard the challenge take it or i proclaim you recreant knights and vanquished every one it was a bluff you know at such a time it is sound judgment to put on a bold face and play your hand for a hundred times what it is worth forty nine times out of fifty nobody dares to call and you rake in the chips but just this once well things looked squally in just no time five hundred knights were scrambling into their saddles and before you could wink a widely scattering drove were under way and clattering down upon me i snatched both revolvers from the holsters and began to measure distances and calculate chances bang one saddle empty bang another one bang bang and i bagged two well it was nip and tuck with us and i knew it if i spent the eleventh shot without convincing these people the twelfth man would kill me sure and so i never did feel so happy as i did when my ninth downed its man and i detected the wavering in the crowd which is premonitory of panic an instant lost now could knock out my last chance but i didnt lose it i raised both revolvers and pointed them the halted host stood their ground just about one good square moment then broke and fled the day was mine knight errantry was a doomed institution the march of civilization was begun how did i feel ah you never could imagine it and brer merlin his stock was flat again somehow every time the magic of fol de rol tried conclusions with the magic of science the magic of fol de rol got left chapter xl three years later when i broke the back of knight errantry that time i no longer felt obliged to work in secret so the very next day i exposed my hidden schools my mines and my vast system of clandestine factories and workshops to an astonished world that is to say i exposed the nineteenth century to the inspection of the sixth well it is always a good plan to follow up an advantage promptly the knights were temporarily down but if i would keep them so i must just simply paralyze them nothing short of that would answer you see i was bluffing that last time in the field it would be natural for them to work around to that conclusion if i gave them a chance so i must not give them time and i didnt i renewed my challenge engraved it on brass posted it up where any priest could read it to them and also kept it standing in the advertising columns of the paper i not only renewed it but added to its proportions i said name the day and i would take fifty assistants and stand up against the massed chivalry of the whole earth and destroy it i was not bluffing this time i meant what i said i could do what i promised there wasnt any way to misunderstand the language of that challenge even the dullest of the chivalry perceived that this was a plain case of put up or shut up they were wise and did the latter in all the next three years they gave me no trouble worth mentioning consider the three years sped now look around on england a happy and prosperous country and strangely altered schools everywhere and several colleges a number of pretty good newspapers even authorship was taking a start sir dinadan the humorist was first in the field with a volume of gray headed jokes which i had been familiar with during thirteen centuries if he had left out that old rancid one about the lecturer i wouldnt have said anything but i couldnt stand that one i suppressed the book and hanged the author slavery was dead and gone all men were equal before the law taxation had been equalized the telegraph the telephone the phonograph the typewriter the sewing machine and all the thousand willing and handy servants of steam and electricity were working their way into favor we had a steamboat or two on the thames we had steam warships and the beginnings of a steam commercial marine i was getting ready to send out an expedition to discover america we were building several lines of railway and our line from camelot to london was already finished and in operation i was shrewd enough to make all offices connected with the passenger service places of high and distinguished honor my idea was to attract the chivalry and nobility and make them useful and keep them out of mischief the plan worked very well the competition for the places was hot the conductor of the express was a duke there wasnt a passenger conductor on the line below the degree of earl they were good men every one but they had two defects which i couldnt cure and so had to wink at they wouldnt lay aside their armor and they would knock down fare i mean rob the company there was hardly a knight in all the land who wasnt in some useful employment they were going from end to end of the country in all manner of useful missionary capacities their penchant for wandering and their experience in it made them altogether the most effective spreaders of civilization we had they went clothed in steel and equipped with sword and lance and battle axe and if they couldnt persuade a person to try a sewing machine on the installment plan or a melodeon or a barbed wire fence or a prohibition journal or any of the other thousand and one things they canvassed for they removed him and passed on i was very happy things were working steadily toward a secretly longed for point you see i had two schemes in my head which were the vastest of all my projects the one was to overthrow the catholic church and set up the protestant faith on its ruins not as an established church but a go as you please one and the other project was to get a decree issued by and by commanding that upon arthurs death unlimited suffrage should be introduced and given to men and women alike at any rate to all men wise or unwise and to all mothers who at middle age should be found to know nearly as much as their sons at twenty one arthur was good for thirty years yet he being about my own age that is to say forty and i believed that in that time i could easily have the active part of the population of that day ready and eager for an event which should be the first of its kind in the history of the world a rounded and complete governmental revolution without bloodshed the result to be a republic well i may as well confess though i do feel ashamed when i think of it i was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first president myself yes there was more or less human nature in me i found that out clarence was with me as concerned the revolution but in a modified way his idea was a republic without privileged orders but with a hereditary royal family at the head of it instead of an elective chief magistrate he believed that no nation that had ever known the joy of worshiping a royal family could ever be robbed of it and not fade away and die of melancholy i urged that kings were dangerous he said then have cats he was sure that a royal family of cats would answer every purpose they would be as useful as any other royal family they would know as much they would have the same virtues and the same treacheries the same disposition to get up shindies with other royal cats they would be laughably vain and absurd and never know it they would be wholly inexpensive finally they would have as sound a divine right as any other royal house and tom vii or tom xi or tom xiv by the grace of god king would sound as well as it would when applied to the ordinary royal tomcat with tights on and as a rule said he in his neat modern english the character of these cats would be considerably above the character of the average king and this would be an immense moral advantage to the nation for the reason that a nation always models its morals after its monarchs the worship of royalty being founded in unreason these graceful and harmless cats would easily become as sacred as any other royalties and indeed more so because it would presently be noticed that they hanged nobody beheaded nobody imprisoned nobody inflicted no cruelties or injustices of any sort and so must be worthy of a deeper love and reverence than the customary human king and would certainly get it the eyes of the whole harried world would soon be fixed upon this humane and gentle system and royal butchers would presently begin to disappear their subjects would fill the vacancies with catlings from our own royal house we should become a factory we should supply the thrones of the world within forty years all europe would be governed by cats and we should furnish the cats the reign of universal peace would begin then to end no more forever me e e yow ow ow ow fzt wow hang him i supposed he was in earnest and was beginning to be persuaded by him until he exploded that cat howl and startled me almost out of my clothes but he never could be in earnest he didnt know what it was he had pictured a distinct and perfectly rational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy but he was too feather headed to know it or care anything about it either i was going to give him a scolding but sandy came flying in at that moment wild with terror and so choked with sobs that for a minute she could not get her voice i ran and took her in my arms and lavished caresses upon her and said beseechingly speak darling speak what is it her head fell limp upon my bosom and she gasped almost inaudibly hello central quick i shouted to clarence telephone the kings homeopath to come in two minutes i was kneeling by the childs crib and sandy was dispatching servants here there and everywhere all over the palace i took in the situation almost at a glance membranous croup i bent down and whispered wake up sweetheart hello central she opened her soft eyes languidly and made out to say papa that was a comfort she was far from dead yet i sent for preparations of sulphur i rousted out the croup kettle myself for i dont sit down and wait for doctors when sandy or the child is sick i knew how to nurse both of them and had had experience this little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life and often i could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh through the tear dews on its eye lashes when even its mother couldnt sir launcelot in his richest armor came striding along the great hall now on his way to the stock board he was president of the stock board and occupied the siege perilous which he had bought of sir galahad for the stock board consisted of the knights of the round table and they used the round table for business purposes now seats at it were worth well you would never believe the figure so it is no use to state it sir launcelot was a bear and he had put up a corner in one of the new lines and was just getting ready to squeeze the shorts to day but what of that he was the same old launcelot and when he glanced in as he was passing the door and found out that his pet was sick that was enough for him bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all him he would come right in here and stand by little hello central for all he was worth and that was what he did he shied his helmet into the corner and in half a minute he had a new wick in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the croup kettle by this time sandy had built a blanket canopy over the crib and everything was ready sir launcelot got up steam he and i loaded up the kettle with unslaked lime and carbolic acid with a touch of lactic acid added thereto then filled the thing up with water and inserted the steam spout under the canopy everything was ship shape now and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch sandy was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple of church wardens with willow bark and sumach tobacco for us and told us to smoke as much as we pleased it couldnt get under the canopy and she was used to smoke being the first lady in the land who had ever seen a cloud blown well there couldnt be a more contented or comfortable sight than sir launcelot in his noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard of snowy church warden he was a beautiful man a lovely man and was just intended to make a wife and children happy but of course guenever however its no use to cry over whats done and cant be helped well he stood watch and watch with me right straight through for three days and nights till the child was out of danger then he took her up in his great arms and kissed her with his plumes falling about her golden head then laid her softly in sandys lap again and took his stately way down the vast hall between the ranks of admiring men at arms and menials and so disappeared and no instinct warned me that i should never look upon him again in this world lord what a world of heart break it is the doctors said we must take the child away if we would coax her back to health and strength again and she must have sea air so we took a man of war and a suite of two hundred and sixty persons and went cruising about and after a fortnight of this we stepped ashore on the french coast and the doctors thought it would be a good idea to make something of a stay there the little king of that region offered us his hospitalities and we were glad to accept if he had had as many conveniences as he lacked we should have been plenty comfortable enough even as it was we made out very well in his queer old castle by the help of comforts and luxuries from the ship at the end of a month i sent the vessel home for fresh supplies and for news we expected her back in three or four days she would bring me along with other news the result of a certain experiment which i had been starting it was a project of mine to replace the tournament with something which might furnish an escape for the extra steam of the chivalry keep those bucks entertained and out of mischief and at the same time preserve the best thing in them which was their hardy spirit of emulation i had had a choice band of them in private training for some time and the date was now arriving for their first public effort this experiment was baseball in order to give the thing vogue from the start and place it out of the reach of criticism i chose my nines by rank not capacity there wasnt a knight in either team who wasnt a sceptered sovereign as for material of this sort there was a glut of it always around arthur you couldnt throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king of course i couldnt get these people to leave off their armor they wouldnt do that when they bathed they consented to differentiate the armor so that a body could tell one team from the other but that was the most they would do so one of the teams wore chain mail ulsters and the other wore plate armor made of my new bessemer steel their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing i ever saw being ball proof they never skipped out of the way but stood still and took the result when a bessemer was at the bat and a ball hit him it would bound a hundred and fifty yards sometimes and when a man was running and threw himself on his stomach to slide to his base it was like an iron clad coming into port at first i appointed men of no rank to act as umpires but i had to discontinue that these people were no easier to please than other nines the umpires first decision was usually his last they broke him in two with a bat and his friends toted him home on a shutter when it was noticed that no umpire ever survived a game umpiring got to be unpopular so i was obliged to appoint somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would protect him here are the names of the nines bessemers ulsters king arthur emperor lucius king lot of lothian king logris king of northgalis king marhalt of ireland king marsil king morganore king of little britain king mark of cornwall king labor king nentres of garlot king pellam of listengese king meliodas of liones king bagdemagus king of the lake king tolleme la feintes the sowdan of syria umpire clarence the first public game would certainly draw fifty thousand people and for solid fun would be worth going around the world to see everything would be favorable it was balmy and beautiful spring weather now and nature was all tailored out in her new clothes chapter xli the interdict however my attention was suddenly snatched from such matters our child began to lose ground again and we had to go to sitting up with her her case became so serious we couldnt bear to allow anybody to help in this service so we two stood watch and watch day in and day out ah sandy what a right heart she had how simple and genuine and good she was she was a flawless wife and mother and yet i had married her for no other particular reasons except that by the customs of chivalry she was my property until some knight should win her from me in the field she had hunted britain over for me had found me at the hanging bout outside of london and had straightway resumed her old place at my side in the placidest way and as of right i was a new englander and in my opinion this sort of partnership would compromise her sooner or later she couldnt see how but i cut argument short and we had a wedding now i didnt know i was drawing a prize yet that was what i did draw within the twelvemonth i became her worshiper and ours was the dearest and perfectest comradeship that ever was people talk about beautiful friendships between two persons of the same sex what is the best of that sort as compared with the friendship of man and wife where the best impulses and highest ideals of both are the same there is no place for comparison between the two friendships the one is earthly the other divine in my dreams along at first i still wandered thirteen centuries away and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and harking all up and down the unreplying vacancies of a vanished world many a time sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep with a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our child conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine it touched me to tears and it also nearly knocked me off my feet too when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward and played her quaint and pretty surprise upon me the name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved here made holy and the music of it will abide alway in our ears now thou lt kiss me as knowing the name i have given the child but i didnt know it all the same i hadnt an idea in the world but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her pretty game so i never let on but said yes i know sweetheart how dear and good it is of you too but i want to hear these lips of yours which are also mine utter it first then its music will be perfect pleased to the marrow she murmured hello central i didnt laugh i am always thankful for that but the strain ruptured every cartilage in me and for weeks afterward i could hear my bones clack when i walked she never found out her mistake the first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone she was surprised and not pleased but i told her i had given order for it that henceforth and forever the telephone must always be invoked with that reverent formality in perpetual honor and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake this was not true but it answered well during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib and in our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of that sick room then our reward came the center of the universe turned the corner and began to mend grateful it isnt the term there isnt any term for it you know that yourself if you ve watched your child through the valley of the shadow and seen it come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one all illuminating smile that you could cover with your hand why we were back in this world in one instant then we looked the same startled thought into each others eyes at the same moment more than two weeks gone and that ship not back yet in another minute i appeared in the presence of my train they had been steeped in troubled bodings all this time their faces showed it i called an escort and we galloped five miles to a hilltop overlooking the sea where was my great commerce that so lately had made these glistening expanses populous and beautiful with its white winged flocks vanished every one not a sail from verge to verge not a smoke bank just a dead and empty solitude in place of all that brisk and breezy life i went swiftly back saying not a word to anybody i told sandy this ghastly news we could imagine no explanation that would begin to explain had there been an invasion an earthquake a pestilence had the nation been swept out of existence but guessing was profitless i must go at once i borrowed the kings navy a ship no bigger than a steam launch and was soon ready the parting ah yes that was hard as i was devouring the child with last kisses it brisked up and jabbered out its vocabulary the first time in more than two weeks and it made fools of us for joy the darling mispronunciations of childhood dear me theres no music that can touch it and how one grieves when it wastes away and dissolves into correctness knowing it will never visit his bereaved ear again well how good it was to be able to carry that gracious memory away with me i approached england the next morning with the wide highway of salt water all to myself there were ships in the harbor at dover but they were naked as to sails and there was no sign of life about them it was sunday yet at canterbury the streets were empty strangest of all there was not even a priest in sight and no stroke of a bell fell upon my ear the mournfulness of death was everywhere i couldnt understand it at last in the further edge of that town i saw a small funeral procession just a family and a few friends following a coffin no priest a funeral without bell book or candle there was a church there close at hand but they passed it by weeping and did not enter it i glanced up at the belfry and there hung the bell shrouded in black and its tongue tied back now i knew now i understood the stupendous calamity that had overtaken england invasion invasion is a triviality to it it was the interdict i asked no questions i didnt need to ask any the church had struck the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise and go warily one of my servants gave me a suit of clothes and when we were safe beyond the town i put them on and from that time i traveled alone i could not risk the embarrassment of company a miserable journey a desolate silence everywhere even in london itself traffic had ceased men did not talk or laugh or go in groups or even in couples they moved aimlessly about each man by himself with his head down and woe and terror at his heart the tower showed recent war scars verily much had been happening of course i meant to take the train for camelot train why the station was as vacant as a cavern i moved on the journey to camelot was a repetition of what i had already seen the monday and the tuesday differed in no way from the sunday i arrived far in the night from being the best electric lighted town in the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever saw it was become simply a blot a blot upon darkness that is to say it was darker and solider than the rest of the darkness and so you could see it a little better it made me feel as if maybe it was symbolical a sort of sign that the church was going to keep the upper hand now and snuff out all my beautiful civilization just like that i found no life stirring in the somber streets i groped my way with a heavy heart the vast castle loomed black upon the hilltop not a spark visible about it the drawbridge was down the great gate stood wide i entered without challenge my own heels making the only sound i heard and it was sepulchral enough in those huge vacant courts chapter xlii war i found clarence alone in his quarters drowned in melancholy and in place of the electric light he had reinstituted the ancient rag lamp and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains drawn tight he sprang up and rushed for me eagerly saying oh its worth a billion milrays to look upon a live person again he knew me as easily as if i hadnt been disguised at all which frightened me one may easily believe that quick now tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster i said how did it come about well if there hadnt been any queen guenever it wouldnt have come so early but it would have come anyway it would have come on your own account by and by by luck it happened to come on the queens and sir launcelots just so give me the details i reckon you will grant that during some years there has been only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking steadily askance at the queen and sir launcelot yes king arthurs and only one heart that was without suspicion yes the kings a heart that isnt capable of thinking evil of a friend well the king might have gone on still happy and unsuspecting to the end of his days but for one of your modern improvements the stock board when you left three miles of the london canterbury and dover were ready for the rails and also ready and ripe for manipulation in the stock market it was wildcat and everybody knew it the stock was for sale at a give away what does sir launcelot do but yes i know he quietly picked up nearly all of it for a song then he bought about twice as much more deliverable upon call and he was about to call when i left very well he did call the boys couldnt deliver oh he had them and he just settled his grip and squeezed them they were laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock to him at and and along there that wasnt worth well when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths they rested up that side by shifting the laugh to the other side that was when they compromised with the invincible at good land he skinned them alive and they deserved it anyway the whole kingdom rejoiced well among the flayed were sir agravaine and sir mordred nephews to the king end of the first act act second scene first an apartment in carlisle castle where the court had gone for a few days hunting persons present the whole tribe of the kings nephews mordred and agravaine propose to call the guileless arthurs attention to guenever and sir launcelot sir gawaine sir gareth and sir gaheris will have nothing to do with it a dispute ensues with loud talk in the midst of it enter the king mordred and agravaine spring their devastating tale upon him tableau a trap is laid for launcelot by the kings command and sir launcelot walks into it he made it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses to wit mordred agravaine and twelve knights of lesser rank for he killed every one of them but mordred but of course that couldnt straighten matters between launcelot and the king and didnt oh dear only one thing could result i see that war and the knights of the realm divided into a kings party and a sir launcelots party yes that was the way of it the king sent the queen to the stake proposing to purify her with fire launcelot and his knights rescued her and in doing it slew certain good old friends of yours and mine in fact some of the best we ever had to wit sir belias le orgulous sir segwarides sir griflet le fils de dieu sir brandiles sir aglovale oh you tear out my heartstrings wait im not done yet sir tor sir gauter sir gillimer the very best man in my subordinate nine what a handy right fielder he was sir reynolds three brothers sir damus sir priamus sir kay the stranger my peerless short stop i ve seen him catch a daisy cutter in his teeth come i cant stand this sir driant sir lambegus sir herminde sir pertilope sir perimones and whom do you think rush go on sir gaheris and sir gareth both oh incredible their love for launcelot was indestructible well it was an accident they were simply onlookers they were unarmed and were merely there to witness the queens punishment sir launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury and he killed these without noticing who they were here is an instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle its for sale on every news stand there the figures nearest the queen are sir launcelot with his sword up and sir gareth gasping his latest breath you can catch the agony in the queens face through the curling smoke its a rattling battle picture indeed it is we must take good care of it its historical value is incalculable go on well the rest of the tale is just war pure and simple launcelot retreated to his town and castle of joyous gard and gathered there a great following of knights the king with a great host went there and there was desperate fighting during several days and as a result all the plain around was paved with corpses and cast iron then the church patched up a peace between arthur and launcelot and the queen and everybody everybody but sir gawaine he was bitter about the slaying of his brothers gareth and gaheris and would not be appeased he notified launcelot to get him thence and make swift preparation and look to be soon attacked so launcelot sailed to his duchy of guienne with his following and gawaine soon followed with an army and he beguiled arthur to go with him arthur left the kingdom in sir mordreds hands until you should return ah a kings customary wisdom yes sir mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship permanent he was going to marry guenever as a first move but she fled and shut herself up in the tower of london mordred attacked the bishop of canterbury dropped down on him with the interdict the king returned mordred fought him at dover at canterbury and again at barham down then there was talk of peace and a composition terms mordred to have cornwall and kent during arthurs life and the whole kingdom afterward well upon my word my dream of a republic to be a dream and so remain yes the two armies lay near salisbury gawaine gawaines head is at dover castle he fell in the fight there gawaine appeared to arthur in a dream at least his ghost did and warned him to refrain from conflict for a month let the delay cost what it might but battle was precipitated by an accident arthur had given order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over the proposed treaty with mordred sound the trumpet and fall on for he had no confidence in mordred mordred had given a similar order to his people well by and by an adder bit a knights heel the knight forgot all about the order and made a slash at the adder with his sword inside of half a minute those two prodigious hosts came together with a crash they butchered away all day then the king however we have started something fresh since you left our paper has no what is that war correspondence why thats good yes the paper was booming right along for the interdict made no impression got no grip while the war lasted i had war correspondents with both armies i will finish that battle by reading you what one of the boys says then the king looked about him and then was he ware of all his host and of all his good knights were left no more on live but two knights that was sir lucan de butlere and his brother sir bedivere and they were full sore wounded jesu mercy said the king where are all my noble knights becomen alas that ever i should see this doleful day for now said arthur i am come to mine end but would to god that i wist where were that traitor sir mordred that hath caused all this mischief then was king arthur ware where sir mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap of dead men now give me my spear said arthur unto sir lucan for yonder i have espied the traitor that all this woe hath wrought sir let him be said sir lucan for he is unhappy and if ye pass this unhappy day ye shall be right well revenged upon him good lord remember ye of your nights dream and what the spirit of sir gawaine told you this night yet god of his great goodness hath preserved you hitherto therefore for gods sake my lord leave off by this for blessed be god ye have won the field for here we be three on live and with sir mordred is none on live and if ye leave off now this wicked day of destiny is past tide me death betide me life saith the king now i see him yonder alone he shall never escape mine hands for at a better avail shall i never have him god speed you well said sir bedivere then the king gat his spear in both his hands and ran toward sir mordred crying traitor now is thy death day come and when sir mordred heard sir arthur he ran until him with his sword drawn in his hand and then king arthur smote sir mordred under the shield with a foin of his spear throughout the body more than a fathom and when sir mordred felt that he had his deaths wound he thrust himself with the might that he had up to the butt of king arthurs spear and right so he smote his father arthur with his sword holden in both his hands on the side of the head that the sword pierced the helmet and the brain pan and therewithal sir mordred fell stark dead to the earth and the noble arthur fell in a swoon to the earth and there he swooned oft times that is a good piece of war correspondence clarence you are a first rate newspaper man well is the king all right did he get well poor soul no he is dead i was utterly stunned it had not seemed to me that any wound could be mortal to him and the queen clarence she is a nun in almesbury what changes and in such a short while it is inconceivable what next i wonder i can tell you what next well stake our lives and stand by them what do you mean by that the church is master now the interdict included you with mordred it is not to be removed while you remain alive the clans are gathering the church has gathered all the knights that are left alive and as soon as you are discovered we shall have business on our hands stuff with our deadly scientific war material with our hosts of trained save your breath we havent sixty faithful left what are you saying our schools our colleges our vast workshops our when those knights come those establishments will empty themselves and go over to the enemy did you think you had educated the superstition out of those people i certainly did think it well then you may unthink it they stood every strain easily until the interdict since then they merely put on a bold outside at heart they are quaking make up your mind to it when the armies come the mask will fall its hard news we are lost they will turn our own science against us no they wont why because i and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game i ll tell you what i ve done and what moved me to it smart as you are the church was smarter it was the church that sent you cruising through her servants the doctors clarence it is the truth i know it every officer of your ship was the churchs picked servant and so was every man of the crew oh come it is just as i tell you i did not find out these things at once but i found them out finally did you send me verbal information by the commander of the ship to the effect that upon his return to you with supplies you were going to leave cadiz cadiz i havent been at cadiz at all going to leave cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely for the health of your family did you send me that word of course not i would have written wouldnt i naturally i was troubled and suspicious when the commander sailed again i managed to ship a spy with him i have never heard of vessel or spy since i gave myself two weeks to hear from you in then i resolved to send a ship to cadiz there was a reason why i didnt what was that our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared also as suddenly and as mysteriously the railway and telegraph and telephone service ceased the men all deserted poles were cut down the church laid a ban upon the electric light i had to be up and doing and straight off your life was safe nobody in these kingdoms but merlin would venture to touch such a magician as you without ten thousand men at his back i had nothing to think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your coming i felt safe myself nobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours so this is what i did from our various works i selected all the men boys i mean whose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure i could swear to and i called them together secretly and gave them their instructions there are fifty two of them none younger than fourteen and none above seventeen years old why did you select boys because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition and reared in it it is in their blood and bones we imagined we had educated it out of them they thought so too the interdict woke them up like a thunderclap it revealed them to themselves and it revealed them to me too with boys it was different such as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had no acquaintance with the churchs terrors and it was among these that i found my fifty two as a next move i paid a private visit to that old cave of merlins not the small one the big one yes the one where we secretly established our first great electric plant when i was projecting a miracle just so and as that miracle hadnt become necessary then i thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now i ve provisioned the cave for a siege a good idea a first rate idea i think so i placed four of my boys there as a guard inside and out of sight nobody was to be hurt while outside but any attempt to enter well we said just let anybody try it then i went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite deposits under all our vast factories mills workshops magazines etc and about midnight i and my boys turned out and connected that wire with the cave and nobody but you and i suspects where the other end of it goes to we laid it under ground of course and it was all finished in a couple of hours or so we shan t have to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization it was the right move and the natural one military necessity in the changed condition of things well what changes have come we expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other but however go on next we built a wire fence wire fence yes you dropped the hint of it yourself two or three years ago oh i remember the time the church tried her strength against us the first time and presently thought it wise to wait for a hopefuler season well how have you arranged the fence i start twelve immensely strong wires naked not insulated from a big dynamo in the cave dynamo with no brushes except a positive and a negative one yes thats right the wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level ground a hundred yards in diameter they make twelve independent fences ten feet apart that is to say twelve circles within circles and their ends come into the cave again right go on the fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground that is good and strong yes the wires have no ground connection outside of the cave they go out from the positive brush of the dynamo there is a ground connection through the negative brush the other ends of the wire return to the cave and each is grounded independently no no that wont do why its too expensive uses up force for nothing you dont want any ground connection except the one through the negative brush the other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave and fastened independently and without any ground connection now then observe the economy of it a cavalry charge hurls itself against the fence you are using no power you are spending no money for there is only one ground connection till those horses come against the wire the moment they touch it they form a connection with the negative brush through the ground and drop dead dont you see you are using no energy until it is needed your lightning is there and ready like the load in a gun but it isnt costing you a cent till you touch it off oh yes the single ground connection of course i dont know how i overlooked that its not only cheaper but its more effectual than the other way for if wires break or get tangled no harm is done no especially if we have a tell tale in the cave and disconnect the broken wire well go on the gatlings yes thats arranged in the center of the inner circle on a spacious platform six feet high i ve grouped a battery of thirteen gatling guns and provided plenty of ammunition thats it they command every approach and when the churchs knights arrive theres going to be music the brow of the precipice over the cave i ve got a wire fence there and a gatling they wont drop any rocks down on us well and the glass cylinder dynamite torpedoes thats attended to its the prettiest garden that was ever planted its a belt forty feet wide and goes around the outer fence distance between it and the fence one hundred yards kind of neutral ground that space is there isnt a single square yard of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo we laid them on the surface of the ground and sprinkled a layer of sand over them its an innocent looking garden but you let a man start in to hoe it once and you ll see you tested the torpedoes well i was going to but but what why its an immense oversight not to apply a test yes i know but they re all right i laid a few in the public road beyond our lines and they ve been tested oh that alters the case who did it a church committee how kind yes they came to command us to make submission you see they didnt really come to test the torpedoes that was merely an incident did the committee make a report yes they made one you could have heard it a mile unanimous that was the nature of it after that i put up some signs for the protection of future committees and we have had no intruders since clarence you ve done a world of work and done it perfectly we had plenty of time for it there wasnt any occasion for hurry we sat silent awhile thinking then my mind was made up and i said yes everything is ready everything is shipshape no detail is wanting i know what to do now so do i sit down and wait no sir rise up and strike do you mean it yes indeed the de fensive isnt in my line and the of fensive is that is when i hold a fair hand two thirds as good a hand as the enemy oh yes we ll rise up and strike thats our game a hundred to one you are right when does the performance begin now we ll proclaim the republic well that will precipitate things sure enough it will make them buzz i tell you england will be a hornets nest before noon to morrow if the churchs hand hasnt lost its cunning and we know it hasnt now you write and i ll dictate thus proclamation be it known unto all whereas the king having died and left no heir it becomes my duty to continue the executive authority vested in me until a government shall have been created and set in motion the monarchy has lapsed it no longer exists by consequence all political power has reverted to its original source the people of the nation with the monarchy its several adjuncts died also wherefore there is no longer a nobility no longer a privileged class no longer an established church all men are become exactly equal they are upon one common level and religion is free a republic is hereby proclaimed as being the natural estate of a nation when other authority has ceased it is the duty of the british people to meet together immediately and by their votes elect representatives and deliver into their hands the government i signed it the boss and dated it from merlins cave clarence said why that tells where we are and invites them to call right away that is the idea we strike by the proclamation then its their innings now have the thing set up and printed and posted right off that is give the order then if you ve got a couple of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill ho for merlins cave i shall be ready in ten minutes what a cyclone there is going to be to morrow when this piece of paper gets to work its a pleasant old palace this is i wonder if we shall ever again but never mind about that chapter xliii the battle of the sand belt in merlins cave clarence and i and fifty two fresh bright well educated clean minded young british boys at dawn i sent an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop operations and remove all life to a safe distance as everything was going to be blown up by secret mines and no telling at what moment therefore vacate at once these people knew me and had confidence in my word they would clear out without waiting to part their hair and i could take my own time about dating the explosion you couldnt hire one of them to go back during the century if the explosion was still impending we had a week of waiting it was not dull for me because i was writing all the time during the first three days i finished turning my old diary into this narrative form it only required a chapter or so to bring it down to date the rest of the week i took up in writing letters to my wife it was always my habit to write to sandy every day whenever we were separate and now i kept up the habit for love of it and of her though i couldnt do anything with the letters of course after i had written them but it put in the time you see and was almost like talking it was almost as if i was saying sandy if you and hello central were here in the cave instead of only your photographs what good times we could have and then you know i could imagine the baby goo gooing something out in reply with its fists in its mouth and itself stretched across its mothers lap on its back and she a laughing and admiring and worshipping and now and then tickling under the babys chin to set it cackling and then maybe throwing in a word of answer to me herself and so on and so on well dont you know i could sit there in the cave with my pen and keep it up that way by the hour with them why it was almost like having us all together again i had spies out every night of course to get news every report made things look more and more impressive the hosts were gathering gathering down all the roads and paths of england the knights were riding and priests rode with them to hearten these original crusaders this being the churchs war all the nobilities big and little were on their way and all the gentry this was all as was expected we should thin out this sort of folk to such a degree that the people would have nothing to do but just step to the front with their republic and ah what a donkey i was toward the end of the week i began to get this large and disenchanting fact through my head that the mass of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for about one day and there an end the church the nobles and the gentry then turned one grand all disapproving frown upon them and shriveled them into sheep from that moment the sheep had begun to gather to the fold that is to say the camps and offer their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the righteous cause why even the very men who had lately been slaves were in the righteous cause and glorifying it praying for it sentimentally slabbering over it just like all the other commoners imagine such human muck as this conceive of this folly yes it was now death to the republic everywhere not a dissenting voice all england was marching against us truly this was more than i had bargained for i watched my fifty two boys narrowly watched their faces their walk their unconscious attitudes for all these are a language a language given us purposely that it may betray us in times of emergency when we have secrets which we want to keep i knew that that thought would keep saying itself over and over again in their minds and hearts all england is marching against us and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations until even in their sleep they would find no rest from it but hear the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say all england all england is marching against you i knew all this would happen i knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great that it would compel utterance therefore i must be ready with an answer at that time an answer well chosen and tranquilizing i was right the time came they had to speak poor lads it was pitiful to see they were so pale so worn so troubled at first their spokesman could hardly find voice or words but he presently got both this is what he said and he put it in the neat modern english taught him in my schools we have tried to forget what we are english boys we have tried to put reason before sentiment duty before love our minds approve but our hearts reproach us while apparently it was only the nobility only the gentry only the twenty five or thirty thousand knights left alive out of the late wars we were of one mind and undisturbed by any troubling doubt each and every one of these fifty two lads who stand here before you said they have chosen it is their affair but think the matter is altered all england is marching against us oh sir consider reflect these people are our people they are bone of our bone flesh of our flesh we love them do not ask us to destroy our nation well it shows the value of looking ahead and being ready for a thing when it happens if i hadnt foreseen this thing and been fixed that boy would have had me i couldnt have said a word but i was fixed i said my boys your hearts are in the right place you have thought the worthy thought you have done the worthy thing you are english boys you will remain english boys and you will keep that name unsmirched give yourselves no further concern let your minds be at peace consider this while all england is marching against us who is in the van who by the commonest rules of war will march in the front answer me the mounted host of mailed knights true they are thirty thousand strong acres deep they will march now observe none but they will ever strike the sand belt then there will be an episode immediately after the civilian multitude in the rear will retire to meet business engagements elsewhere none but nobles and gentry are knights and none but these will remain to dance to our music after that episode it is absolutely true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand knights now speak and it shall be as you decide shall we avoid the battle retire from the field no the shout was unanimous and hearty are you are you well afraid of these thirty thousand knights that joke brought out a good laugh the boys troubles vanished away and they went gaily to their posts ah they were a darling fifty two as pretty as girls too i was ready for the enemy now let the approaching big day come along it would find us on deck the big day arrived on time at dawn the sentry on watch in the corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under the horizon and a faint sound which he thought to be military music breakfast was just ready we sat down and ate it this over i made the boys a little speech and then sent out a detail to man the battery with clarence in command of it the sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over the land and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea nearer and nearer it came and more and more sublimely imposing became its aspect yes all england was there apparently soon we could see the innumerable banners fluttering and then the sun struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash yes it was a fine sight i hadnt ever seen anything to beat it at last we could make out details all the front ranks no telling how many acres deep were horsemen plumed knights in armor suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets the slow walk burst into a gallop and then well it was wonderful to see down swept that vast horse shoe wave it approached the sand belt my breath stood still nearer nearer the strip of green turf beyond the yellow belt grew narrow narrower still became a mere ribbon in front of the horses then disappeared under their hoofs great scott why the whole front of that host shot into the sky with a thunder crash and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was left of the multitude from our sight time for the second step in the plan of campaign i touched a button and shook the bones of england loose from her spine in that explosion all our noble civilization factories went up in the air and disappeared from the earth it was a pity but it was necessary we could not afford to let the enemy turn our own weapons against us now ensued one of the dullest quarter hours i had ever endured we waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these we couldnt see over the wall of smoke and we couldnt see through it but at last it began to shred away lazily and by the end of another quarter hour the land was clear and our curiosity was enabled to satisfy itself no living creature was in sight we now perceived that additions had been made to our defenses the dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet wide all around us and cast up an embankment some twenty five feet high on both borders of it as to destruction of life it was amazing moreover it was beyond estimate of course we could not count the dead because they did not exist as individuals but merely as homogeneous protoplasm with alloys of iron and buttons no life was in sight but necessarily there must have been some wounded in the rear ranks who were carried off the field under cover of the wall of smoke there would be sickness among the others there always is after an episode like that but there would be no reinforcements this was the last stand of the chivalry of england it was all that was left of the order after the recent annihilating wars so i felt quite safe in believing that the utmost force that could for the future be brought against us would be but small that is of knights i therefore issued a congratulatory proclamation to my army in these words soldiers champions of human liberty and equality your general congratulates you in the pride of his strength and the vanity of his renown an arrogant enemy came against you you were ready the conflict was brief on your side glorious this mighty victory having been achieved utterly without loss stands without example in history so long as the planets shall continue to move in their orbits the battle of the sand belt will not perish out of the memories of men the boss i read it well and the applause i got was very gratifying to me i then wound up with these remarks the war with the english nation as a nation is at an end the nation has retired from the field and the war before it can be persuaded to return war will have ceased this campaign is the only one that is going to be fought it will be brief the briefest in history also the most destructive to life considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to numbers engaged we are done with the nation henceforth we deal only with the knights english knights can be killed but they cannot be conquered we know what is before us while one of these men remains alive our task is not finished the war is not ended we will kill them all loud and long continued applause i picketed the great embankments thrown up around our lines by the dynamite explosion merely a lookout of a couple of boys to announce the enemy when he should appear again next i sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond our lines on the south to turn a mountain brook that was there and bring it within our lines and under our command arranging it in such a way that i could make instant use of it in an emergency the forty men were divided into two shifts of twenty each and were to relieve each other every two hours in ten hours the work was accomplished it was nightfall now and i withdrew my pickets the one who had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight but visible with the glass only he also reported that a few knights had been feeling their way toward us and had driven some cattle across our lines but that the knights themselves had not come very near that was what i had been expecting they were feeling us you see they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror on them again they would grow bolder in the night perhaps i believed i knew what project they would attempt because it was plainly the thing i would attempt myself if i were in their places and as ignorant as they were i mentioned it to clarence i think you are right said he it is the obvious thing for them to try well then i said if they do it they are doomed certainly they wont have the slightest show in the world of course they wont its dreadful clarence it seems an awful pity the thing disturbed me so that i couldnt get any peace of mind for thinking of it and worrying over it so at last to quiet my conscience i framed this message to the knights to the honorable the commander of the insurgent chivalry of england you fight in vain we know your strength if one may call it by that name we know that at the utmost you cannot bring against us above five and twenty thousand knights therefore you have no chance none whatever reflect we are well equipped well fortified we number fifty four what men no minds the capablest in the world a force against which mere animal might may no more hope to prevail than may the idle waves of the sea hope to prevail against the granite barriers of england be advised we offer you your lives for the sake of your families do not reject the gift we offer you this chance and it is the last throw down your arms surrender unconditionally to the republic and all will be forgiven signed the boss i read it to clarence and said i proposed to send it by a flag of truce he laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with and said somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what these nobilities are now let us save a little time and trouble consider me the commander of the knights yonder now then you are the flag of truce approach and deliver me your message and i will give you your answer i humored the idea i came forward under an imaginary guard of the enemys soldiers produced my paper and read it through for answer clarence struck the paper out of my hand pursed up a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain dismember me this animal and return him in a basket to the base born knave who sent him other answer have i none how empty is theory in presence of fact and this was just fact and nothing else it was the thing that would have happened there was no getting around that i tore up the paper and granted my mistimed sentimentalities a permanent rest then to business i tested the electric signals from the gatling platform to the cave and made sure that they were all right i tested and retested those which commanded the fences these were signals whereby i could break and renew the electric current in each fence independently of the others at will i placed the brook connection under the guard and authority of three of my best boys who would alternate in two hour watches all night and promptly obey my signal if i should have occasion to give it three revolver shots in quick succession sentry duty was discarded for the night and the corral left empty of life i ordered that quiet be maintained in the cave and the electric lights turned down to a glimmer as soon as it was good and dark i shut off the current from all the fences and then groped my way out to the embankment bordering our side of the great dynamite ditch i crept to the top of it and lay there on the slant of the muck to watch but it was too dark to see anything as for sounds there were none the stillness was deathlike true there were the usual night sounds of the country the whir of night birds the buzzing of insects the barking of distant dogs the mellow lowing of far off kine but these didnt seem to break the stillness they only intensified it and added a grewsome melancholy to it into the bargain i presently gave up looking the night shut down so black but i kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound for i judged i had only to wait and i shouldnt be disappointed however i had to wait a long time at last i caught what you may call in distinct glimpses of sound dulled metallic sound i pricked up my ears then and held my breath for this was the sort of thing i had been waiting for this sound thickened and approached from toward the north presently i heard it at my own level the ridge top of the opposite embankment a hundred feet or more away then i seemed to see a row of black dots appear along that ridge human heads i couldnt tell it mightnt be anything at all you cant depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus however the question was soon settled i heard that metallic noise descending into the great ditch it augmented fast it spread all along and it unmistakably furnished me this fact an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch yes these people were arranging a little surprise party for us we could expect entertainment about dawn possibly earlier i groped my way back to the corral now i had seen enough i went to the platform and signaled to turn the current on to the two inner fences then i went into the cave and found everything satisfactory there nobody awake but the working watch i woke clarence and told him the great ditch was filling up with men and that i believed all the knights were coming for us in a body it was my notion that as soon as dawn approached we could expect the ditchs ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankment and make an assault and be followed immediately by the rest of their army clarence said they will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make preliminary observations why not take the lightning off the outer fences and give them a chance i ve already done it clarence did you ever know me to be inhospitable no you are a good heart i want to go and be a reception committee i will go too we crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside fences even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight somewhat but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and soon it was adjusted for present circumstances we had had to feel our way before but we could make out to see the fence posts now we started a whispered conversation but suddenly clarence broke off and said what is that what is what that thing yonder what thing where there beyond you a little piece dark something a dull shape of some kind against the second fence i gazed and he gazed i said could it be a man clarence no i think not if you notice it looks a lit why it is a man leaning on the fence i certainly believe it is let us go and see we crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close and then looked up yes it was a man a dim great figure in armor standing erect with both hands on the upper wire and of course there was a smell of burning flesh poor fellow dead as a door nail and never knew what hurt him he stood there like a statue no motion about him except that his plumes swished about a little in the night wind we rose up and looked in through the bars of his visor but couldnt make out whether we knew him or not features too dim and shadowed we heard muffled sounds approaching and we sank down to the ground where we were we made out another knight vaguely he was coming very stealthily and feeling his way he was near enough now for us to see him put out a hand find an upper wire then bend and step under it and over the lower one now he arrived at the first knight and started slightly when he discovered him he stood a moment no doubt wondering why the other one didnt move on then he said in a low voice why dreamest thou here good sir mar then he laid his hand on the corpses shoulder and just uttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead killed by a dead man you see killed by a dead friend in fact there was something awful about it these early birds came scattering along after each other about one every five minutes in our vicinity during half an hour they brought no armor of offense but their swords as a rule they carried the sword ready in the hand and put it forward and found the wires with it we would now and then see a blue spark when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible to us but we knew what had happened all the same poor fellow he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been electrocuted we had brief intervals of grim stillness interrupted with piteous regularity by the clash made by the falling of an iron clad and this sort of thing was going on right along and was very creepy there in the dark and lonesomeness we concluded to make a tour between the inner fences we elected to walk upright for conveniences sake we argued that if discerned we should be taken for friends rather than enemies and in any case we should be out of reach of swords and these gentry did not seem to have any spears along well it was a curious trip everywhere dead men were lying outside the second fence not plainly visible but still visible and we counted fifteen of those pathetic statues dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire one thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated our current was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound and next moment we guessed what it was it was a surprise in force coming i whispered clarence to go and wake the army and notify it to wait in silence in the cave for further orders he was soon back and we stood by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful work upon that swarming host one could make out but little of detail but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up beyond the second fence that swelling bulk was dead men our camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead a bulwark a breastwork of corpses you may say one terrible thing about this thing was the absence of human voices there were no cheers no war cries being intent upon a surprise these men moved as noiselessly as they could and always when the front rank was near enough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to get a shout ready of course they struck the fatal line and went down without testifying i sent a current through the third fence now and almost immediately through the fourth and fifth so quickly were the gaps filled up i believed the time was come now for my climax i believed that that whole army was in our trap anyway it was high time to find out so i touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame on the top of our precipice land what a sight we were enclosed in three walls of dead men all the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires the sudden glare paralyzed this host petrified them you may say with astonishment there was just one instant for me to utilize their immobility in and i didnt lose the chance you see in another instant they would have recovered their faculties then theyd have burst into a cheer and made a rush and my wires would have gone down before it but that lost instant lost them their opportunity forever while even that slight fragment of time was still unspent i shot the current through all the fences and struck the whole host dead in their tracks there was a groan you could hear it voiced the death pang of eleven thousand men it swelled out on the night with awful pathos a glance showed that the rest of the enemy perhaps ten thousand strong were between us and the encircling ditch and pressing forward to the assault consequently we had them all and had them past help time for the last act of the tragedy i fired the three appointed revolver shots which meant turn on the water there was a sudden rush and roar and in a minute the mountain brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a hundred feet wide and twenty five deep stand to your guns men open fire the thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten thousand they halted they stood their ground a moment against that withering deluge of fire then they broke faced about and swept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale a full fourth part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment the three fourths reached it and plunged over to death by drowning within ten short minutes after we had opened fire armed resistance was totally annihilated the campaign was ended we fifty four were masters of england twenty five thousand men lay dead around us but how treacherous is fortune in a little while say an hour happened a thing by my own fault which but i have no heart to write that let the record end here chapter xliv a postscript by clarence i clarence must write it for him he proposed that we two go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded i was strenuous against the project i said that if there were many we could do but little for them and it would not be wise for us to trust ourselves among them anyway but he could seldom be turned from a purpose once formed so we shut off the electric current from the fences took an escort along climbed over the enclosing ramparts of dead knights and moved out upon the field the first wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back against a dead comrade when the boss bent over him and spoke to him the man recognized him and stabbed him that knight was sir meliagraunce as i found out by tearing off his helmet he will not ask for help any more we carried the boss to the cave and gave his wound which was not very serious the best care we could in this service we had the help of merlin though we did not know it he was disguised as a woman and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife in this disguise with brown stained face and smooth shaven he had appeared a few days after the boss was hurt and offered to cook for us saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps which the enemy were forming and that she was starving the boss had been getting along very well and had amused himself with finishing up his record we were glad to have this woman for we were short handed we were in a trap you see a trap of our own making if we stayed where we were our dead would kill us if we moved out of our defenses we should no longer be invincible we had conquered in turn we were conquered the boss recognized this we all recognized it if we could go to one of those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemy yes but the boss could not go and neither could i for i was among the first that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands others were taken down and still others to morrow to morrow it is here and with it the end about midnight i awoke and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about the bosss head and face and wondered what it meant everybody but the dynamo watch lay steeped in sleep there was no sound the woman ceased from her mysterious foolery and started tip toeing toward the door i called out stop what have you been doing she halted and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction ye were conquerors ye are conquered these others are perishing you also ye shall all die in this place every one except him he sleepeth now and shall sleep thirteen centuries i am merlin then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled about like a drunken man and presently fetched up against one of our wires his mouth is spread open yet apparently he is still laughing i suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until the corpse turns to dust the boss has never stirred sleeps like a stone if he does not wake to day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is and his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses of the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it as for the rest of us well it is agreed that if any one of us ever escapes alive from this place he will write the fact here and loyally hide this manuscript with the boss our dear good chief whose property it is be he alive or dead adventures of huckleberry finn chapter i you dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer but that aint no matter that book was made by mr mark twain and he told the truth mainly there was things which he stretched but mainly he told the truth that is nothing i never seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was aunt polly or the widow or maybe mary aunt polly toms aunt polly she is and mary and the widow douglas is all told about in that book which is mostly a true book with some stretchers as i said before now the way that the book winds up is this tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich we got six thousand dollars apiece all gold it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up well judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round more than a body could tell what to do with the widow douglas she took me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways and so when i couldnt stand it no longer i lit out i got into my old rags and my sugar hogshead again and was free and satisfied but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable so i went back the widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and she called me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm by it she put me in them new clothes again and i couldnt do nothing but sweat and sweat and feel all cramped up well then the old thing commenced again the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time when you got to the table you couldnt go right to eating but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals though there warnt really anything the matter with them that is nothing only everything was cooked by itself in a barrel of odds and ends it is different things get mixed up and the juice kind of swaps around and the things go better after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the bulrushers and i was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time so then i didnt care no more about him because i dont take no stock in dead people pretty soon i wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me but she wouldnt she said it was a mean practice and wasnt clean and i must try to not do it any more that is just the way with some people they get down on a thing when they dont know nothing about it here she was a bothering about moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybody being gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it and she took snuff too of course that was all right because she done it herself her sister miss watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles on had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a spelling book she worked me middling hard for about an hour and then the widow made her ease up i couldnt stood it much longer then for an hour it was deadly dull and i was fidgety miss watson would say dont put your feet up there huckleberry and dont scrunch up like that huckleberry set up straight and pretty soon she would say dont gap and stretch like that huckleberry why dont you try to behave then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wished i was there she got mad then but i didnt mean no harm all i wanted was to go somewheres all i wanted was a change i warnt particular she said it was wicked to say what i said said she wouldnt say it for the whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place well i couldnt see no advantage in going where she was going so i made up my mind i wouldnt try for it but i never said so because it would only make trouble and wouldnt do no good now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good place she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing forever and ever so i didnt think much of it but i never said so i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer would go there and she said not by a considerable sight i was glad about that because i wanted him and me to be together miss watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome by and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers and then everybody was off to bed i went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it on the table then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful but it warnt no use i felt so lonesome i most wished i was dead the stars were shining and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful and i heard an owl away off who whooing about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die and the wind was trying to whisper something to me and i couldnt make out what it was and so it made the cold shivers run over me then away out in the woods i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something thats on its mind and cant make itself understood and so cant rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving i got so down hearted and scared i did wish i had some company pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder and i flipped it off and it lit in the candle and before i could budge it was all shriveled up i didnt need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away but i hadnt no confidence you do that when you ve lost a horseshoe that you ve found instead of nailing it up over the door but i hadnt ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when youd killed a spider i set down again a shaking all over and got out my pipe for a smoke for the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldnt know well after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boom boom boom twelve licks and all still again stiller than ever pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees something was a stirring i set still and listened directly i could just barely hear a me yow me yow down there that was good says i me yow me yow as soft as i could and then i put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed then i slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees and sure enough there was tom sawyer waiting for me chapter ii we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widows garden stooping down so as the branches wouldnt scrape our heads when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a noise we scrouched down and laid still miss watsons big nigger named jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him pretty clear because there was a light behind him he got up and stretched his neck out about a minute listening then he says who dah he listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us we could a touched him nearly well likely it was minutes and minutes that there warnt a sound and we all there so close together there was a place on my ankle that got to itching but i dasnt scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right between my shoulders seemed like id die if i couldnt scratch well i ve noticed that thing plenty times since if you are with the quality or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you aint sleepy if you are anywheres where it wont do for you to scratch why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places pretty soon jim says say who is you whar is you dog my cats ef i didn hear sumfn well i know what is gwyne to do is gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom he leaned his back up against a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine my nose begun to itch it itched till the tears come into my eyes but i dasnt scratch then it begun to itch on the inside next i got to itching underneath i didnt know how i was going to set still this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes but it seemed a sight longer than that i was itching in eleven different places now i reckoned i couldnt stand it moren a minute longer but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try just then jim begun to breathe heavy next he begun to snore and then i was pretty soon comfortable again tom he made a sign to me kind of a little noise with his mouth and we went creeping away on our hands and knees when we was ten foot off tom whispered to me and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun but i said no he might wake and make a disturbance and then theyd find out i warnt in then tom said he hadnt got candles enough and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more i didnt want him to try i said jim might wake up and come but tom wanted to resk it so we slid in there and got three candles and tom laid five cents on the table for pay then we got out and i was in a sweat to get away but nothing would do tom but he must crawl to where jim was on his hands and knees and play something on him i waited and it seemed a good while everything was so still and lonesome as soon as tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fence and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house tom said he slipped jims hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him and jim stirred a little but he didnt wake afterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance and rode him all over the state and then set him under the trees again and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it and next time jim told it he said they rode him down to new orleans and after that every time he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode him all over the world and tired him most to death and his back was all over saddle boils jim was monstrous proud about it and he got so he wouldnt hardly notice the other niggers niggers would come miles to hear jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over same as if he was a wonder niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things jim would happen in and say hm what you know bout witches and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat jim always kept that five center piece round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it but he never told what it was he said to it niggers would come from all around there and give jim anything they had just for a sight of that five center piece but they wouldnt touch it because the devil had had his hands on it jim was most ruined for a servant because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches well when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling where there was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad and awful still and grand we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard so we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half to the big scar on the hillside and went ashore we went to a clump of bushes and tom made everybody swear to keep the secret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickest part of the bushes then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands and knees we went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldnt a noticed that there was a hole we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold and there we stopped tom says now we ll start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyers gang everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name in blood everybody was willing so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on and read it it swore every boy to stick to the band and never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it and he mustnt eat and he mustnt sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the sign of the band and nobody that didnt belong to the band could use that mark and if he did he must be sued and if he done it again he must be killed and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets he must have his throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever everybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked tom if he got it out of his own head he said some of it but the rest was out of pirate books and robber books and every gang that was high toned had it some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it in then ben rogers says heres huck finn he haint got no family what you going to do bout him well haint he got a father says tom sawyer yes hes got a father but you cant never find him these days he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he haint been seen in these parts for a year or more they talked it over and they was going to rule me out because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else it wouldnt be fair and square for the others well nobody could think of anything to do everybody was stumped and set still i was most ready to cry but all at once i thought of a way and so i offered them miss watson they could kill her everybody said oh she ll do thats all right huck can come in then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with and i made my mark on the paper now says ben rogers whats the line of business of this gang nothing only robbery and murder tom said but who are we going to rob houses or cattle or stuff stealing cattle and such things aint robbery its burglary says tom sawyer we aint burglars that aint no sort of style we are highwaymen we stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on and kill the people and take their watches and money must we always kill the people oh certainly its best some authorities think different but mostly its considered best to kill them except some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till they re ransomed ransomed whats that i dont know but thats what they do i ve seen it in books and so of course thats what we ve got to do but how can we do it if we dont know what it is why blame it all we ve got to do it dont i tell you its in the books do you want to go to doing different from whats in the books and get things all muddled up oh thats all very fine to say tom sawyer but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we dont know how to do it to them thats the thing i want to get at now what do you reckon it is well i dont know but per aps if we keep them till they re ransomed it means that we keep them till they re dead now thats something like that ll answer why couldnt you said that before we ll keep them till they re ransomed to death and a bothersome lot they ll be too eating up everything and always trying to get loose how you talk ben rogers how can they get loose when theres a guard over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg a guard well that is good so somebodys got to set up all night and never get any sleep just so as to watch them i think thats foolishness why cant a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here because it aint in the books so thats why now ben rogers do you want to do things regular or dont you thats the idea dont you reckon that the people that made the books knows whats the correct thing to do do you reckon you can learn em anything not by a good deal no sir we ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way all right i dont mind but i say its a fool way anyhow say do we kill the women too well ben rogers if i was as ignorant as you i wouldnt let on kill the women no nobody ever saw anything in the books like that you fetch them to the cave and you re always as polite as pie to them and by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any more well if thats the way im agreed but i dont take no stock in it mighty soon we ll have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellows waiting to be ransomed that there wont be no place for the robbers but go ahead i aint got nothing to say little tommy barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he was scared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didnt want to be a robber any more so they all made fun of him and called him cry baby and that made him mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets but tom give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebody and kill some people ben rogers said he couldnt get out much only sundays and so he wanted to begin next sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on sunday and that settled the thing they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so started home i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking my new clothes was all greased up and clayey and i was dog tired chapter iii well i got a good going over in the morning from old miss watson on account of my clothes but the widow she didnt scold but only cleaned off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that i thought i would behave awhile if i could then miss watson she took me in the closet and prayed but nothing come of it she told me to pray every day and whatever i asked for i would get it but it warnt so i tried it once i got a fish line but no hooks it warnt any good to me without hooks i tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow i couldnt make it work by and by one day i asked miss watson to try for me but she said i was a fool she never told me why and i couldnt make it out no way i set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it i says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why dont deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork why cant the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole why cant miss watson fat up no says i to my self there aint nothing in it i went and told the widow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts this was too many for me but she told me what she meant i must help other people and do everything i could for other people and look out for them all the time and never think about myself this was including miss watson as i took it i went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time but i couldnt see no advantage about it except for the other people so at last i reckoned i wouldnt worry about it any more but just let it go sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a bodys mouth water but maybe next day miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again i judged i could see that there was two providences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widows providence but if miss watsons got him there warnt no help for him any more i thought it all out and reckoned i would belong to the widows if he wanted me though i couldnt make out how he was a going to be any better off then than what he was before seeing i was so ignorant and so kind of low down and ornery pap he hadnt been seen for more than a year and that was comfortable for me i didnt want to see him no more he used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me though i used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around well about this time he was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town so people said they judged it was him anyway said this drownded man was just his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was all like pap but they couldnt make nothing out of the face because it had been in the water so long it warnt much like a face at all they said he was floating on his back in the water they took him and buried him on the bank but i warnt comfortable long because i happened to think of something i knowed mighty well that a drownded man dont float on his back but on his face so i knowed then that this warnt pap but a woman dressed up in a mans clothes so i was uncomfortable again i judged the old man would turn up again by and by though i wished he wouldnt we played robber now and then about a month and then i resigned all the boys did we hadnt robbed nobody hadnt killed any people but only just pretended we used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market but we never hived any of them tom sawyer called the hogs ingots and he called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and marked but i couldnt see no profit in it one time tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick which he called a slogan which was the sign for the gang to get together and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchants and rich a rabs was going to camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter mules all loaded down with di monds and they didnt have only a guard of four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he called it and kill the lot and scoop the things he said we must slick up our swords and guns and get ready he never could go after even a turnip cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it though they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at them till you rotted and then they warnt worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before i didnt believe we could lick such a crowd of spaniards and a rabs but i wanted to see the camels and elephants so i was on hand next day saturday in the ambuscade and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill but there warnt no spaniards and a rabs and there warnt no camels nor no elephants it warnt anything but a sunday school picnic and only a primer class at that we busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam though ben rogers got a rag doll and jo harper got a hymn book and a tract and then the teacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut i didnt see no di monds and i told tom sawyer so he said there was loads of them there anyway and he said there was a rabs there too and elephants and things i said why couldnt we see them then he said if i warnt so ignorant but had read a book called don quixote i would know without asking he said it was all done by enchantment he said there was hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the whole thing into an infant sunday school just out of spite i said all right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians tom sawyer said i was a numskull why said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church well i sayss pose we got some genies to help us cant we lick the other crowd then how you going to get them i dont know how do they get them why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come tearing in with the thunder and lightning a ripping around and the smoke a rolling and everything they re told to do they up and do it they dont think nothing of pulling a shot tower up by the roots and belting a sunday school superintendent over the head with it or any other man who makes them tear around so why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring and they ve got to do whatever he says if he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di monds and fill it full of chewing gum or whatever you want and fetch an emperors daughter from china for you to marry they ve got to do it and they ve got to do it before sun up next morning too and more they ve got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand well says i i think they are a pack of flat heads for not keeping the palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that and whats more if i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp how you talk huck finn why youd have to come when he rubbed it whether you wanted to or not what and i as high as a tree and as big as a church all right then i would come but i lay id make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country shucks it aint no use to talk to you huck finn you dont seem to know anything somehow perfect saphead i thought all this over for two or three days and then i reckoned i would see if there was anything in it i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like an injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warnt no use none of the genies come so then i judged that all that stuff was only just one of tom sawyers lies i reckoned he believed in the a rabs and the elephants but as for me i think different it had all the marks of a sunday school chapter iv well three or four months run along and it was well into the winter now i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty five and i dont reckon i could ever get any further than that if i was to live forever i dont take no stock in mathematics anyway at first i hated the school but by and by i got so i could stand it whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey and the hiding i got next day done me good and cheered me up so the longer i went to school the easier it got to be i was getting sort of used to the widows ways too and they warnt so raspy on me living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather i used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was a rest to me i liked the old ways best but i was getting so i liked the new ones too a little bit the widow said i was coming along slow but sure and doing very satisfactory she said she warnt ashamed of me one morning i happened to turn over the salt cellar at breakfast i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck but miss watson was in ahead of me and crossed me off she says take your hands away huckleberry what a mess you are always making the widow put in a good word for me but that warnt going to keep off the bad luck i knowed that well enough i started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky and wondering where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be there is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasnt one of them kind so i never tried to do anything but just poked along low spirited and on the watch out i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence there was an inch of new snow on the ground and i seen somebodys tracks they had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden fence it was funny they hadnt come in after standing around so i couldnt make it out it was very curious somehow i was going to follow around but i stooped down to look at the tracks first i didnt notice anything at first but next i did there was a cross in the left boot heel made with big nails to keep off the devil i was up in a second and shinning down the hill i looked over my shoulder every now and then but i didnt see nobody i was at judge thatchers as quick as i could get there he said why my boy you are all out of breath did you come for your interest no sir i says is there some for me oh yes a half yearly is in last night over a hundred and fifty dollars quite a fortune for you you had better let me invest it along with your six thousand because if you take it you ll spend it no sir i says i dont want to spend it i dont want it at all nor the six thousand nuther i want you to take it i want to give it to you the six thousand and all he looked surprised he couldnt seem to make it out he says why what can you mean my boy i says dont you ask me no questions about it please you ll take it wont you he says well im puzzled is something the matter please take it says i and dont ask me nothing then i wont have to tell no lies he studied a while and then he says oho o i think i see you want to sell all your property to me not give it thats the correct idea then he wrote something on a paper and read it over and says there you see it says for a consideration that means i have bought it of you and paid you for it heres a dollar for you now you sign it so i signed it and left miss watsons nigger jim had a hair ball as big as your fist which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to do magic with it he said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowed everything so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again for i found his tracks in the snow what i wanted to know was what he was going to do and was he going to stay jim got out his hair ball and said something over it and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor it fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch jim tried it again and then another time and it acted just the same jim got down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened but it warnt no use he said it wouldnt talk he said sometimes it wouldnt talk without money i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warnt no good because the brass showed through the silver a little and it wouldnt pass nohow even if the brass didnt show because it was so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on it every time i reckoned i wouldnt say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge i said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hair ball would take it because maybe it wouldnt know the difference jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hair ball would think it was good he said he would split open a raw irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night and next morning you couldnt see no brass and it wouldnt feel greasy no more and so anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hair ball well i knowed a potato would do that before but i had forgot it jim put the quarter under the hair ball and got down and listened again this time he said the hair ball was all right he said it would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to i says go on so the hair ball talked to jim and jim told it to me he says yo ole father doan know yit what hes a gwyne to do sometimes he spec he ll go way en den agin he spec he ll stay de bes way is to res easy en let de ole man take his own way deys two angels hoverin roun bout

shut the door to then i turned around and there he was i used to be scared of him all the time he tanned me so much i reckoned i was scared now too but in a minute i see i was mistaken that is after the first jolt as you may say when my breath sort of hitched he being so unexpected but right away after i see i warnt scared of him worth bothring about he was most fifty and he looked it his hair was long and tangled and greasy and hung down and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines it was all black no gray so was his long mixed up whiskers there warnt no color in his face where his face showed it was white not like another mans white but a white to make a body sick a white to make a bodys flesh crawl a tree toad white a fish belly white as for his clothes just rags that was all he had one ankle resting on t other knee the boot on that foot was busted and two of his toes stuck through and he worked them now and then his hat was laying on the floor an old black slouch with the top caved in like a lid i stood a looking at him he set there a looking at me with his chair tilted back a little i set the candle down i noticed the window was up so he had

and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky said he hadnt had a drink all day when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him and when i reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again and told me to mind about that school because he was going to lay for me and lick me if i didnt drop that next day he was drunk and he went to judge thatchers and bullyragged him and tried to make him give up the money but he couldnt and then he swore hed make the law force him the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge that had just come and he didnt know the old man so he said courts mustnt interfere and separate families if they could help it said hed druther not take a child away from its father so judge thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business that pleased the old man till he couldnt rest he said hed cowhide me till i was black and blue if i didnt raise some money for him i borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher and pap took it and got drunk and went a blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight then they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailed him again for a week but he said he was satisfied said he was boss of his son and hed make it warm for him when he got out the new judge said he was a going to make a man of him so he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was just old pie to him so to speak and after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried and said hed been a fool and fooled away his life but now he was a going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldnt be ashamed of and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him the judge said he could hug him for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again pap said hed been a man that had always been misunderstood before and the judge said he believed it the old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they cried again and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand and says look at it gentlemen and ladies all take a hold of it shake it theres a hand that was the hand of a hog but it aint so no more its the hand of a man thats started in on a new life and ll die before he ll go back you mark them words dont forget i said them its a clean hand now shake it dont be afeard so they shook it one after the other all around and cried the judges wife she kissed it then the old man he signed a pledge made his mark the judge said it was the holiest time on record or something like that then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which was the spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty rod and clumb back again and had a good old time and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun up and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it the judge he felt kind of sore he said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun maybe but he didnt know no other way chapter vi well pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he went for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and he went for me too for not stopping school he catched me a couple of times and thrashed me but i went to school just the same and dodged him or outrun him most of the time i didnt want to go to school much before but i reckoned id go now to spite pap that law trial was a slow business appeared like they warnt ever going to get started on it so every now and then id borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him to keep from getting a cowhiding every time he got money he got drunk and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town and every time he raised cain he got jailed he was just suited this kind of thing was right in his line he got to hanging around the widows too much and so she told him at last that if he didnt quit using around there she would make trouble for him well wasnt he mad he said he would show who was huck finns boss so he watched out for me one day in the spring and catched me and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff and crossed over to the illinois shore where it was woody and there warnt no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldnt find it if you didnt know where it was he kept me with him all the time and i never got a chance to run off we lived in that old cabin and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights he had a gun which he had stole i reckon and we fished and hunted and that was what we lived on every little while he locked me in and went down to the store three miles to the ferry and traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time and licked me the widow she found out where i was by and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me but pap drove him off with the gun and it warnt long after that till i was used to being where i was and liked it all but the cowhide part it was kind of lazy and jolly laying off comfortable all day smoking and fishing and no books nor study two months or more run along and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt and i didnt see how id ever got to like it so well at the widows where you had to wash and eat on a plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be forever bothering over a book and have old miss watson pecking at you all the time i didnt want to go back no more i had stopped cussing because the widow didnt like it but now i took to it again because pap hadnt no objections it was pretty good times up in the woods there take it all around but by and by pap got too handy with his hick ry and i couldnt stand it i was all over welts he got to going away so much too and locking me in once he locked me in and was gone three days it was dreadful lonesome i judged he had got drownded and i wasnt ever going to get out any more i was scared i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time but i couldnt find no way there warnt a window to it big enough for a dog to get through i couldnt get up the chimbly it was too narrow the door was thick solid oak slabs pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times well i was most all the time at it because it was about the only way to put in the time but this time i found something at last i found an old rusty wood saw without any handle it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof i greased it up and went to work there was an old horse blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out i got under the table and raised the blanket and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out big enough to let me through well it was a good long job but i was getting towards the end of it when i heard paps gun in the woods i got rid of the signs of my work and dropped the blanket and hid my saw and pretty soon pap come in pap warnt in a good humor so he was his natural self he said he was down town and everything was going wrong his lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial but then there was ways to put it off a long time and judge thatcher knowed how to do it and he said people allowed thered be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian and they guessed it would win this time this shook me up considerable because i didnt want to go back to the widows any more and be so cramped up and sivilized as they called it then the old man got to cussing and cussed everything and everybody he could think of and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadnt skipped any and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round including a considerable parcel of people which he didnt know the names of and so called them whats his name when he got to them and went right along with his cussing he said he would like to see the widow get me he said he would watch out and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldnt find me that made me pretty uneasy again but only for a minute i reckoned i wouldnt stay on hand till he got that chance the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got there was a fifty pound sack of corn meal and a side of bacon ammunition and a four gallon jug of whisky and an old book and two newspapers for wadding besides some tow i toted up a load and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest i thought it all over and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some lines and take to the woods when i run away i guessed i wouldnt stay in one place but just tramp right across the country mostly night times and hunt and fish to keep alive and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldnt ever find me any more i judged i would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough and i reckoned he would i got so full of it i didnt notice how long i was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether i was asleep or drownded i got the things all up to the cabin and then it was about dark while i was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up and went to ripping again he had been drunk over in town and laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at a body would a thought he was adam he was just all mud whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment this time he says call this a govment why just look at it and see what its like heres the law a standing ready to take a mans son away from him a mans own son which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising yes just as that man has got that son raised at last and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin for him and give him a rest the law up and goes for him and they call that govment that aint all nuther the law backs that old judge thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o my property heres what the law does the law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up ards and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this and lets him go round in clothes that aint fitten for a hog they call that govment a man cant get his rights in a govment like this sometimes i ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all yes and i told em so i told old thatcher so to his face lots of em heard me and can tell what i said says i for two cents id leave the blamed country and never come a near it agin thems the very words i says look at my hat if you call it a hat but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till its below my chin and then it aint rightly a hat at all but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o stove pipe look at it says i such a hat for me to wear one of the wealthiest men in this town if i could git my rights oh yes this is a wonderful govment wonderful why looky here there was a free nigger there from ohio a mulatter most as white as a white man he had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and the shiniest hat and there aint a man in that town thats got as fine clothes as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and a silver headed cane the awfulest old gray headed nabob in the state and what do you think they said he was a p fessor in a college and could talk all kinds of languages and knowed everything and that aint the wust they said he could vote when he was at home well that let me out thinks i what is the country a coming to it was lection day and i was just about to go and vote myself if i warnt too drunk to get there but when they told me there was a state in this country where theyd let that nigger vote i drawed out i says i ll never vote agin thems the very words i said they all heard me and the country may rot for all me i ll never vote agin as long as i live and to see the cool way of that nigger why he wouldnt a give me the road if i hadnt shoved him out o the way i says to the people why aint this nigger put up at auction and sold thats what i want to know and what do you reckon they said why they said he couldnt be sold till hed been in the state six months and he hadnt been there that long yet there now thats a specimen they call that a govment that cant sell a free nigger till hes been in the state six months heres a govment that calls itself a govment and lets on to be a govment and thinks it is a govment and yets got to set stock still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling thieving infernal white shirted free nigger and pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language mostly hove at the nigger and the govment though he give the tub some too all along here and there he hopped around the cabin considerable first on one leg and then on the other holding first one shin and then the other one and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick but it warnt good judgment because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it so now he raised a howl that fairly made a bodys hair raise and down he went in the dirt and rolled there and held his toes and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous he said so his own self afterwards he had heard old sowberry hagan in his best days and he said it laid over him too but i reckon that was sort of piling it on maybe after supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens that was always his word i judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then i would steal the key or saw myself out one or t other he drank and drank and tumbled down on his blankets by and by but luck didnt run my way he didnt go sound asleep but was uneasy he groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time at last i got so sleepy i couldnt keep my eyes open all i could do and so before i knowed what i was about i was sound asleep and the candle burning i dont know how long i was asleep but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and i was up there was pap looking wild and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes he said they was crawling up his legs and then he would give a jump and scream and say one had bit him on the cheek but i couldnt see no snakes he started and run round and round the cabin hollering take him off take him off hes biting me on the neck i never see a man look so wild in the eyes pretty soon he was all fagged out and fell down panting then he rolled over and over wonderful fast kicking things every which way and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands and screaming and saying there was devils a hold of him he wore out by and by and laid still a while moaning then he laid stiller and didnt make a sound i could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods and it seemed terrible still he was laying over by the corner by and by he raised up part way and listened with his head to one side he says very low tramp tramp tramp thats the dead tramp tramp tramp they re coming after me but i wont go oh they re here dont touch me dont hands off they re cold let go oh let a poor devil alone then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let him alone and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table still a begging and then he went to crying i could hear him through the blanket by and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild and he see me and went for me he chased me round and round the place with a clasp knife calling me the angel of death and saying he would kill me and then i couldnt come for him no more i begged and told him i was only huck but he laughed such a screechy laugh and roared and cussed and kept on chasing me up once when i turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders and i thought i was gone but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightning and saved myself pretty soon he was all tired out and dropped down with his back against the door and said he would rest a minute and then kill me he put his knife under him and said he would sleep and get strong and then he would see who was who so he dozed off pretty soon by and by i got the old split bottom chair and clumb up as easy as i could not to make any noise and got down the gun i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded then i laid it across the turnip barrel pointing towards pap and set down behind it to wait for him to stir and how slow and still the time did drag along chapter vii git up what you bout i opened my eyes and looked around trying to make out where i was it was after sun up and i had been sound asleep pap was standing over me looking sour and sick too he says what you doin with this gun i judged he didnt know nothing about what he had been doing so i says somebody tried to get in so i was laying for him why didnt you roust me out well i tried to but i couldnt i couldnt budge you well all right dont stand there palavering all day but out with you and see if theres a fish on the lines for breakfast i ll be along in a minute he unlocked the door and i cleared out up the river bank i noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down and a sprinkling of bark so i knowed the river had begun to rise i reckoned i would have great times now if i was over at the town the june rise used to be always luck for me because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down and pieces of log rafts sometimes a dozen logs together so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood yards and the sawmill i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t other one out for what the rise might fetch along well all at once here comes a canoe just a beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long riding high like a duck i shot head first off of the bank like a frog clothes and all on and struck out for the canoe i just expected thered be somebody laying down in it because people often done that to fool folks and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it theyd raise up and laugh at him but it warnt so this time it was a drift canoe sure enough and i clumb in and paddled her ashore thinks i the old man will be glad when he sees this shes worth ten dollars but when i got to shore pap wasnt in sight yet and as i was running her into a little creek like a gully all hung over with vines and willows i struck another idea i judged id hide her good and then stead of taking to the woods when i run off id go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good and not have such a rough time tramping on foot it was pretty close to the shanty and i thought i heard the old man coming all the time but i got her hid and then i out and looked around a bunch of willows and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun so he hadnt seen anything when he got along i was hard at it taking up a trot line he abused me a little for being so slow but i told him i fell in the river and that was what made me so long i knowed he would see i was wet and then he would be asking questions we got five catfish off the lines and went home while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us being about wore out i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me you see all kinds of things might happen well i didnt see no way for a while but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water and he says another time a man comes a prowling round here you roust me out you hear that man warnt here for no good id a shot him next time you roust me out you hear then he dropped down and went to sleep again but what he had been saying give me the very idea i wanted i says to myself i can fix it now so nobody wont think of following me about twelve o clock we turned out and went along up the bank the river was coming up pretty fast and lots of driftwood going by on the rise by and by along comes part of a log raft nine logs fast together we went out with the skiff and towed it ashore then we had dinner anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through so as to catch more stuff but that warnt paps style nine logs was enough for one time he must shove right over to town and sell so he locked me in and took the skiff and started off towing the raft about half past three i judged he wouldnt come back that night i waited till i reckoned he had got a good start then i out with my saw and went to work on that log again before he was t other side of the river i was out of the hole him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in then i done the same with the side of bacon then the whisky jug i took all the coffee and sugar there was and all the ammunition i took the wadding i took the bucket and gourd i took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and two blankets and the skillet and the coffee pot i took fish lines and matches and other things everything that was worth a cent i cleaned out the place i wanted an axe but there wasnt any only the one out at the woodpile and i knowed why i was going to leave that i fetched out the gun and now i was done i had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things so i fixed that as good as i could from the outside by scattering dust on the place which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust then i fixed the piece of log back into its place and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent up at that place and didnt quite touch ground if you stood four or five foot away and didnt know it was sawed you wouldnt never notice it and besides this was the back of the cabin and it warnt likely anybody would go fooling around there it was all grass clear to the canoe so i hadnt left a track i followed around to see i stood on the bank and looked out over the river all safe so i took the gun and went up a piece into the woods and was hunting around for some birds when i see a wild pig hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms i shot this fellow and took him into camp i took the axe and smashed in the door i beat it and hacked it considerable a doing it i fetched the pig in and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe and laid him down on the ground to bleed i say ground because it was ground hard packed and no boards well next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it all i could drag and i started it from the pig and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in and down it sunk out of sight you could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground i did wish tom sawyer was there i knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business and throw in the fancy touches nobody could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing as that well last i pulled out some of my hair and blooded the axe good and stuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner then i took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldnt drip till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river now i thought of something else so i went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house i took the bag to where it used to stand and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw for there warnt no knives and forks on the place pap done everything with his clasp knife about the cooking then i carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes and ducks too you might say in the season there was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away i dont know where but it didnt go to the river the meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake i dropped paps whetstone there too so as to look like it had been done by accident then i tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string so it wouldnt leak no more and took it and my saw to the canoe again it was about dark now so i dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise i made fast to a willow then i took a bite to eat and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan i says to myself they ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me and they ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things they wont ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass they ll soon get tired of that and wont bother no more about me all right i can stop anywhere i want to jacksons island is good enough for me i know that island pretty well and nobody ever comes there and then i can paddle over to town nights and slink around and pick up things i want jacksons islands the place i was pretty tired and the first thing i knowed i was asleep when i woke up i didnt know where i was for a minute i set up and looked around a little scared then i remembered the river looked miles and miles across the moon was so bright i could a counted the drift logs that went a slipping along black and still hundreds of yards out from shore everything was dead quiet and it looked late and smelt late you know what i mean i dont know the words to put it in i took a good gap and a stretch and was just going to unhitch and start when i heard a sound away over the water i listened pretty soon i made it out it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when its a still night i peeped out through the willow branches and there it was a skiff away across the water i couldnt tell how many was in it it kept a coming and when it was abreast of me i see there warnt but one man in it thinks i maybe its pap though i warnt expecting him he dropped below me with the current and by and by he came a swinging up shore in the easy water and he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him well it was pap sure enough and sober too by the way he laid his oars i didnt lose no time the next minute i was a spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank i made two mile and a half and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river because pretty soon i would be passing the ferry landing and people might see me and hail me i got out amongst the driftwood and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float i laid there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe looking away into the sky not a cloud in it the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine i never knowed it before and how far a body can hear on the water such nights i heard people talking at the ferry landing i heard what they said too every word of it one man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights nowt other one said this warnt one of the short ones he reckoned and then they laughed and he said it over again and they laughed again then they waked up another fellow and told him and laughed but he didnt laugh he ripped out something brisk and said let him alone the first fellow said he lowed to tell it to his old woman she would think it was pretty good but he said that warnt nothing to some things he had said in his time i heard one man say it was nearly three o clock and he hoped daylight wouldnt wait more than about a week longer after that the talk got further and further away and i couldnt make out the words any more but i could hear the mumble and now and then a laugh too but it seemed a long ways off i was away below the ferry now i rose up and there was jacksons island about two mile and a half down stream heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river big and dark and solid like a steamboat without any lights there warnt any signs of the bar at the head it was all under water now it didnt take me long to get there i shot past the head at a ripping rate the current was so swift and then i got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the illinois shore i run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that i knowed about i had to part the willow branches to get in and when i made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town three mile away where there was three or four lights twinkling a monstrous big lumber raft was about a mile up stream coming along down with a lantern in the middle of it i watched it come creeping down and when it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say stern oars there heave her head to stabboard i heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side there was a little gray in the sky now so i stepped into the woods and laid down for a nap before breakfast chapter viii the sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eight o clock i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied i could see the sun out at one or two holes but mostly it was big trees all about and gloomy in there amongst them there was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves and the freckled places swapped about a little showing there was a little breeze up there a couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly i was powerful lazy and comfortable didnt want to get up and cook breakfast well i was dozing off again when i thinks i hears a deep sound of boom away up the river i rouses up and rests on my elbow and listens pretty soon i hears it again i hopped up and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves and i see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up about abreast the ferry and there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down i knowed what was the matter now boom i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboats side you see they was firing cannon over the water trying to make my carcass come to the top i was pretty hungry but it warnt going to do for me to start a fire because they might see the smoke so i set there and watched the cannon smoke and listened to the boom the river was a mile wide there and it always looks pretty on a summer morning so i was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if i only had a bite to eat well then i happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there so says i i ll keep a lookout and if any of thems floating around after me i ll give them a show i changed to the illinois edge of the island to see what luck i could have and i warnt disappointed a big double loaf come along and i most got it with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated out further of course i was where the current set in the closest to the shore i knowed enough for that but by and by along comes another one and this time i won i took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver and set my teeth in it was bakers bread what the quality eat none of your low down corn pone i got a good place amongst the leaves and set there on a log munching the bread and watching the ferry boat and very well satisfied and then something struck me i says now i reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me and here it has gone and done it so there aint no doubt but there is something in that thing that is theres something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays but it dont work for me and i reckon it dont work for only just the right kind i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching the ferryboat was floating with the current and i allowed id have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along because she would come in close where the bread did when shed got pretty well along down towards me i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place where the log forked i could peep through by and by she come along and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore most everybody was on the boat pap and judge thatcher and bessie thatcher and jo harper and tom sawyer and his old aunt polly and sid and mary and plenty more everybody was talking about the murder but the captain broke in and says look sharp now the current sets in the closest here and maybe hes washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the waters edge i hope so anyway i didnt hope so they all crowded up and leaned over the rails nearly in my face and kept still watching with all their might i could see them first rate but they couldnt see me then the captain sung out stand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke and i judged i was gone if theyd a had some bullets in i reckon theyd a got the corpse they was after well i see i warnt hurt thanks to goodness the boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island i could hear the booming now and then further and further off and by and by after an hour i didnt hear it no more the island was three mile long i judged they had got to the foot and was giving it up but they didnt yet a while they turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the missouri side under steam and booming once in a while as they went i crossed over to that side and watched them when they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the missouri shore and went home to the town i knowed i was all right now nobody else would come a hunting after me i got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods i made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldnt get at them i catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw and towards sundown i started my camp fire and had supper then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast when it was dark i set by my camp fire smoking and feeling pretty well satisfied but by and by it got sort of lonesome and so i went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down and then went to bed there aint no better way to put in time when you are lonesome you cant stay so you soon get over it and so for three days and nights no difference just the same thing but the next day i went exploring around down through the island i was boss of it it all belonged to me so to say and i wanted to know all about it but mainly i wanted to put in the time i found plenty strawberries ripe and prime and green summer grapes and green razberries and the green blackberries was just beginning to show they would all come handy by and by i judged well i went fooling along in the deep woods till i judged i warnt far from the foot of the island i had my gun along but i hadnt shot nothing it was for protection thought i would kill some game nigh home about this time i mighty near stepped on a good sized snake and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers and i after it trying to get a shot at it i clipped along and all of a sudden i bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking my heart jumped up amongst my lungs i never waited for to look further but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever i could every now and then i stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened but my breath come so hard i couldnt hear nothing else i slunk along another piece further then listened again and so on and so on if i see a stump i took it for a man if i trod on a stick and broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and i only got half and the short half too when i got to camp i warnt feeling very brash there warnt much sand in my craw but i says this aint no time to be fooling around so i got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight and i put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last years camp and then clumb a tree i reckon i was up in the tree two hours but i didnt see nothing i didnt hear nothing i only thought i heard and seen as much as a thousand things well i couldnt stay up there forever so at last i got down but i kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time all i could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast by the time it was night i was pretty hungry so when it was good and dark i slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the illinois bank about a quarter of a mile i went out in the woods and cooked a supper and i had about made up my mind i would stay there all night when i hear a plunkety plunk plunkety plunk and says to myself horses coming and next i hear peoples voices i got everything into the canoe as quick as i could and then went creeping through the woods to see what i could find out i hadnt got far when i hear a man say we better camp here if we can find a good place the horses is about beat out lets look around i didnt wait but shoved out and paddled away easy i tied up in the old place and reckoned i would sleep in the canoe i didnt sleep much i couldnt somehow for thinking and every time i waked up i thought somebody had me by the neck so the sleep didnt do me no good by and by i says to myself i cant live this way im a going to find out who it is thats here on the island with me i ll find it out or bust well i felt better right off so i took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows the moon was shining and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day i poked along well on to an hour everything still as rocks and sound asleep well by this time i was most down to the foot of the island a little ripply cool breeze begun to blow and that was as good as saying the night was about done i give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore then i got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods i sat down there on a log and looked out through the leaves i see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket the river but in a little while i see a pale streak over the treetops and knowed the day was coming so i took my gun and slipped off towards where i had run across that camp fire stopping every minute or two to listen but i hadnt no luck somehow i couldnt seem to find the place but by and by sure enough i catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees i went for it cautious and slow by and by i was close enough to have a look and there laid a man on the ground it most give me the fan tods he had a blanket around his head and his head was nearly in the fire i set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him and kept my eyes on him steady it was getting gray daylight now pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket and it was miss watsons jim i bet i was glad to see him i says hello jim and skipped out he bounced up and stared at me wild then he drops down on his knees and puts his hands together and says doan hurt me dont i haint ever done no harm to a ghos i alwuz liked dead people en done all i could for em you go en git in de river agin whah you b longs en doan do nuffn to ole jim at uz awluz yo fren well i warnt long making him understand i warnt dead i was ever so glad to see jim i warnt lonesome now i told him i warnt afraid of him telling the people where i was i talked along but he only set there and looked at me never said nothing then i says its good daylight les get breakfast make up your camp fire good whats de use er makin up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck but you got a gun haint you den we kin git sumfn

and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees i fetched meal and bacon and coffee and coffee pot and frying pan and sugar and tin cups and the nigger was set back considerable because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft i catched a good big catfish too and jim cleaned him with his knife and fried him when breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot jim laid it in with all his might for he was most about starved then when we had got pretty well stuffed we laid off and lazied by and by jim says but looky here huck who wuz it dat uz killed in dat shanty ef it warnt you then i told him the whole thing and he said it was smart he said tom sawyer couldnt get up no better plan than what i had then i says how do you come to be here jim and howd

granny said his father would die and he did and jim said you mustnt count the things you are going to cook for dinner because that would bring bad luck the same if you shook the table cloth after sundown and he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died the bees must be told about it before sun up next morning or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die jim said bees wouldnt sting idiots but i didnt believe that because i had tried them lots of times myself and they wouldnt sting me i had heard about some of these things before but not all of them jim knowed all

eight hundd dollars i wisht i had de money i wouldn want no mo chapter ix i wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that id found when i was exploring so we started and soon got to it because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide this place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foot high we had a rough time getting to the top the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick we tramped and clumb around all over it and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on the side towards illinois the cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together and jim could stand up straight in it it was cool in there jim was for putting our traps in there right away but i said we didnt want to be climbing up and down there all the time jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place and had all the traps in the cavern we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island and they would never find us without dogs and besides he said them little birds had said it was going to rain and did i want the things to get wet so we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavern and lugged all the traps up there then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in amongst the thick willows we took some fish off of the lines and set them again and begun to get ready for dinner the door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a good place to build a fire on so we built it there and cooked dinner we spread the blankets inside for a carpet and eat our dinner in there we put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern pretty soon it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten so the birds was right about it directly it begun to rain and it rained like all fury too and i never see the wind blow so it was one of these regular summer storms it would get so dark that it looked all blue black outside and lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider webby and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild and next when it was just about the bluest and blackest fst it was as bright as glory and youd have a little glimpse of tree tops a plunging about away off yonder in the storm hundreds of yards further than you could see before dark as sin again in a second and now youd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash and then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down the sky towards the under side of the world like rolling empty barrels down stairs where its long stairs and they bounce a good deal you know jim this is nice i says i wouldnt want to be nowhere else but here pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn bread well you wouldnt a ben heref it hadnt a ben for jim youd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner en gittn mos drownded too dat you would honey chickens knows when its gwyne to rain en so do de birds chile the river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days till at last it was over the banks the water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the illinois bottom on that side it was a good many miles wide but on the missouri side it was the same old distance across a half a mile because the missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe it was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside we went winding in and out amongst the trees and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way well on every old broken down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame on account of being hungry that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to but not the snakes and turtles they would slide off in the water the ridge our cavern was in was full of them we could a had pets enough if wed wanted them one night we catched a little section of a lumber raft nice pine planks it was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long and the top stood above water six or seven inches a solid level floor we could see saw logs go by in the daylight sometimes but we let them go we didnt show ourselves in daylight another night when we was up at the head of the island just before daylight here comes a frame house down on the west side she was a two story and tilted over considerable we paddled out and got aboard clumb in at an upstairs window but it was too dark to see yet so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight the light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island then we looked in at the window we could make out a bed and a table and two old chairs and lots of things around about on the floor and there was clothes hanging against the wall there was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man so jim says hello you but it didnt budge so i hollered again and then jim says de man aint asleep hes dead you hold still i ll go en see he went and bent down and looked and says its a dead man yes indeedy naked too hes ben shot in de back i reckn hes ben dead two er three days come in huck but doan look at his face its too gashly i didnt look at him at all jim throwed some old rags over him but he neednt done it i didnt want to see him there was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor and old whisky bottles and a couple of masks made out of black cloth and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal there was two old dirty calico dresses and a sun bonnet and some womens underclothes hanging against the wall and some mens clothing too we put the lot into the canoe it might come good there was a boys old speckled straw hat on the floor i took that too and there was a bottle that had had milk in it and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck we would a took the bottle but it was broke there was a seedy old chest and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke they stood open but there warnt nothing left in them that was any account the way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry and warnt fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff we got an old tin lantern and a butcher knife without any handle and a bran new barlow knife worth two bits in any store and a lot of tallow candles and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchet and some nails and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dog collar and a horseshoe and some vials of medicine that didnt have no label on them and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good curry comb and jim he found a ratty old fiddle bow and a wooden leg the straps was broke off of it but barring that it was a good enough leg though it was too long for me and not long enough for jim and we couldnt find the other one though we hunted all around and so take it all around we made a good haul when we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was pretty broad day so i made jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off i paddled over to the illinois shore and drifted down most a half a mile doing it i crept up the dead water under the bank and hadnt no accidents and didnt see nobody we got home all safe chapter x after breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed but jim didnt want to he said it would fetch bad luck and besides he said he might come and ha nt us he said a man that warnt buried was more likely to go a ha nting around than one that was planted and comfortable that sounded pretty reasonable so i didnt say no more but i couldnt keep from studying over it and wishing i knowed who shot the man and what they done it for we rummaged the clothes wed got and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat because if theyd a knowed the money was there they wouldnt a left it i said i reckoned they killed him too but jim didnt want to talk about that i says now you think its bad luck but what did you say when i fetched in the snake skin that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake skin with my hands well heres your bad luck we ve raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides i wish we could have some bad luck like this every day jim never you mind honey never you mind dont you git too peart its a comin mind i tell you its a comin it did come too it was a tuesday that we had that talk well after dinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge and got out of tobacco i went to the cavern to get some and found a rattlesnake in there i killed him and curled him up on the foot of jims blanket ever so natural thinking thered be some fun when jim found him there well by night i forgot all about the snake and when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the snakes mate was there and bit him he jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring i laid him out in a second with a stick and jim grabbed paps whisky jug and begun to pour it down he was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel that all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it jim told me to chop off the snakes head and throw it away and then skin the body and roast a piece of it i done it and he eat it and said it would help cure him he made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist too he said that that would help then i slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes for i warnt going to let jim find out it was all my fault not if i could help it jim sucked and sucked at the jug and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again his foot swelled up pretty big and so did his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so i judged he was all right but id druther been bit with a snake than paps whisky jim was laid up for four days and nights then the swelling was all gone and he was around again i made up my mind i wouldnt ever take a holt of a snake skin again with my hands now that i see what had come of it jim said he reckoned i would believe him next time and he said that handling a snake skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadnt got to the end of it yet he said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake skin in his hand well i was getting to feel that way myself though i ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do old hank bunker done it once and bragged about it and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot tower and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin and buried him so so they say but i didnt see it pap told me but anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way like a fool well the days went along and the river went down between its banks again and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man being six foot two inches long and weighed over two hundred pounds we couldnt handle him of course he would a flung us into illinois we just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded we found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball and lots of rubbage we split the ball open with the hatchet and there was a spool in it jim said hed had it there a long time to coat it over so and make a ball of it it was as big a fish as was ever catched in the mississippi i reckon jim said he hadnt ever seen a bigger one he would a been worth a good deal over at the village they peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market house there everybody buys some of him his meats as white as snow and makes a good fry next morning i said it was getting slow and dull and i wanted to get a stirring up some way i said i reckoned i would slip over the river and find out what was going on jim liked that notion but he said i must go in the dark and look sharp then he studied it over and said couldnt i put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl that was a good notion too so we shortened up one of the calico gowns and i turned up my trouser legs to my knees and got into it jim hitched it behind with the hooks and it was a fair fit i put on the sun bonnet and tied it under my chin and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove pipe jim said nobody would know me even in the daytime hardly i practiced around all day to get the hang of the things and by and by i could do pretty well in them only jim said i didnt walk like a girl and he said i must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches pocket i took notice and done better i started up the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark i started across to the town from a little below the ferry landing and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town i tied up and started along the bank there was a light burning in a little shanty that hadnt been lived in for a long time and i wondered who had took up quarters there i slipped up and peeped in at the window there was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table i didnt know her face she was a stranger for you couldnt start a face in that town that i didnt know now this was lucky because i was weakening i was getting afraid i had come people might know my voice and find me out but if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all i wanted to know so i knocked at the door and made up my mind i wouldnt forget i was a girl chapter xi come in says the woman and i did she says take a cheer i done it she looked me all over with her little shiny eyes and says what might your name be sarah williams where bouts do you live in this neighborhood nom in hookerville seven mile below i ve walked all the way and im all tired out hungry too i reckon i ll find you something nom i aint hungry i was so hungry i had to stop two miles below here at a farm so i aint hungry no more its what makes me so late my mothers down sick and out of money and everything and i come to tell my uncle abner moore he lives at the upper end of the town she says i haint ever been here before do you know him no but i dont know everybody yet i havent lived here quite two weeks its a considerable ways to the upper end of the town you better stay here all night take off your bonnet no i says i ll rest a while i reckon and go on i aint afeared of the dark she said she wouldnt let me go by myself but her husband would be in by and by maybe in a hour and a half and shed send him along with me then she got to talking about her husband and about her relations up the river and her relations down the river and about how much better off they used to was and how they didnt know but theyd made a mistake coming to our town instead of letting well alone and so on and so on till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along she told about me and tom sawyer finding the six thousand dollars only she got it ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was and what a hard lot i was and at last she got down to where i was murdered i says who done it we ve heard considerable about these goings on down in hookerville but we dont know who twas that killed huck finn well i reckon theres a right smart chance of people here thatd like to know who killed him some think old finn done it himself no is that so most everybody thought it at first he ll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched but before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named jim why he i stopped i reckoned i better keep still she run on and never noticed i had put in at all the nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed so theres a reward out for him three hundred dollars and theres a reward out for old finn too two hundred dollars you see he come to town the morning after the murder and told about it and was out with em on the ferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left before night they wanted to lynch him but he was gone you see well next day they found out the nigger was gone they found out he hadnt ben seen sence ten o clock the night the murder was done so then they put it on him you see and while they was full of it next day back comes old finn and went boo hooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over illinois with the judge gave him some and that evening he got drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard looking strangers and then went off with them well he haint come back sence and they aint looking for him back till this thing blows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it and then hed get hucks money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit people do say he warnt any too good to do it oh hes sly i reckon if he dont come back for a year he ll be all right you cant prove anything on him you know everything will be quieted down then and he ll walk in hucks money as easy as nothing yes i reckon som i dont see nothing in the way of it has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it oh no not everybody a good many thinks he done it but they ll get the nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of him why are they after him yet well you re innocent aint you does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up some folks think the nigger aint far from here im one of them but i haint talked it around a few days ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call jacksons island dont anybody live there says i no nobody says they i didnt say any more but i done some thinking i was pretty near certain id seen smoke over there about the head of the island a day or two before that so i says to myself like as not that niggers hiding over there anyway says i its worth the trouble to give the place a hunt i haint seen any smoke sence so i reckon maybe hes gone if it was him but husbands going over to see him and another man he was gone up the river but he got back to day and i told him as soon as he got here two hours ago i had got so uneasy i couldnt set still i had to do something with my hands so i took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it my hands shook and i was making a bad job of it when the woman stopped talking i looked up and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little i put down the needle and thread and let on to be interested and i was too and says three hundred dollars is a power of money i wish my mother could get it is your husband going over there to night oh yes he went up town with the man i was telling you of to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun they ll go over after midnight couldnt they see better if they was to wait till daytime yes and couldnt the nigger see better too after midnight he ll likely be asleep and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark if hes got one i didnt think of that the woman kept looking at me pretty curious and i didnt feel a bit comfortable pretty soon she says what did you say your name was honey m mary williams somehow it didnt seem to me that i said it was mary before so i didnt look up seemed to me i said it was sarah so i felt sort of cornered and was afeared maybe i was looking it too i wished the woman would say something more the longer she set still the uneasier i was but now she says honey i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in oh yesm i did sarah mary williams sarahs my first name some calls me sarah some calls me mary oh thats the way of it yesm i was feeling better then but i wished i was out of there anyway i couldnt look up yet well the woman fell to talking about how hard times was and how poor they had to live and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place and so forth and so on and then i got easy again she was right about the rats youd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while she said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone or they wouldnt give her no peace she showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot and said she was a good shot with it generly but shed wrenched her arm a day or two ago and didnt know whether she could throw true now but she watched for a chance and directly banged away at a rat but she missed him wide and said ouch it hurt her arm so then she told me to try for the next one i wanted to be getting away before the old man got back but of course i didnt let on i got the thing and the first rat that showed his nose i let drive and if hed a stayed where he was hed a been a tolerable sick rat she said that was first rate and she reckoned i would hive the next one she went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with i held up my two hands and she put the hank over them and went on talking about her and her husbands matters but she broke off to say keep your eye on the rats you better have the lead in your lap handy so she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment and i clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking but only about a minute then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face and very pleasant and says come now whats your real name wh what mum whats your real name is it bill or tom or bob or what is it i reckon i shook like a leaf and i didnt know hardly what to do but i says please to dont poke fun at a poor girl like me mum if im in the way here i ll no you wont set down and stay where you are i aint going to hurt you and i aint going to tell on you nuther you just tell me your secret and trust me i ll keep it and whats more i ll help you so ll my old man if you want him to you see you re a runaway prentice thats all it aint anything there aint no harm in it you ve been treated bad and you made up your mind to cut bless you child i wouldnt tell on you tell me all about it now thats a good boy so i said it wouldnt be no use to try to play it any longer and i would just make a clean breast and tell her everything but she musnt go back on her promise then i told her my father and mother was dead and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river and he treated me so bad i couldnt stand it no longer he went away to be gone a couple of days and so i took my chance and stole some of his daughters old clothes and cleared out and i had been three nights coming the thirty miles i traveled nights and hid daytimes and slept and the bag of bread and meat i carried from home lasted me all the way and i had a plenty i said i believed my uncle abner moore would take care of me and so that was why i struck out for this town of goshen goshen child this aint goshen this is st petersburg goshens ten mile further up the river who told you this was goshen why a man i met at daybreak this morning just as i was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep he told me when the roads forked i must take the right hand and five mile would fetch me to goshen he was drunk i reckon he told you just exactly wrong well he did act like he was drunk but it aint no matter now i got to be moving along i ll fetch goshen before daylight hold on a minute i ll put you up a snack to eat you might want it so she put me up a snack and says say when a cows laying down which end of her gets up first answer up prompt now dont stop to study over it which end gets up first the hind end mum well then a horse the for rard end mum which side of a tree does the moss grow on north side if fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction the whole fifteen mum well i reckon you have lived in the country i thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again whats your real name now george peters mum well try to remember it george dont forget and tell me its elexander before you go and then get out by saying its george elexander when i catch you and dont go about women in that old calico you do a girl tolerable poor but you might fool men maybe bless you child when you set out to thread a needle dont hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it hold the needle still and poke the thread at it thats the way a woman most always does but a man always does t other way and when you throw at a rat or anything hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can and miss your rat about six or seven foot throw stiff armed from the shoulder like there was a pivot there for it to turn on like a girl not from the wrist and elbow with your arm out to one side like a boy and mind you when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart she dont clap them together the way you did when you catched the lump of lead why i spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle and i contrived the other things just to make certain now trot along to your uncle sarah mary williams george elexander peters and if you get into trouble you send word to mrs judith loftus which is me and i ll do what i can to get you out of it keep the river road all the way and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you the river roads a rocky one and your feet ll be in a condition when you get to goshen i reckon i went up the bank about fifty yards and then i doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was a good piece below the house i jumped in and was off in a hurry i went up stream far enough to make the head of the island and then started across i took off the sun bonnet for i didnt want no blinders on then when i was about the middle i heard the clock begin to strike so i stops and listens the sound come faint over the water but clear eleven when i struck the head of the island i never waited to blow though i was most winded but i shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot then i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a half below as hard as i could go i landed and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern there jim laid sound asleep on the ground i roused him out and says git up and hump yourself jim there aint a minute to lose they re after us jim never asked no questions he never said a word but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared by that time everything we had in the world was on our raft and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing and didnt show a candle outside after that i took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look but if there was a boat around i couldnt see it for stars and shadows aint good to see by then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade past the foot of the island dead still never saying a word chapter xii it must a been close on to one o clock when we got below the island at last and the raft did seem to go mighty slow if a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinois shore and it was well a boat didnt come for we hadnt ever thought to put the gun in the canoe or a fishing line or anything to eat we was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things it warnt good judgment to put everything on the raft if the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i built and watched it all night for jim to come anyways they stayed away from us and if my building the fire never fooled them it warnt no fault of mine i played it as low down on them as i could when the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the illinois side and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave in in the bank there a tow head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow teeth we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois side and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place so we warnt afraid of anybody running across us we laid there all day and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the missouri shore and up bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle i told jim all about the time i had jabbering with that woman and jim said she was a smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnt set down and watch a camp fire no sir shed fetch a dog well then i said why couldnt she tell her husband to fetch a dog jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start and he believed they must a gone up town to get a dog and so they lost all that time or else we wouldnt be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village no indeedy we would be in that same old town again so i said i didnt care what was the reason they didnt get us as long as they didnt when it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket and looked up and down and across nothing in sight so jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy and to keep the things dry jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly the wigwam would keep it from being seen we made an extra steering oar too because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something we fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down stream to keep from getting run over but we wouldnt have to light it for up stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a crossing for the river was pretty high yet very low banks being still a little under water so up bound boats didnt always run the channel but hunted easy water this second night we run between seven and eight hours with a current that was making over four mile an hour we catched fish and talked and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness it was kind of solemn drifting down the big still river laying on our backs looking up at the stars and we didnt ever feel like talking loud and it warnt often that we laughed only a little kind of a low chuckle we had mighty good weather as a general thing and nothing ever happened to us at all that night nor the next nor the next every night we passed towns some of them away up on black hillsides nothing but just a shiny bed of lights not a house could you see the fifth night we passed st louis and it was like the whole world lit up in st petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in st louis but i never believed it till i see that wonderful spread of lights at two o clock that still night there warnt a sound there everybody was asleep every night now i used to slip ashore towards ten o clock at some little village and buy ten or fifteen cents worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat and sometimes i lifted a chicken that warnt roosting comfortable and took him along pap always said take a chicken when you get a chance because if you dont want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does and a good deed aint ever forgot i never see pap when he didnt want the chicken himself but that is what he used to say anyway mornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or things of that kind pap always said it warnt no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time but the widow said it warnt anything but a soft name for stealing and no decent body would do it jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldnt borrow them any more then he reckoned it wouldnt be no harm to borrow the others so we talked it over all one night drifting along down the river trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelons or what but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory and concluded to drop crabapples and p simmons we warnt feeling just right before that but it was all comfortable now i was glad the way it come out too because crabapples aint ever good and the p simmons wouldnt be ripe for two or three months yet we shot a water fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didnt go to bed early enough in the evening take it all round we lived pretty high the fifth night below st louis we had a big storm after midnight with a power of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in a solid sheet we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself when the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead and high rocky bluffs on both sides by and by says i hel lo jim looky yonder it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock we was drifting straight down for her the lightning showed her very distinct she was leaning over with part of her upper deck above water and you could see every little chimbly guy clean and clear and a chair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it when the flashes come well it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysterious like i felt just the way any other boy would a felt when i see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river i wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little and see what there was there so i says les land on her jim but jim was dead against it at first he says i doan want to go fooln long er no wrack wes doin blame well en we better let blame well alone as de good book says like as not deys a watchman on dat wrack watchman your grandmother i says there aint nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot house and do you reckon anybodys going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot house such a night as this when its likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute jim couldnt say nothing to that so he didnt try and besides i says we might borrow something worth having out of the captains stateroom seegars i bet you and cost five cents apiece solid cash steamboat captains is always rich and get sixty dollars a month and they dont care a cent what a thing costs you know long as they want it stick a candle in your pocket i cant rest jim till we give her a rummaging do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing not for pie he wouldnt hed call it an adventure thats what hed call it and hed land on that wreck if it was his last act and wouldnt he throw style into it wouldnt he spread himself nor nothing why youd think it was christopher c lumbus discovering kingdom come i wish tom sawyer was here jim he grumbled a little but give in he said we mustnt talk any more than we could help and then talk mighty low the lightning showed us the wreck again just in time and we fetched the stabboard derrick and made fast there the deck was high out here we went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard in the dark towards the texas feeling our way slow with our feet and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys for it was so dark we couldnt see no sign of them pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetched us in front of the captains door which was open and by jimminy away down through the texas hall we see a light and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick and told me to come along i says all right and was going to start for the raft but just then i heard a voice wail out and say oh please dont boys i swear i wont ever tell another voice said pretty loud its a lie jim turner you ve acted this way before you always want moren your share of the truck and you ve always got it too because you ve sworet if you didnt youd tell but this time you ve said it jest one time too many you re the meanest treacherousest hound in this country by this time jim was gone for the raft i was just a biling with curiosity and i says to myself tom sawyer wouldnt back out now and so i wont either im a going to see whats going on here so i dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage and crept aft in the dark till there warnt but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross hall of the texas then in there i see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot and two men standing over him and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol this one kept pointing the pistol at the mans head on the floor and saying id like to and i orter too a mean skunk the man on the floor would shrivel up and say oh please dont bill i haint ever goin to tell and every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say deed you aint you never said no truer thingn that you bet you and once he said hear him beg and yit if we hadnt got the best of him and tied him hed a killed us both and what for jist for nothn jist because we stood on our rights thats what for but i lay you aint a goin to threaten nobody any more jim turner put up that pistol bill bill says i dont want to jake packard im for killin him and didnt he kill old hatfield jist the same way and dont he deserve it but i dont want him killed and i ve got my reasons for it bless yo heart for them words jake packard i ll never forgit you longs i live says the man on the floor sort of blubbering packard didnt take no notice of that but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where i was there in the dark and motioned bill to come i crawfished as fast as i could about two yards but the boat slanted so that i couldnt make very good time so to keep from getting run over and catched i crawled into a stateroom on the upper side the man came a pawing along in the dark and when packard got to my stateroom he says here come in here and in he come and bill after him but before they got in i was up in the upper berth cornered and sorry i come then they stood there with their hands on the ledge of the berth and talked i couldnt see them but i could tell where they was by the whisky theyd been having i was glad i didnt drink whisky but it wouldnt made much difference anyway because most of the time they couldnt a treed me because i didnt breathe i was too scared and besides a body couldnt breathe and hear such talk they talked low and earnest bill wanted to kill turner he says hes said he ll tell and he will if we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldnt make no difference after the row and the way we ve served him shores you re born he ll turn states evidence now you hear me im for putting him out of his troubles som i says packard very quiet blame it id sorter begun to think you wasnt well then thats all right les go and do it hold on a minute i haint had my say yit you listen to me shootings good but theres quieter ways if the things got to be done but what i say is this it aint good sense to go courtn around after a halter if you can git at what you re up to in some way thats jist as good and at the same time dont bring you into no resks aint that so you bet it is but how you goin to manage it this time well my idea is this we ll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we ve overlooked in the staterooms and shove for shore and hide the truck then we ll wait now i say it aint a goin to be moren two hours befo this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river see he ll be drownded and wont have nobody to blame for it but his own self i reckon thats a considerble sight bettern killin of him im unfavorable to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it it aint good sense it aint good morals aint i right yes i reckn you are but s pose she dont break up and wash off well we can wait the two hours anyway and see cant we all right then come along so they started and i lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambled forward it was dark as pitch there but i said in a kind of a coarse whisper jim and he answered up right at my elbow with a sort of a moan and i says quick jim it aint no time for fooling around and moaning theres a gang of murderers in yonder and if we dont hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows cant get away from the wreck theres one of em going to be in a bad fix but if we find their boat we can put all of em in a bad fix for the sheriff ll get em quick hurry i ll hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard you start at the raft and oh my lordy lordy raf dey ain no raf no mo she done broke loose en gone i en here we is chapter xiii well i catched my breath and most fainted shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that but it warnt no time to be sentimentering wed got to find that boat now had to have it for ourselves so we went a quaking and shaking down the stabboard side and slow work it was too seemed a week before we got to the stern no sign of a boat jim said he didnt believe he could go any further so scared he hadnt hardly any strength left he said but i said come on if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix sure so on we prowled again we struck for the stern of the texas and found it and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight hanging on from shutter to shutter for the edge of the skylight was in the water when we got pretty close to the cross hall door there was the skiff sure enough i could just barely see her i felt ever so thankful in another second i would a been aboard of her but just then the door opened one of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me and i thought i was gone but he jerked it in again and says heave that blame lantern out o sight bill he flung a bag of something into the boat and then got in himself and set down it was packard then bill he come out and got in packard says in a low voice all ready shove off i couldnt hardly hang on to the shutters i was so weak but bill says hold ond you go through him no didnt you no so hes got his share o the cash yet well then come along no use to take truck and leave money say wont he suspicion what we re up to maybe he wont but we got to have it anyway come along so they got out and went in the door slammed to because it was on the careened side and in a half second i was in the boat and jim come tumbling after me i out with my knife and cut the rope and away we went we didnt touch an oar and we didnt speak nor whisper nor hardly even breathe we went gliding swift along dead silent past the tip of the paddle box and past the stern then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck and the darkness soaked her up every last sign of her and we was safe and knowed it when we was three or four hundred yards down stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as jim turner was then jim manned the oars and we took out after our raft now was the first time that i begun to worry about the men i reckon i hadnt had time to before i begun to think how dreadful it was even for murderers to be in such a fix i says to myself there aint no telling but i might come to be a murderer myself yet and then how would i like it so says i to jim the first light we see we ll land a hundred yards below it or above it in a place where its a good hiding place for you and the skiff and then i ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung when their time comes but that idea was a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm again and this time worse than ever the rain poured down and never a light showed everybody in bed i reckon we boomed along down the river watching for lights and watching for our raft after a long time the rain let up but the clouds stayed and the lightning kept whimpering and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead floating and we made for it it was the raft and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again we seen a light now away down to the right on shore so i said i would go for it the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck we hustled it on to the raft in a pile and i told jim to float along down and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile and keep it burning till i come then i manned my oars and shoved for the light as i got down towards it three or four more showed up on a hillside it was a village i closed in above the shore light and laid on my oars and floated as i went by i see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double hull ferryboat i skimmed around for the watchman a wondering whereabouts he slept and by and by i found him roosting on the bitts forward with his head down between his knees i gave his shoulder two or three little shoves and begun to cry he stirred up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch and then he says hello whats up dont cry bub whats the trouble i says pap and mam and sis and then i broke down he says oh dang it now dont take on so we all has to have our troubles and thisn ll come out all right whats the matter with em they re they re are you the watchman of the boat yes he says kind of pretty well satisfied like im the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck hand and sometimes im the freight and passengers i aint as rich as old jim hornback and i cant be so blame generous and good to tom dick and harry as what he is and slam around money the way he does but i ve told him a many a timet i wouldnt trade places with him for says i a sailors lifes the life for me and im derned if id live two mile out o town where there aint nothing ever goin on not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it says i i broke in and says they re in an awful peck of trouble and who is why pap and mam and sis and miss hooker and if youd take your ferryboat and go up there up where where are they on the wreck what wreck why there aint but one what you dont mean the walter scott yes good land what are they doin there for gracious sakes well they didnt go there a purpose i bet they didnt why great goodness there aint no chance for em if they dont git off mighty quick why how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape easy enough miss hooker was a visiting up there to the town yes booths landing go on she was a visiting there at booths landing and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse ferry to stay all night at her friends house miss what you may call her i disremember her name and they lost their steering oar and swung around and went a floating down stern first about two mile and saddle baggsed on the wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck well about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading scow and it was so dark we didnt notice the wreck till we was right on it and so we saddle baggsed but all of us was saved but bill whipple and oh he was the best cretur i most wisht it had been me i do my george its the beatenest thing i ever struck and then what did you all do well we hollered and took on but its so wide there we couldnt make nobody hear so pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow i was the only one that could swim so i made a dash for it and miss hooker she said if i didnt strike help sooner come here and hunt up her uncle and hed fix the thing i made the land about a mile below and been fooling along ever since trying to get people to do something but they said what in such a night and such a current there aint no sense in it go for the steam ferry now if you ll go and by jackson id like to and blame it i dont know but i will but who in the dingnations a going to pay for it do you reckon your pap why thats all right miss hooker she tole me particular that her uncle hornback great guns is he her uncle looky here you break for that light over yonder way and turn out west when you git there and about a quarter of a mile out you ll come to the tavern tell em to dart you out to jim hornbacks and he ll foot the bill and dont you fool around any because he ll want to know the news tell him i ll have his niece all safe before he can get to town hump yourself now im a going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer i struck for the light but as soon as he turned the corner i went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards and tucked myself in among some woodboats for i couldnt rest easy till i could see the ferryboat start but take it all around i was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang for not many would a done it i wished the widow knowed about it i judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in well before long here comes the wreck dim and dusky sliding along down a kind of cold shiver went through me and then i struck out for her she was very deep and i see in a minute there warnt much chance for anybody being alive in her i pulled all around her and hollered a little but there wasnt any answer all dead still i felt a little bit heavy hearted about the gang but not much for i reckoned if they could stand it i could then here comes the ferryboat so i shoved for the middle of the river on a long down stream slant and when i judged i was out of eye reach i laid on my oars and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for miss hookers remainders because the captain would know her uncle hornback would want them and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore and i laid into my work and went a booming down the river it did seem a powerful long time before jims light showed up and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off by the time i got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east so we struck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turned in and slept like dead people chapter xiv by and by when we got up we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck and found boots and blankets and clothes and all sorts of other things and a lot of books and a spyglass and three boxes of seegars we hadnt ever been this rich before in neither of our lives the seegars was prime we laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking and me reading the books and having a general good time i told jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat and i said these kinds of things was adventures but he said he didnt want no more adventures he said that when i went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died because he judged it was all up with him anyway it could be fixed for if he didnt get saved he would get drownded and if he did get saved whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward and then miss watson would sell him south sure well he was right he was most always right he had an uncommon level head for a nigger i read considerable to jim about kings and dukes and earls and such and how gaudy they dressed and how much style they put on and called each other your majesty and your grace and your lordship and so on

nigger to argue so i quit chapter xv we judged that three nights more would fetch us to cairo at the bottom of illinois where the ohio river comes in and that was what we was after we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the ohio amongst the free states and then be out of trouble well the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towhead to tie to for it wouldnt do to try to run in a fog but when i paddled ahead in the canoe with the line to make fast there warnt anything but little saplings to tie to i passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank but there was a stiff current and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went i see the fog closing down and it made me so sick and scared i couldnt budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me and then there warnt no raft in sight you couldnt see twenty yards i jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke but she didnt come i was in such a hurry i hadnt untied her i got up and tried to untie her but i was so excited my hands shook so i couldnt hardly do anything with them as soon as i got started i took out after the raft hot and heavy right down the towhead that was all right as far as it went but the towhead warnt sixty yards long and the minute i flew by the foot of it i shot out into the solid white fog and hadnt no more idea which way i was going than a dead man thinks i it wont do to paddle first i know i ll run into the bank or a towhead or something i got to set still and float and yet its mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time i whooped and listened away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop and up comes my spirits i went tearing after it listening sharp to hear it again the next time it come i see i warnt heading for it but heading away to the right of it and the next time i was heading away to the left of it and not gaining on it much either for i was flying around this way and that and t other but it was going straight ahead all the time i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all the time but he never did and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me well i fought along and directly i hears the whoop behind me i was tangled good now that was somebody elses whoop or else i was turned around i throwed the paddle down i heard the whoop again it was behind me yet but in a different place it kept coming and kept changing its place and i kept answering till by and by it was in front of me again and i knowed the current had swung the canoes head down stream and i was all right if that was jim and not some other raftsman hollering i couldnt tell nothing about voices in a fog for nothing dont look natural nor sound natural in a fog the whooping went on and in about a minute i come a booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared the currrent was tearing by them so swift in another second or two it was solid white and still again i set perfectly still then listening to my heart thump and i reckon i didnt draw a breath while it thumped a hundred i just give up then i knowed what the matter was that cut bank was an island and jim had gone down t other side of it it warnt no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes it had the big timber of a regular island it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide i kept quiet with my ears cocked about fifteen minutes i reckon i was floating along of course four or five miles an hour but you dont ever think of that no you feel like you are laying dead still on the water and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you dont think to yourself how fast you re going but you catch your breath and think my how that snags tearing along if you think it aint dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you try it once you ll see next for about a half an hour i whoops now and then at last i hears the answer a long ways off and tries to follow it but i couldnt do it and directly i judged id got into a nest of towheads for i had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me sometimes just a narrow channel between and some that i couldnt see i knowed was there because id hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks well i warnt long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads and i only tried to chase them a little while anyway because it was worse than chasing a jack o lantern you never knowed a sound dodge around so and swap places so quick and so much i had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times to keep from knocking the islands out of the river and so i judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing it was floating a little faster than what i was well i seemed to be in the open river again by and by but i couldnt hear no sign of a whoop nowheres i reckoned jim had fetched up on a snag maybe and it was all up with him i was good and tired so i laid down in the canoe and said i wouldnt bother no more i didnt want to go to sleep of course but i was so sleepy i couldnt help it so i thought i would take jest one little cat nap but i reckon it was more than a cat nap for when i waked up the stars was shining bright the fog was all gone and i was spinning down a big bend stern first first i didnt know where i was i thought i was dreaming and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week it was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks just a solid wall as well as i could see by the stars i looked away down stream and seen a black speck on the water i took after it but when i got to it it warnt nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together then i see another speck and chased that then another and this time i was right it was the raft when i got to it jim was setting there with his head down between his knees asleep with his right arm hanging over the steering oar the other oar was smashed off and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt so shed had a rough time i made fast and laid down under jims nose on the raft and began to gap and stretch my fists out against jim and says hello jim have i been asleep why didnt you stir me up goodness gracious is dat you huck en you ain dead you ain drownded yous back agin its too good for true honey its too good for true lemme look at you chile lemme feel o you no you ain dead yous back agin live en soun jis de same ole huck de same ole huck thanks to goodness whats the matter with you jim you been a drinking drinkin has i ben a drinkin has i had a chance to be a drinkin well then what makes you talk so wild how does i talk wild how why haint you been talking about my coming back and all that stuff as if id been gone away huck huck finn you look me in de eye look me in de eye

make fas to de tow head no i didnt what tow head i haint see no tow head you haint seen no towhead looky here didnt de line pull loose en de raf go a hummin down de river en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog what fog why de fog de fog dats been aroun all night en didnt you whoop en didnt i whoop tell we got mix up in de islands en one un us got los en t other one was jis as good as los kase he didn know whah he wuz en didnt i bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos git drownded now ain dat so boss aint it so you answer me dat well this is too many for me jim i haint seen no fog nor no islands nor no troubles nor nothing i been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago and i reckon i done the same you couldnt a got drunk in that time so of course you ve been dreaming dad fetch it how is i gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes well hang it all you did dream it because there didnt any of it happen but huck its all jis as plain to me as it dont make no difference how plain it is there aint nothing in it i know because i ve been here all the time jim didnt say nothing for about five minutes but set there studying over it then he says well den i reckn i did dream it huck but dog my cats ef it aint de powerfullest dream i ever see en i haint ever had no dream b fo dats tired me like dis one oh well thats all right because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes but this one was a staving dream tell me all about it jim so jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through just as it happened only he painted it up considerable then he said he must start in and terpret it because it was sent for a warning he said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good but the current was another man that would get us away from him the whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then and if we didnt try hard to make out to understand them theyd just take us into bad luck stead of keeping us out of it the lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks but if we minded our business and didnt talk back and aggravate them we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river which was the free states and wouldnt have no more trouble it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft but it was clearing up again now oh well thats all interpreted well enough as far as it goes jim i says but what does these things stand for it was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar you could see them first rate now jim looked at the trash and then looked at me and back at the trash again he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldnt seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away but when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling and says what do dey stan for i se gwyne to tell you when i got all wore out wid work en wid de callin for you en went to sleep my heart wuz mos broke bekase you wuz los en i didnk yer no mo what become er me en de raf en when i wake up en fine you back agin all safe en soun de tears come en i could a got down on my knees en kiss yo foot is so thankful en all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole jim wid a lie dat truck dah is trash en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey frens en makes em ashamed then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without saying anything but that but that was enough it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger but i done it and i warnt ever sorry for it afterwards neither i didnt do him no more mean tricks and i wouldnt done that one if id a knowed it would make him feel that way chapter xvi we slept most all day and started out at night a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession she had four long sweeps at each end so we judged she carried as many as thirty men likely she had five big wigwams aboard wide apart and an open camp fire in the middle and a tall flag pole at each end there was a power of style about her it amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that we went drifting down into a big bend and the night clouded up and got hot the river was very wide and was walled with solid timber on both sides you couldnt see a break in it hardly ever or a light we talked about cairo and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it i said likely we wouldnt because i had heard say there warnt but about a dozen houses there and if they didnt happen to have them lit up how was we going to know we was passing a town jim said if the two big rivers joined together there that would show but i said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again that disturbed jim and me too so the question was what to do i said paddle ashore the first time a light showed and tell them pap was behind coming along with a trading scow and was a green hand at the business and wanted to know how far it was to cairo jim thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it and waited there warnt nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town and not pass it without seeing it he said hed be mighty sure to see it because hed be a free man the minute he seen it but if he missed it hed be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom every little while he jumps up and says dah she is but it warnt it was jack o lanterns or lightning bugs so he set down again and went to watching same as before jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom well i can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish too to hear him because i begun to get it through my head that he was most free and who was to blame for it why me i couldnt get that out of my conscience no how nor no way it got to troubling me so i couldnt rest i couldnt stay still in one place it hadnt ever come home to me before what this thing was that i was doing but now it did and it stayed with me and scorched me more and more i tried to make out to myself that i warnt to blame because i didnt run jim off from his rightful owner but it warnt no use conscience up and says every time but you knowed he was running for his freedom and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody that was so i couldnt get around that noway that was where it pinched conscience says to me what had poor miss watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word what did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean why she tried to learn you your book she tried to learn you your manners she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how thats what she done i got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead i fidgeted up and down the raft abusing myself to myself and jim was fidgeting up and down past me we neither of us could keep still every time he danced around and says dahs cairo it went through me like a shot and i thought if it was cairo i reckoned i would die of miserableness jim talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself he was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent and when he got enough he would buy his wife which was owned on a farm close to where miss watson lived and then they would both work to buy the two children and if their master wouldnt sell them theyd get an ab litionist to go and steal them it most froze me to hear such talk he wouldnt ever dared to talk such talk in his life before just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free it was according to the old saying give a nigger an inch and he ll take an ell thinks i this is what comes of my not thinking here was this nigger which i had as good as helped to run away coming right out flat footed and saying he would steal his children children that belonged to a man i didnt even know a man that hadnt ever done me no harm i was sorry to hear jim say that it was such a lowering of him my conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever until at last i says to it let up on me it aint too late yet i ll paddle ashore at the first light and tell i felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off all my troubles was gone i went to looking out sharp for a light and sort of singing to myself by and by one showed jim sings out wes safe huck wes safe jump up and crack yo heels dats de good ole cairo at las i jis knows it i says i ll take the canoe and go and see jim it mightnt be you know he jumped and got the canoe ready and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on and give me the paddle and as i shoved off he says pooty soon i ll be a shoutn for joy en i ll say its all on accounts o huck is a free man en i couldnt ever ben free ef it hadn ben for huck huck done it jim wont ever forgit you huck yous de bes fren jims ever had en yous de only fren ole jims got now i was paddling off all in a sweat to tell on him but when he says this it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me i went along slow then and i warnt right down certain whether i was glad i started or whether i warnt when i was fifty yards off jim says dah you goes de ole true huck de ony white genlman dat ever kep his promise to ole jim well i just felt sick but i says i got to do it i cant get out of it right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns and they stopped and i stopped one of them says whats that yonder a piece of a raft i says do you belong on it yes sir any men on it only one sir well theres five niggers run off to night up yonder above the head of the bend is your man white or black i didnt answer up prompt i tried to but the words wouldnt come i tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it but i warnt man enough hadnt the spunk of a rabbit i see i was weakening so i just give up trying and up and says hes white i reckon we ll go and see for ourselves i wish you would says i because its pap thats there and maybe youd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is hes sick and so is mam and mary ann oh the devil we re in a hurry boy but i s pose we ve got to come buckle to your paddle and lets get along i buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars when we had made a stroke or two i says pap ll be mighty much obleeged to you i can tell you everybody goes away when i want them to help me tow the raft ashore and i cant do it by myself well thats infernal mean odd too say boy whats the matter with your father its the a the well it aint anything much they stopped pulling it warnt but a mighty little ways to the raft now one says boy thats a lie what is the matter with your pap answer up square now and it ll be the better for you i will sir i will honest but dont leave us please its the the gentlemen if you ll only pull ahead and let me heave you the headline you wont have to come a near the raft please do set her back john set her back says one they backed water keep away boy keep to looard confound it i just expect the wind has blowed it to us your paps got the small pox and you know it precious well why didnt you come out and say so do you want to spread it all over well says i a blubbering i ve told everybody before and they just went away and left us poor devil theres something in that we are right down sorry for you but we well hang it we dont want the small pox you see look here i ll tell you what to do dont you try to land by yourself or you ll smash everything to pieces you float along down about twenty miles and you ll come to a town on the left hand side of the river it will be long after sun up then and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever dont be a fool again and let people guess what is the matter now we re trying to do you a kindness so you just put twenty miles between us thats a good boy it wouldnt do any good to land yonder where the light is its only a wood yard say i reckon your fathers poor and im bound to say hes in pretty hard luck here i ll put a twenty dollar gold piece on this board and you get it when it floats by i feel mighty mean to leave you but my kingdom it wont do to fool with small pox dont you see hold on parker says the other man heres a twenty to put on the board for me good bye boy you do as mr parker told you and you ll be all right thats so my boy good bye good bye if you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them and you can make some money by it good bye sir says i i wont let no runaway niggers get by me if i can help it they went off and i got aboard the raft feeling bad and low because i knowed very well i had done wrong and i see it warnt no use for me to try to learn to do right a body that dont get started right when hes little aint got no show when the pinch comes there aint nothing to back him up and keep him to his work and so he gets beat then i thought a minute and says to myself hold ons pose youd a done right and give jim up would you felt better than what you do now no says i id feel bad id feel just the same way i do now well then says i whats the use you learning to do right when its troublesome to do right and aint no trouble to do wrong and the wages is just the same i was stuck i couldnt answer that so i reckoned i wouldnt bother no more about it but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time i went into the wigwam jim warnt there i looked all around he warnt anywhere i says jim here i is huck is dey out o sight yit dont talk loud he was in the river under the stern oar with just his nose out i told him they were out of sight so he come aboard he says i was a listenin to all de talk en i slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho if dey come aboard den i was gwyne to swim to de raf agin when dey was gone but lawsy how you did fool em huck dat wuz de smartes dodge i tell you chile i spec it save ole jim ole jim aint going to forgit you for dat honey then we talked about the money it was a pretty good raise twenty dollars apiece jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states he said twenty mile more warnt far for the raft to go but he wished we was already there towards daybreak we tied up and jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good then he worked all day fixing things in bundles and getting all ready to quit rafting that night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left hand bend i went off in the canoe to ask about it pretty soon i found a man out in the river with a skiff setting a trot line i ranged up and says mister is that town cairo cairo no you must be a blame fool what town is it mister if you want to know go and find out if you stay here botherin around me for about a half a minute longer you ll get something you wont want i paddled to the raft jim was awful disappointed but i said never mind cairo would be the next place i reckoned we passed another town before daylight and i was going out again but it was high ground so i didnt go no high ground about cairo jim said i had forgot it we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left hand bank i begun to suspicion something so did jim i says maybe we went by cairo in the fog that night he says doan les talk about it huck po niggers cant have no luck i awluz spected dat rattlesnake skin warnt done wid its work i wish id never seen that snake skin jim i do wish id never laid eyes on it it aint yo fault huck you didn know dont you blame yo self bout it when it was daylight here was the clear ohio water inshore sure enough and outside was the old regular muddy so it was all up with cairo we talked it all over it wouldnt do to take to the shore we couldnt take the raft up the stream of course there warnt no way but to wait for dark and start back in the canoe and take the chances so we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the work and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone we didnt say a word for a good while there warnt anything to say we both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake skin so what was the use to talk about it it would only look like we was finding fault and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck and keep on fetching it too till we knowed enough to keep still by and by we talked about what we better do and found there warnt no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in we warnt going to borrow it when there warnt anybody around the way pap would do for that might set people after us so we shoved out after dark on the raft anybody that dont believe yet that its foolishness to handle a snake skin after all that that snake skin done for us will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us the place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore but we didnt see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours and more well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the next meanest thing to fog you cant tell the shape of the river and you cant see no distance it got to be very late and still and then along comes a steamboat up the river we lit the lantern and judged she would see it up stream boats didnt generly come close to us they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river we could hear her pounding along but we didnt see her good till she was close she aimed right for us often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs and thinks hes mighty smart well here she comes and we said she was going to try and shave us but she didnt seem to be sheering off a bit she was a big one and she was coming in a hurry too looking like a black cloud with rows of glow worms around it but all of a sudden she bulged out big and scary with a long row of wide open furnace doors shining like red hot teeth and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us there was a yell at us and a jingling of bells to stop the engines a powwow of cussing and whistling of steam and as jim went overboard on one side and i on the other she come smashing straight through the raft i dived and i aimed to find the bottom too for a thirty foot wheel had got to go over me and i wanted it to have plenty of room i could always stay under water a minute this time i reckon i stayed under a minute and a half then i bounced for the top in a hurry for i was nearly busting i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose and puffed a bit of course there was a booming current and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them for they never cared much for raftsmen so now she was churning along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though i could hear her i sung out for jim about a dozen times but i didnt get any answer so i grabbed a plank that touched me while i was treading water and struck out for shore shoving it ahead of me but i made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left hand shore which meant that i was in a crossing so i changed off and went that way it was one of these long slanting two mile crossings so i was a good long time in getting over i made a safe landing and clumb up the bank i couldnt see but a little ways but i went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then i run across a big old fashioned double log house before i noticed it i was going to rush by and get away but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me and i knowed better than to move another peg chapter xvii in about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out and says be done boys whos there i says its me whos me george jackson sir what do you want i dont want nothing sir i only want to go along by but the dogs wont let me what are you prowling around here

open yourself just enough to squeeze ind you hear i didnt hurry i couldnt if id a wanted to i took one slow step at a time and there warnt a sound only i thought i could hear my heart the dogs were as still as the humans but they followed a little behind me when i got to the three log doorsteps i heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting i put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said there thats enough put your head in i done it but i judged they would take it off the candle was on the floor and there they all was looking at me and me at them for about a quarter of a minute three big men with guns pointed at me which made me wince i tell you the oldest gray and about sixty the other two thirty or more all of them fine and handsome and the sweetest old gray headed lady and back of her two young women which i couldnt see right well the old gentleman says there i reckon its all right come in as soon as i was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it and told the young men to come in with their guns and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows there warnt none on the side they held the candle and took a good look at me and all said why he aint a shepherdson no there aint any shepherdson about him then the old man said he hoped i wouldnt mind being searched for arms because he didnt mean no harm by it it was only to make sure so he didnt pry into my pockets but only felt outside with his hands and said it was all right he told me to make myself easy and at home and tell all about myself but the old lady says why bless you saul the poor things as wet as he can be and dont you reckon it may be hes hungry true for you rachel i forgot so the old lady says betsy this was a nigger woman you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can poor thing and one of you girls go and wake up buck and tell him oh here he is himself buck take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours thats dry buck looked about as old as me thirteen or fourteen or along there though he was a little bigger than me he hadnt on anything but a shirt and he was very frowzy headed he came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes and he was dragging a gun along with the other one he says aint they no shepherdsons around they said no twas a false alarm well he says if theyd a ben some i reckon id a got one they all laughed and bob says why buck they might have scalped us all you ve been so slow in coming well nobody come after me and it aint right im always kept down i dont get no show never mind buck my boy says the old man you ll have show

put them on while i was at it he asked me what my name was but before i could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday and he asked me where moses was when the candle went out i said i didnt know i hadnt heard about it before no way well guess he says howm i going to guess says i when i never heard tell of it before but you can guess cant you its just as easy which candle i says why any candle he says i dont know where he was says i where was he why he was in the dark thats where he was well if you knowed where he was what did you ask me for why blame it its a riddle dont you see say how long are you going to stay here you got to stay always we can just have booming times they dont have no school now do you own a dog i ve got a dog and he ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in do you like to comb up sundays and all that kind of foolishness you bet i dont but ma she makes me confound these ole britches i reckon id better put em on but id ruther not its so warm are you all ready all right come along old hoss cold corn pone cold corn beef butter and buttermilk that is what they had for me down there and there aint nothing better that ever i ve come across yet buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes except the nigger woman which was gone and the two young women they all smoked and talked and i eat and talked the young women had quilts around them and their hair down their backs they all asked me questions and i told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of arkansaw and my sister mary ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more and bill went to hunt them and he warnt heard of no more and tom and mort died and then there warnt nobody but just me and pap left and he was just trimmed down to nothing on account of his troubles so when he died i took what there was left because the farm didnt belong to us and started up the river deck passage and fell overboard and that was how i come to be here so they said i could have a home there as long as i wanted it then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed and i went to bed with buck and when i waked up in the morning drat it all i had forgot what my name was so i laid there about an hour trying to think and when buck waked up i says can you spell buck yes he says i bet you cant spell my name says i i bet you what you dare i can says he all right says i go ahead g e o r g e j a x o n there now he says well says i you done it but i didnt think you could it aint no slouch of a name to spell right off without studying i set it down private because somebody might want me to spell it next and so i wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like i was used to it it was a mighty nice family and a mighty nice house too i hadnt seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style it didnt have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden one with a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as houses in town there warnt no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them there was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick sometimes they wash them over with red water paint that they call spanish brown same as they do in town they had big brass dog irons that could hold up a saw log there was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front and a round place in the middle of it for the sun and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it it was beautiful to hear that clock tick and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out they wouldnt took any money for her well there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock made out of something like chalk and painted up gaudy by one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery and a crockery dog by the other and when you pressed down on them they squeaked but didnt open their mouths nor look different nor interested they squeaked through underneath there was a couple of big wild turkey wing fans spread out behind those things on the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is but they warnt real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk or whatever it was underneath this table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth with a red and blue spread eagle painted on it and a painted border all around it come all the way from philadelphia they said there was some books too piled up perfectly exact on each corner of the table one was a big family bible full of pictures one was pilgrims progress about a man that left his family it didnt say why i read considerable in it now and then the statements was interesting but tough another was friendships offering full of beautiful stuff and poetry but i didnt read the poetry another was henry clays speeches and another was dr gunns family medicine which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead there was a hymn book and a lot of other books and there was nice split bottom chairs and perfectly sound too not bagged down in the middle and busted like an old basket they had pictures hung on the walls mainly washingtons and lafayettes and battles and highland marys and one called signing the declaration there was some that they called crayons which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old they was different from any pictures i ever see before blacker mostly than is common one was a woman in a slim black dress belted small under the armpits with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves and a large black scoop shovel bonnet with a black veil and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape and very wee black slippers like a chisel and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow under a weeping willow and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule and underneath the picture it said shall i never see thee more alas another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair back and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up and underneath the picture it said i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas there was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon and tears running down her cheeks and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth and underneath the picture it said and art thou gone yes thou art gone alas these was all nice pictures i reckon but i didnt somehow seem to take to them because if ever i was down a little they always give me the fan tods everybody was sorry she died because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost but i reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard she was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done but she never got the chance it was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off with her hair all down her back and looking up to the moon with the tears running down her face and she had two arms folded across her breast and two arms stretched out in front and two more reaching up towards the moon and the idea was to see which pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arms but as i was saying she died before she got her mind made up and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it other times it was hid with a little curtain the young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery seemed to me this young girl kept a scrap book when she was alive and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the presbyterian observer and write poetry after them out of her own head it was very good poetry this is what she wrote about a boy by the name of stephen dowling bots that fell down a well and was drownded ode to stephen dowling bots decd and did young stephen sicken and did young stephen die and did the sad hearts thicken and did the mourners cry no such was not the fate of young stephen dowling bots though sad hearts round him thickened twas not from sickness shots no whooping cough did rack his frame nor measles drear with spots not these impaired the sacred name of stephen dowling bots despised love struck not with woe that head of curly knots nor stomach troubles laid him low young stephen dowling bots o no then list with tearful eye whilst i his fate do tell his soul did from this cold world fly by falling down a well they got him out and emptied him alas it was too late his spirit was gone for to sport aloft in the realms of the good and great if emmeline grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen there aint no telling what she could a done by and by buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing she didnt ever have to stop to think he said she would slap down a line and if she couldnt find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one and go ahead she warnt particular she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful every time a man died or a woman died or a child died she would be on hand with her tribute before he was cold she called them tributes the neighbors said it was the doctor first then emmeline then the undertaker the undertaker never got in ahead of emmeline but once and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead persons name which was whistler she warnt ever the same after that she never complained but she kinder pined away and did not live long poor thing manys the time i made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and i had soured on her a little i liked all that family dead ones and all and warnt going to let anything come between us poor emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive and it didnt seem right that there warnt nobody to make some about her now she was gone so i tried to sweat out a verse or two myself but i couldnt seem to make it go somehow they kept emmelines room trim and nice and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive and nobody ever slept there the old lady took care of the room herself though there was plenty of niggers and she sewed there a good deal and read her bible there mostly well as i was saying about the parlor there was beautiful curtains on the windows white with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls and cattle coming down to drink there was a little old piano too that had tin pans in it i reckon and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing the last link is broken and play the battle of prague on it the walls of all the rooms was plastered and most had carpets on the floors and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside it was a double house and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day and it was a cool comfortable place nothing couldnt be better and warnt the cooking good and just bushels of it too chapter xviii col grangerford was a gentleman you see he was a gentleman all over and so was his family he was well born as the saying is and thats worth as much in a man as it is in a horse so the widow douglas said and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town and pap he always said it too though he warnt no more quality than a mudcat himself col grangerford was very tall and very slim and had a darkish paly complexion not a sign of red in it anywheres he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face and he had the thinnest kind of lips and the thinnest kind of nostrils and a high nose and heavy eyebrows and the blackest kind of eyes sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you as you may say his forehead was high and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders his hands was long and thin and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it and on sundays he wore a blue tail coat with brass buttons on it he carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it there warnt no frivolishness about him not a bit and he warnt ever loud he was as kind as he could be you could feel that you know and so you had confidence sometimes he smiled and it was good to see but when he straightened himself up like a liberty pole and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows you wanted to climb a tree first and find out what the matter was afterwards he didnt ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners everybody was always good mannered where he was everybody loved to have him around too he was sunshine most always i mean he made it seem like good weather when he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute and that was enough there wouldnt nothing go wrong again for a week when him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good day and didnt set down again till they had set down then tom and bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him and he held it in his hand and waited till toms and bobs was mixed and then they bowed and said our duty to you sir and madam and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drank all three and bob and tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers and give it to me and buck and we drank to the old people too bob was the oldest and tom next tall beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces and long black hair and black eyes they dressed in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman and wore broad panama hats then there was miss charlotte she was twenty five and tall and proud and grand but as good as she could be when she warnt stirred up but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks like her father she was beautiful so was her sister miss sophia but it was a different kind she was gentle and sweet like a dove and she was only twenty each person had their own nigger to wait on them buck too my nigger had a monstrous easy time because i warnt used to having anybody do anything for me but bucks was on the jump most of the time this was all there was of the family now but there used to be more three sons they got killed and emmeline that died the old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers sometimes a stack of people would come there horseback from ten or fifteen mile around and stay five or six days and have such junketings round about and on the river and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes and balls at the house nights these people was mostly kinfolks of the family the men brought their guns with them it was a handsome lot of quality i tell you there was another clan of aristocracy around there five or six families mostly of the name of shepherdson they was as high toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerfords the shepherdsons and grangerfords used the same steamboat landing which was about two mile above our house so sometimes when i went up there with a lot of our folks i used to see a lot of the shepherdsons there on their fine horses one day buck and me was away out in the woods hunting and heard a horse coming we was crossing the road buck says quick jump for the woods we done it and then peeped down the woods through the leaves pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier he had his gun across his pommel i had seen him before it was young harney shepherdson i heard bucks gun go off at my ear and harneys hat tumbled off from his head he grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid but we didnt wait we started through the woods on a run the woods warnt thick so i looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet and twice i seen harney cover buck with his gun and then he rode away the way he come to get his hat i reckon but i couldnt see we never stopped running till we got home the old gentlemans eyes blazed a minute twas pleasure mainly i judged then his face sort of smoothed down and he says kind of gentle i dont like that shooting from behind a bush why didnt you step into the road my boy the shepherdsons dont father they always take advantage miss charlotte she held her head up like a queen while buck was telling his tale and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped the two young men looked dark but never said nothing miss sophia she turned pale but the color come back when she found the man warnt hurt soon as i could get buck down by the corn cribs under the trees by ourselves i says did you want to kill him buck well i bet i did what did he do to you him he never done nothing to me well then what did you want to kill him for why nothing only its on account of the feud whats a feud why where was you raised dont you know what a feud is never heard of it before tell me about it well says buck a feud is this way a man has a quarrel with another man and kills him then that other mans brother kills him then the other brothers on both sides goes for one another then the cousins chip in and by and by everybodys killed off and there aint no more feud but its kind of slow and takes a long time has this one been going on long buck well i should reckon it started thirty year ago or som ers along there there was trouble bout something and then a lawsuit to settle it and the suit went agin one of the men and so he up and shot the man that won the suit which he would naturally do of course anybody would what was the trouble about buck land i reckon maybe i dont know well who done the shooting was it a grangerford or a shepherdson laws how do i know it was so long ago dont anybody know oh yes pa knows i reckon and some of the other old people but they dont know now what the row was about in the first place has there been many killed buck yes right smart chance of funerals but they dont always kill pas got a few buckshot in him but he dont mind it cuz he dont weigh much anyway bobs been carved up some with a bowie and toms been hurt once or twice has anybody been killed this year buck yes we got one and they got one bout three months ago my cousin bud fourteen year old was riding through the woods on t other side of the river and didnt have no weapon with him which was blame foolishness and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a coming behind him and sees old baldy shepherdson a linkin after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a flying in the wind and stead of jumping off and taking to the brush bud lowed he could out run him so they had it nip and tuck for five mile or more the old man a gaining all the time so at last bud seen it warnt any use so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front you know and the old man he rode up and shot him down but he didnt git much chance to enjoy his luck for inside of a week our folks laid him out i reckon that old man was a coward buck i reckon he warnt a coward not by a blame sight there aint a coward amongst them shepherdsons not a one and there aint no cowards amongst the grangerfords either why that old man kep up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three grangerfords and come out winner they was all a horseback he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile and kep his horse before him to stop the bullets but the grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man and peppered away at him and he peppered away at them him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled but the grangerfords had to be fetched home and one of em was dead and another died the next day no sir if a bodys out hunting for cowards he dont want to fool away any time amongst them shepherdsons becuz they dont breed any of that kind next sunday we all went to church about three mile everybody a horseback the men took their guns along so did buck and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall the shepherdsons done the same it was pretty ornery preaching all about brotherly love and such like tiresomeness but everybody said it was a good sermon and they all talked it over going home and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination and i dont know what all that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest sundays i had run across yet about an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around some in their chairs and some in their rooms and it got to be pretty dull buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep i went up to our room and judged i would take a nap myself i found that sweet miss sophia standing in her door which was next to ours and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft and asked me if i liked her and i said i did and she asked me if i would do something for her and not tell anybody and i said i would then she said shed forgot her testament and left it in the seat at church between two other books and would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not say nothing to nobody i said i would so i slid out and slipped off up the road and there warnt anybody at the church except maybe a hog or two for there warnt any lock on the door and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer time because its cool if you notice most folks dont go to church only when they ve got to but a hog is different says i to myself somethings up it aint natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a testament so i give it a shake and out drops a little piece of paper with half past two wrote on it with a pencil i ransacked it but couldnt find anything else i couldnt make anything out of that so i put the paper in the book again and when i got home and upstairs there was miss sophia in her door waiting for me she pulled me in and shut the door then she looked in the testament till she found the paper and as soon as she read it she looked glad and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze and said i was the best boy in the world and not to tell anybody she was mighty red in the face for a minute and her eyes lighted up and it made her powerful pretty i was a good deal astonished but when i got my breath i asked her what the paper was about and she asked me if i had read it and i said no and she asked me if i could read writing and i told her no only coarse hand and then she said the paper warnt anything but a book mark to keep her place and i might go and play now i went off down to the river studying over this thing and pretty soon i noticed that my nigger was following along behind when we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second and then comes a running and says mars jawge if you ll come down into de swamp i ll show you a whole stack o water moccasins thinks i thats mighty curious he said that yesterday he oughter know a body dont love water moccasins enough to go around hunting for them what is he up to anyway so i says all right trot ahead i followed a half a mile then he struck out over the swamp and waded ankle deep as much as another half mile we come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines and he says you shove right in dah jist a few steps mars jawge dahs whah dey is is seedm befo i dont k yer to see em no mo then he slopped right along and went away and pretty soon the trees hid him i poked into the place a ways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines and found a man laying there asleep and by jings it was my old jim i waked him up and i reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again but it warnt he nearly cried he was so glad but he warnt surprised said he swum along behind me that night and heard me yell every time but dasnt answer because he didnt want nobody to pick him up and take

i could put by and by i begin to hear guns a good ways off when i come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands i worked along under the trees and brush till i got to a good place and then i clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach and watched there was a wood rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree and first i was going to hide behind that but maybe it was luckier i didnt there was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store cussing and yelling and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood rank alongside of the steamboat landing but they couldnt come it every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at the two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile so they could watch both ways by and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling they started riding towards the store then up gets one of the boys draws a steady bead over the wood rank and drops one of them out of his saddle all the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store and that minute the two boys started on the run they got half way to the tree i was in before the men noticed then the men see them and jumped on their horses and took out after them they gained on the boys but it didnt do no good the boys had too good a start they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree and slipped in behind it and so they had the bulge on the men again one of the boys was buck and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old the men ripped around awhile and then rode away as soon as they was out of sight i sung out to buck and told him he didnt know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first he was awful surprised he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again said they was up to some devilment or other wouldnt be gone long i wished i was out of that tree but i dasnt come down buck begun to cry and rip and lowed that him and his cousin joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet he said his father and his two brothers was killed and two or three of the enemy said the shepherdsons laid for them in ambush buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations the shepherdsons was too strong for them i asked him what was become of young harney and miss sophia he said theyd got across the river and was safe i was glad of that but the way buck did take on because he didnt manage to kill harney that day he shot at him i haint ever heard anything like it all of a sudden bang bang bang goes three or four guns the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses the boys jumped for the river both of them hurt and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out kill them kill them it made me so sick i most fell out of the tree i aint a going to tell all that happened it would make me sick again if i was to do that i wished i hadnt ever come ashore that night to see such things i aint ever going to get shut of them lots of times i dream about them i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come down sometimes i heard guns away off in the woods and twice i seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns so i reckoned the trouble was still a going on i was mighty downhearted so i made up my mind i wouldnt ever go anear that house again because i reckoned i was to blame somehow i judged that that piece of paper meant that miss sophia was to meet harney somewheres at half past two and run off and i judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful mess wouldnt ever happened when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a piece and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water and tugged at them till i got them ashore then i covered up their faces and got away as quick as i could i cried a little when i was covering up bucks face for he was mighty good to me it was just dark now i never went near the house but struck through the woods and made for the swamp jim warnt on his island so i tramped off in a hurry for the crick and crowded through the willows red hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country the raft was gone my souls but i was scared i couldnt get my breath for most a minute then i raised a yell a voice not twenty five foot from me says good lan is dat you honey doan make no noise it was jims voice nothing ever sounded so good before i run along the bank a piece and got aboard and jim he grabbed me and hugged me he was so glad to see me he says laws bless you chile i uz right down sho yous dead agin jacks been heah he say he reckn yous ben shot kase you didn come home no mo so is jes dis minute a startin de raf down towards de mouf er de crick sos to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as jack comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead lawsy is mighty glad to git you back again honey i says all right thats mighty good they wont find me and they ll think i ve been killed and floated down the river theres something up there that ll help them think so so dont you lose no time jim but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can i never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the mississippi then we hung up our signal lantern and judged that we was free and safe once more i hadnt had a bite to eat since yesterday so jim he got out some corn dodgers and buttermilk and pork and cabbage and greens there aint nothing in the world so good when its cooked right and whilst i eat my supper we talked and had a good time i was powerful glad to get away from the feuds and so was jim to get away from the swamp we said there warnt no home like a raft after all other places do seem so cramped up and smothery but a raft dont you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft chapter xix two or three days and nights went by i reckon i might say they swum by they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely here is the way we put in the time it was a monstrous big river down there sometimes a mile and a half wide we run nights and laid up and hid daytimes soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up nearly always in the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwoods and willows and hid the raft with them then we set out the lines next we slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cool off then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep and watched the daylight come not a sound anywheres perfectly still just like the whole world was asleep only sometimes the bullfrogs a cluttering maybe the first thing to see looking away over the water was a kind of dull line that was the woods on t other side you couldnt make nothing else out then a pale place in the sky then more paleness spreading around then the river softened up away off and warnt black any more but gray you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away trading scows and such things and long black streaks rafts sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking or jumbled up voices it was so still and sounds come so far and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that theres a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way and you see the mist curl up off of the water and the east reddens up and the river and you make out a log cabin in the edge of the woods away on the bank on t other side of the river being a woodyard likely and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres then the nice breeze springs up and comes fanning you from over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers but sometimes not that way because they ve left dead fish laying around gars and such and they do get pretty rank and next you ve got the full day and everything smiling in the sun and the song birds just going it a little smoke couldnt be noticed now so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast and afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river and kind of lazy along and by and by lazy off to sleep wake up by and by and look to see what done it and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up stream so far off towards the other side you couldnt tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern wheel or side wheel then for about an hour there wouldnt be nothing to hear nor nothing to see just solid lonesomeness next youd see a raft sliding by away off yonder and maybe a galoot on it chopping because they re most always doing it on a raft youd see the axe flash and come down you dont hear nothing you see that axe go up again and by the time its above the mans head then you hear the k chunk it had took all that time to come over the water so we would put in the day lazying around listening to the stillness once there was a thick fog and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldnt run over them a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing heard them plain but we couldnt see no sign of them it made you feel crawly it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air jim said he believed it was spirits but i says no spirits wouldnt say dern the dern fog soon as it was night out we shoved when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone and let her float wherever the current wanted her to then we lit the pipes and dangled our legs in the water and talked about all kinds of things we was always naked day and night whenever the mosquitoes would let us the new clothes bucks folks made for me was too good to be comfortable and besides i didnt go much on clothes nohow sometimes wed have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time yonder was the banks and the islands across the water and maybe a spark which was a candle in a cabin window and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two on a raft or a scow you know and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts its lovely to live on a raft we had the sky up there all speckled with stars and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened jim he allowed they was made but i allowed they happened i judged it would have took too long to make so many jim said the moon could a laid them well that looked kind of reasonable so i didnt say nothing against it because i ve seen a frog lay most as many so of course it could be done we used to watch the stars that fell too and see them streak down jim allowed theyd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again and by and by her waves would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggle the raft a bit and after that you wouldnt hear nothing for you couldnt tell how long except maybe frogs or something after midnight the people on shore went to bed and then for two or three hours the shores was black no more sparks in the cabin windows these sparks was our clock the first one that showed again meant morning was coming so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away one morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore it was only two hundred yards and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods to see if i couldnt get some berries just as i was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it i thought i was a goner for whenever anybody was after anybody i judged it was me or maybe jim i was about to dig out from there in a hurry but they was pretty close to me then and sung out and begged me to save their lives said they hadnt been doing nothing and was being chased for it said there was men and dogs a coming they wanted to jump right in but i says dont you do it i dont hear the dogs and horses yet you ve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in that ll throw the dogs off the scent they done it and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towhead and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off shouting we heard them come along towards the crick but couldnt see them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we got further and further away all the time we couldnt hardly hear them at all by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe one of these fellows was about seventy or upwards and had a bald head and very gray whiskers he had an old battered up slouch hat on and a greasy blue woollen shirt and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot tops and home knit galluses no he only had one he had an old long tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm and both of them had big fat ratty looking carpet bags the other fellow was about thirty and dressed about as ornery after breakfast we all laid off and talked and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didnt know one another what got you into trouble says the baldhead to t other chap well id been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth and it does take it off too and generly the enamel along with it but i stayed about one night longer than i ought to and was just in the act of sliding out when i ran across you on the trail this side of town and you told me they were coming and begged me to help you to get off so i told you i was expecting trouble myself and

i kn tell a fortune pretty good when i ve got somebody along to find out the facts for me preachins my line too and workin camp meetins and missionaryin around nobody never said anything for a while then the young man hove a sigh and says alas what re you alassin about says the bald head to think i should have lived to be leading such a life and be degraded down into such company and he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag dern your skin aint the company good enough for you says the baldhead pretty pert and uppish yes it is good enough for me its as good as i deserve for who fetched me so low when i was so high i did myself i dont blame you gentlemen far from it i dont blame anybody i deserve it all let the cold world do its worst one thing i know theres a grave somewhere for me the world may go on just as its always done and take everything from me loved ones property everything but it cant take that some day i ll lie down in it and forget it all and my poor broken heart will be at rest he went on a wiping drot your pore broken heart says the baldhead what are you heaving your pore broken heart at usf r we haint done nothing no i know you havent i aint blaming you gentlemen i brought myself down yes i did it myself its right i should suffer perfectly right i dont make any moan brought you down from whar whar was you brought down from ah you would not believe me the world never believes let it pass tis no matter the secret of my birth the secret of your birth do you mean to say gentlemen says the young man very solemn i will reveal it to you for i feel i may have confidence in you by rights i am a duke jims eyes bugged out when he heard that and i reckon mine did too then the baldhead says no you cant mean it yes my great grandfather eldest son of the duke of bridgewater fled to this country about the end of the last century to breathe the pure air of freedom married here and died leaving a son his own father dying about the same time the second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates the infant real duke was ignored i am the lineal descendant of that infant i am the rightful duke of bridgewater and here am i forlorn torn from my high estate hunted of men despised by the cold world ragged worn heart broken and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft jim pitied him ever so much and so did i we tried to comfort him but he said it warnt much use he couldnt be much comforted said if we was a mind to acknowledge him that would do him more good than most anything else so we said we would if he would tell us how he said we ought to bow when we spoke to him and say your grace or my lord or your lordship and he wouldnt mind it if we called him plain bridgewater which he said was a title anyway and not a name and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner and do any little thing for him he wanted done well that was all easy so we done it all through dinner jim stood around and waited on him and says will yo grace have some o dis or some o dat and so on and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him but the old man got pretty silent by and by didnt have much to say and didnt look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke he seemed to have something on his mind so along in the afternoon he says looky here bilgewater he says im nation sorry for you but you aint the only person thats had troubles like that no no you aint you aint the only person thats ben snaked down wrongfully outn a high place alas no you aint the only person thats had a secret of his birth and by jings he begins to cry hold what do you mean bilgewater kin i trust you says the old man still sort of sobbing to the bitter death he took the old man by the hand and squeezed it and says that secret of your being speak bilgewater i am the late dauphin you bet you jim and me stared this time then the duke says you are what yes my friend it is too true your eyes is lookin at this very moment on the pore disappeared dauphin looy the seventeen son of looy the sixteen and marry antonette you at your age no you mean you re the late charlemagne you must be six or seven hundred years old at the very least trouble has done it bilgewater trouble has done it trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude yes gentlemen you see before you in blue jeans and misery the wanderin exiled trampled on and sufferin rightful king of france well he cried and took on so that me and jim didnt know hardly what to do we was so sorry and so glad and proud wed got him with us too so we set in like we done before with the duke and tried to comfort him but he said it warnt no use nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights and got down on one knee to speak to him and always called him your majesty and waited on him first at meals and didnt set down in his presence till he asked them so jim and me set to majestying him and doing this and that and t other for him and standing up till he told us we might set down this done him heaps of good and so he got cheerful and comfortable but the duke kind of soured on him and didnt look a bit satisfied with the way things was going still the king acted real friendly towards him and said the dukes great grandfather and all the other dukes of bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father and was allowed to come to the palace considerable but the duke stayed huffy a good while till by and by the king says like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h yer raft bilgewater and so whats the use o your bein sour it ll only make things oncomfortable it aint my fault i warnt born a duke it aint your fault you warnt born a king so whats the use to worry make the best o things the way you find em says i thats my motto this aint no bad thing that we ve struck here plenty grub and an easy life come give us your hand duke and les all be friends the duke done it and jim and me was pretty glad to see it it took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft for what you want above all things on a raft is for everybody to be satisfied and feel right and kind towards the others it didnt take me long to make up my mind that these liars warnt no kings nor dukes at all but just low down humbugs and frauds but i never said nothing never let on kept it to myself its the best way then you dont have no quarrels and dont get into no trouble if they wanted us to call them kings and dukes i hadnt no objections long as it would keep peace in the family and it warnt no use to tell jim so i didnt tell him if i never learnt nothing else out of pap i learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way chapter xx they asked us considerable many questions wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for and laid by in the daytime instead of running was jim a runaway nigger says i goodness sakes would a runaway nigger run south no they allowed he wouldnt i had to account for things some way so i says my folks was living in pike county in missouri where i was born and they all died off but me and pa and my brother ike pa he lowed hed break up and go down and live with uncle ben whos got a little one horse place on the river forty four mile below orleans pa was pretty poor and had some debts so when hed squared up there warnt nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger jim that warnt enough to take us fourteen hundred mile deck passage nor no other way well when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day he ketched this piece of a raft so we reckoned wed go down to orleans on it pas luck didnt hold out a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel jim and me come up all right but pa was drunk and ike was only four years old so they never come up no more well for the next day or two we had considerable trouble because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take jim away from me saying they believed he was a runaway nigger we dont run daytimes no more now nights they dont bother us the duke says leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to i ll think the thing over i ll invent a plan that ll fix it we ll let it alone for to day because of course we dont want to go by that town yonder in daylight it mightnt be healthy towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky and the leaves was beginning to shiver it was going to be pretty ugly it was easy to see that so the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam to see what the beds was like my bed was a straw tick better than jims which was a corn shuck tick theres always cobs around about in a shuck tick and they poke into you and hurt and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves it makes such a rustling that you wake up well the duke allowed he would take my bed but the king allowed he wouldnt he says i should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn shuck bed warnt just fitten for me to sleep on your grace ll take the shuck bed yourself jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them so we was pretty glad when the duke says tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit i yield i submit tis my fate i am alone in the world let me suffer can bear it we got away as soon as it was good and dark the king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town we come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by that was the town you know and slid by about a half a mile out all right when we was three quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern and about ten o clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night it was my watch below till twelve but i wouldnt a turned in anyway if id had a bed because a body dont see such a storm as that every day in the week not by a long sight my souls how the wind did scream along and every second or two thered come a glare that lit up the white caps for a half a mile around and youd see the islands looking dusty through the rain and the trees thrashing around in the wind then comes a h whack bum bum bumble umble um bum bum bum bum and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away and quit and then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager the waves most washed me off the raft sometimes but i hadnt any clothes on and didnt mind we didnt have no trouble about snags the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them i had the middle watch you know but i was pretty sleepy by that time so jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me he was always mighty good that way jim was i crawled into the wigwam but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warnt no show for me so i laid outside i didnt mind the rain because it was warm and the waves warnt running so high now about two they come up again though and jim was going to call me but he changed his mind because he reckoned they warnt high enough yet to do any harm but he was mistaken about that for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard it most killed jim a laughing he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anyway i took the watch and jim he laid down and snored away and by and by the storm let up for good and all and the first cabin light that showed i rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day the king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast and him and the duke played seven up a while five cents a game then they got tired of it and allowed they would lay out a campaign as they called it the duke went down into his carpet bag and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud one bill said the celebrated dr armand de montalban of paris would lecture on the science of phrenology at such and such a place on the blank day of blank at ten cents admission and furnish charts of character at twenty five cents apiece the duke said that was him in another bill he was the world renowned shakespearian tragedian garrick the younger of drury lane london in other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things like finding water and gold with a divining rod dissipating witch spells and so on by and by he says but the histrionic muse is the darling have you ever trod the boards royalty no says the king you shall then before you re three days older fallen grandeur says the duke the first good town we come to we ll hire a hall and do the sword fight in richard iii and the balcony scene in romeo and juliet how does that strike you im in up to the hub for anything that will pay bilgewater but you see i dont know nothing about play actin and haint ever seen much of it i was too small when pap used to have em at the palace do you reckon you can learn me easy all right im jist a freezn for something fresh anyway les commence right away so the duke he told him all about who romeo was and who juliet was and said he was used to being romeo so the king could be juliet but if juliets such a young gal duke my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin to look oncommon odd on her maybe no dont you worry these country jakes wont ever think of that besides you know you ll be in costume and that makes all the difference in the world juliets in a balcony enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed and shes got on her night gown and her ruffled nightcap here are the costumes for the parts he got out two or three curtain calico suits which he said was meedyevil armor for richard iii and t other chap and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match the king was satisfied so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread eagle way prancing around and acting at the same time to show how it had got to be done then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart there was a little one horse town about three mile down the bend and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for jim so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing the king allowed he would go too and see if he couldnt strike something we was out of coffee so jim said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some when we got there there warnt nobody stirring streets empty and perfectly dead and still like sunday we found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard and he said everybody that warnt too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp meeting about two mile back in the woods the king got the directions and allowed hed go and work that camp meeting for all it was worth and i might go too the duke said what he was after was a printing office we found it a little bit of a concern up over a carpenter shop carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting and no doors locked it was a dirty littered up place and had ink marks and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them all over the walls the duke shed his coat and said he was all right now so me and the king lit out for the camp meeting we got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping for it was a most awful hot day there was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around the woods was full of teams and wagons hitched everywheres feeding out of the wagon troughs and stomping to keep off the flies there was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell and piles of watermelons and green corn and such like truck the preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds only they was bigger and held crowds of people the benches was made out of outside slabs of logs with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs they didnt have no backs the preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds the women had on sun bonnets and some had linsey woolsey frocks some gingham ones and a few of the young ones had on calico some of the young men was barefooted and some of the children didnt have on any clothes but just a tow linen shirt some of the old women was knitting and some of the young folks was courting on the sly the first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn he lined out two lines everybody sung it and it was kind of grand to hear it there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way then he lined out two more for them to sing and so on the people woke up more and more and sung louder and louder and towards the end some begun to groan and some begun to shout then the preacher begun to preach and begun in earnest too and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other and then a leaning down over the front of it with his arms and his body going all the time and shouting his words out with all his might and every now and then he would hold up his bible and spread it open and kind of pass it around this way and that shouting its the brazen serpent in the wilderness look upon it and live and people would shout out glory a a men and so he went on and the people groaning and crying and saying amen oh come to the mourners bench come black with sin amen come sick and sore amen come lame and halt and blind amen come pore and needy sunk in shame a a men come all thats worn and soiled and suffering come with a broken spirit come with a contrite heart come in your rags and sin and dirt the waters that cleanse is free the door of heaven stands open oh enter in and be at rest a a men glory glory hallelujah and so on you couldnt make out what the preacher said any more on account of the shouting and crying folks got up everywheres in the crowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners bench with the tears running down their faces and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wild well the first i knowed the king got a going and you could hear him over everybody and next he went a charging up on to the platform and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people and he done it he told them he was a pirate been a pirate for thirty years out in the indian ocean and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight and he was home now to take out some fresh men and thanks to goodness hed been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent and he was glad of it it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him because he was a changed man now and happy for the first time in his life and poor as he was he was going to start right off and work his way back to the indian ocean and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path for he could do it better than anybody else being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean and though it would take him a long time to get there without money he would get there anyway and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him dont you thank me dont you give me no credit it all belongs to them dear people in pokeville camp meeting natural brothers and benefactors of the race and that dear preacher there the truest friend a pirate ever had and then he busted into tears and so did everybody then somebody sings out take up a collection for him take up a collection well a half a dozen made a jump to do it but somebody sings out let him pass the hat around then everybody said it the preacher too so the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there and every little while the prettiest kind of girls with the tears running down their cheeks would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by and he always done it and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times and he was invited to stay a week and everybody wanted him to live in their houses and said theyd think it was an honor but he said as this was the last day of the camp meeting he couldnt do no good and besides he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go to work on the pirates when we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty seven dollars and seventy five cents and then he had fetched away a three gallon jug of whisky too that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods the king said take it all around it laid over any day hed ever put in in the missionarying line he said it warnt no use talking heathens dont amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp meeting with the duke was thinking hed been doing pretty well till the king come to show up but after that he didnt think so so much he had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing office horse bills and took the money four dollars and he had got in ten dollars worth of advertisements for the paper which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance so they done it the price of the paper was two dollars a year but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it and was going to run it for cash he set up a little piece of poetry which he made himself out of his own head three verses kind of sweet and saddish the name of it was yes crush cold world this breaking heart and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper and didnt charge nothing for it well he took in nine dollars and a half and said hed done a pretty square days work for it then he showed us another little job hed printed and hadnt charged for because it was for us it had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder and reward under it the reading was all about jim and just described him to a dot it said he run away from st jacques plantation forty mile below new orleans last winter and likely went north and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses now says the duke after to night we can run in the daytime if we want to whenever we see anybody coming we can tie jim hand and foot with a rope and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river and were too poor to travel on a steamboat so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward handcuffs and chains would look still better on jim but it wouldnt go well with the story of us being so poor too much like jewelry ropes are the correct thing we must preserve the unities as we say on the boards we all said the duke was pretty smart and there couldnt be no trouble about running daytimes we judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the dukes work in the printing office was going to make in that little town then we could boom right along if we wanted to we laid low and kept still and never shoved out till nearly ten o clock then we slid by pretty wide away from the town and didnt hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it when jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning he says huck does you reckn we gwyne to run acrost any mo kings on dis trip no i says i reckon not well says he dats all right den i doan mine one er two kings but dats enough dis ones powerful drunk en de duke ain much better i found jim had been trying to get him to talk french so he could hear what it was like but he said he had been in this country so long and had so much trouble hed forgot it chapter xxi it was after sun up now but we went right on and didnt tie up the king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty but after theyd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal after breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches and let his legs dangle in the water so as to be comfortable and lit his pipe and went to getting his romeo and juliet by heart when he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together the duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech and he made him sigh and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he done it pretty well only he says you mustnt bellow out romeo that way like a bull you must say it soft and sick and languishy sor o o meo that is the idea for juliets a dear sweet mere child of a girl you know and she doesnt bray like a jackass well next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths and begun to practice the sword fight the duke called himself richard iii and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see but by and by the king tripped and fell overboard and after that they took a rest and had a talk about all kinds of adventures theyd had in other times along the river after dinner the duke says well capet we ll want to make this a first class show you know so i guess we ll add a little more to it we want a little something to answer encores with anyway whats onkores bilgewater the duke told him and then says i ll answer by doing the highland fling or the sailors hornpipe and you well let me see oh i ve got it you can do hamlets soliloquy hamlets which hamlets soliloquy you know the most celebrated thing in shakespeare ah its sublime sublime always fetches the house i havent got it in the book i ve only got one volume but i reckon i can piece it out from memory i ll just walk up and down a minute and see if i can call it back from recollections vaults so he went to marching up and down thinking and frowning horrible every now and then then he would hoist up his eyebrows next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan next he would sigh and next hed let on to drop a tear it was beautiful to see him by and by he got it he told us to give attention then he strikes a most noble attitude with one leg shoved forwards and his arms stretched away up and his head tilted back looking up at the sky and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth and after that all through his speech he howled and spread around and swelled up his chest and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever i see before this is the speech i learned it easy enough while he was learning it to the king to be or not to be that is the bare bodkin that makes calamity of so long life for who would fardels bear till birnam wood do come to dunsinane but that the fear of something after death murders the innocent sleep great natures second course and makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune than fly to others that we know not of theres the respect must give us pause wake duncan with thy knocking i would thou couldst for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the laws delay and the quietus which his pangs might take in the dead waste and middle of the night when churchyards yawn in customary suits of solemn black but that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns breathes forth contagion on the world and thus the native hue of resolution like the poor cat i the adage is sicklied o er with care and all the clouds that lowered o er our housetops with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action tis a consummation devoutly to be wished but soft you the fair ophelia ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws but get thee to a nunnery mdash go well the old man he liked that speech and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate it seemed like he was just born for it and when he had his hand in and was excited it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off the first chance we got the duke he had some show bills printed and after that for two or three days as we floated along the raft was a most uncommon lively place for there warnt nothing but sword fighting and rehearsing as the duke called it going on all the time one morning when we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw we come in sight of a little one horse town in a big bend so we tied up about three quarters of a mile above it in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees and all of us but jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show we struck it mighty lucky there was going to be a circus there that afternoon and the country people was already beginning to come in in all kinds of old shackly wagons and on horses the circus would leave before night so our show would have a pretty good chance the duke he hired the court house and we went around and stuck up our bills they read like this shaksperean revival wonderful attraction for one night only the world renowned tragedians david garrick the younger of drury lane theatre london and edmund kean the elder of the royal haymarket theatre whitechapel pudding lane piccadilly london and the royal continental theatres in their sublime shaksperean spectacle entitled the balcony scene in romeo and juliet romeo mr garrick juliet mr

richmond mr kean also by special request hamlets immortal soliloquy by the illustrious kean done by him consecutive nights in paris for one night only on account of imperative european engagements admission cents children and servants cents then we went loafing around the town the stores and houses was most all old shackly dried up frame concerns that hadnt ever been painted they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed the houses had little gardens around them but they didnt seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds and sunflowers and ash piles and old curled up boots and shoes and pieces of bottles and rags and played out tin ware the fences was made of different kinds of boards nailed on at different times and they leaned every which way and had gates that didnt generly have but one hinge a leather one some of the fences had been whitewashed some time or another but the duke said it was in clumbuss time like enough there was generly hogs in the garden and people driving them out all the stores was along one street they had white domestic awnings in front and the country people hitched their horses to the awning posts there was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings and loafers roosting on them all day long whittling them with their barlow knives and chawing tobacco and gaping and yawning and stretching a mighty ornery lot they generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella but didnt wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another bill and buck and hank and joe and andy and talked lazy and drawly and used considerable many cuss words there was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning post and he most always had his hands in his britches pockets except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch what a body was hearing amongst them all the time was gimme a chawv tobacker hank caint i haint got but one chaw left ask bill maybe bill he gives him a chaw maybe he lies and says he aint got none some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world nor a chaw of tobacco of their own they get all their chawing by borrowing they say to a fellow i wisht youd len me a chaw jack i jist this minute give ben thompson the last chaw i had which is a lie pretty much everytime it dont fool nobody but a stranger but jack aint no stranger so he says you give him a chaw did you so did your sisters cats grandmother you pay me back the chaws you ve awready borryd offn me lafe buckner then i ll loan you one or two ton of it and wont charge you no back intrust nuther well i did pay you back some of it wunst yes you did bout six chaws you borryd store tobacker and paid back nigger head store tobacco is flat black plug but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted when they borrow a chaw they dont generly cut it off with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when its handed back and says sarcastic here gimme the chaw and you take the plug all the streets and lanes was just mud they warnt nothing else but mud mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places and two or three inches deep in all the places the hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres youd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way where folks had to walk around her and shed stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look as happy as if she was on salary and pretty soon youd hear a loafer sing out hi so boy sick him tige and away the sow would go squealing most horrible with a dog or two swinging to each ear and three or four dozen more a coming and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise then theyd settle back again till there was a dog fight there couldnt anything wake them up all over and make them happy all over like a dog fight unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death on the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank and they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in the people had moved out of them the bank was caved away under one corner of some others and that corner was hanging over people lived in them yet but it was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer such a town as that has to be always moving back and back and back because the rivers always gnawing at it the nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets and more coming all the time families fetched their dinners with them from the country and eat them in the wagons there was considerable whisky drinking going on and i seen three fights by and by somebody sings out here comes old boggs in from the country for his little old monthly drunk here he comes boys all the loafers looked glad i reckoned they was used to having fun out of boggs one of them says wonder who hes a gwyne to chaw up this time if hed a chawed up all the men hes ben a gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year hed have considerable ruputation now another one says i wisht old boggsd threaten me cuz then id know i warnt gwyne to die for a thousan year boggs comes a tearing along on his horse whooping and yelling like an injun and singing out cler the track thar im on the waw path and the price uv coffins is a gwyne to raise he was drunk and weaving about in his saddle he was over fifty year old and had a very red face everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him and he sassed back and said hed attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns but he couldnt wait now because hed come to town to kill old colonel sherburn and his motto was meat first and spoon vittles to top off on he see me and rode up and says whard you come fm boy you prepared to die then he rode on i was scared but a man says he dont mean nothing hes always a carryin on like that when hes drunk hes the best naturedest old fool in arkansaw never hurt nobody drunk nor sober boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells come out here sherburn come out and meet the man you ve swindled you re the houn im after and im a gwyne to have you too and so he went on calling sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on by and by a proud looking man about fifty five and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town too steps out of the store and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come he says to boggs mighty cam and slow he says im tired of this but i ll endure it till one o clock till one o clock mind no longer if you open your mouth against me only once after that time you cant travel so far but i will find you then he turns and goes in the crowd looked mighty sober nobody stirred and there warnt no more laughing boggs rode off blackguarding sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the street and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store still keeping it up some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up but he wouldnt they told him it would be one o clock in about fifteen minutes and so he must go home he must go right away but it didnt do no good he cussed away with all his might and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it and pretty soon away he went a raging down the street again with his gray hair a flying everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober but it warnt no use up the street he would tear again and give sherburn another cussing by and by somebody says go for his daughter quick go for his daughter sometimes he ll listen to her if anybody can persuade him she can so somebody started on a run i walked down street a ways and stopped in about five or ten minutes here comes boggs again but not on his horse he was a reeling across the street towards me bare headed with a friend on both sides of him a holt of his arms and hurrying him along he was quiet and looked uneasy and he warnt hanging back any but was doing some of the hurrying himself somebody sings out boggs i looked over there to see who said it and it was that colonel sherburn he was standing perfectly still in the street and had a pistol raised in his right hand not aiming it but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky the same second i see a young girl coming on the run and two men with her boggs and the men turned round to see who called him and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side and the pistol barrel come down slow and steady to a level both barrels cocked boggs throws up both of his hands and says o lord dont shoot bang goes the first shot and he staggers back clawing at the air bang goes the second one and he tumbles backwards on to the ground heavy and solid with his arms spread out that young girl screamed out and comes rushing and down she throws herself on her father crying and saying oh hes killed him hes killed him the crowd closed up around them and shouldered and jammed one another with their necks stretched trying to see and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting back back give him air give him air colonel sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground and turned around on his heels and walked off they took boggs to a little drug store the crowd pressing around just the same and the whole town following and i rushed and got a good place at the window where i was close to him and could see in they laid him on the floor and put one large bible under his head and opened another one and spread it on his breast but they tore open his shirt first and i seen where one of the bullets went in he made about a dozen long gasps his breast lifting the bible up when he drawed in his breath and letting it down again when he breathed it out and after that he laid still he was dead then they pulled his daughter away from him screaming and crying and took her off she was about sixteen and very sweet and gentle looking but awful pale and scared well pretty soon the whole town was there squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look but people that had the places wouldnt give them up and folks behind them was saying all the time say now you ve looked enough you fellows taint right and taint fair for you to stay thar all the time and never give nobody a chance other folks has their rights as well as you there was considerable jawing back so i slid out thinking maybe there was going to be trouble the streets was full and everybody was excited everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows stretching their necks and listening one long lanky man with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and a crooked handled cane marked out the places on the ground where boggs stood and where sherburn stood and the people following him around from one place to t other and watching everything he done and bobbing their heads to show they understood and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn had stood frowning and having his hat brim down over his eyes and sung out boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and says bang staggered backwards says bang again and fell down flat on his back the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect said it was just exactly the way it all happened then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him well by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be lynched in about a minute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling and snatching down every clothes line they come to to do the hanging with chapter xxii they swarmed up towards sherburns house a whooping and raging like injuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush and it was awful to see children was heeling it ahead of the mob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window along the road was full of womens heads and there was nigger boys in every tree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on scared most to death they swarmed up in front of sherburns palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldnt hear yourself think for the noise it was a little twenty foot yard some sung out tear down the fence tear down the fence then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch with a double barrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectly cam and deliberate not saying a word the racket stopped and the wave sucked back sherburn never said a word just stood there looking down the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him but they couldnt they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasant kind but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread thats got sand in it then he says slow and scornful the idea of you lynching anybody its amusing the idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man because you re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast out women that come along here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man why a mans safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind as long as its daytime and you re not behind him do i know you i know you clear through i was born and raised in the south and i ve lived in the north so i know the average all around the average mans a coward in the north he lets anybody walk over him that wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it in the south one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime and robbed the lot your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people whereas you re just as brave and no braver why dont your juries hang murderers because they re afraid the mans friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and its just what they would do so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal your mistake is that you didnt bring a man with you thats one mistake and the other is that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks you brought part of a man buck harkness there and if you hadnt had him to start you youd a taken it out in blowing you didnt want to come the average man dont like trouble and danger you dont like trouble and danger but if only half a man like buck harkness there shouts lynch him lynch him you re afraid to back down afraid you ll be found out to be what you are cowards and so you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to that half a mans coat tail and come raging up here swearing what big things you re going to do the pitifulest thing out is a mob thats what an army is a mob they dont fight with courage thats born in them but with courage thats borrowed from their mass and from their officers but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole if any real lynchings going to be done it will be done in the dark southern fashion and when they come they ll bring their masks and fetch a man along now leave and take your half a man with you tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap i could a stayed if i wanted to but i didnt want to i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by and then dived in under the tent i had my twenty dollar gold piece and some other money but i reckoned i better save it because there aint no telling how soon you are going to need it away from home and amongst strangers that way you cant be too careful i aint opposed to spending money on circuses when there aint no other way but there aint no use in wasting it on them it was a real bully circus it was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady side by side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoes nor stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable there must a been twenty of them and every lady with a lovely complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gang of real sure enough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars and just littered with diamonds it was a powerful fine sight i never see anything so lovely and then one by one they got up and stood and went a weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight with their heads bobbing and skimming along away up there under the tent roof and every ladys rose leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips and she looking like the most loveliest parasol and then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first one foot out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more and more and the ringmaster going round and round the center pole cracking his whip and shouting hi hi and the clown cracking jokes behind him and by and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then scampered out and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild well all through the circus they done the most astonishing things and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people the ringmaster couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he ever could think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what i couldnt noway understand why i couldnt a thought of them in a year and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring said he wanted to ride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole show come to a standstill then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that stirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring saying knock him down throw him out and one or two women begun to scream so then the ringmaster he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldnt be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldnt make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse so everybody laughed and said all right and the man got on the minute he was on the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and the drunk man hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air every jump and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down and at last sure enough all the circus men could do the horse broke loose and away he went like the very nation round and round the ring with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side and then t other one on t other side and the people just crazy it warnt funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle a reeling this way and that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood and the horse a going like a house afire too he just stood up there a sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warnt ever drunk in his life and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits and then there he was slim and handsome and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum and finally skipped off and made his bow and danced off to the dressing room and everybody just a howling with pleasure and astonishment then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he was the sickest ringmaster you ever see i reckon why it was one of his own men he had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldnt a been in that ringmasters place not for a thousand dollars i dont know there may be bullier circuses than what that one was but i never struck them yet anyways it was plenty good enough for me and wherever i run across it it can have all of my custom every time well that night we had our show but there warnt only about twelve people there just enough to pay expenses and they laughed all the time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the show was over but one boy which was asleep so the duke said these arkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to shakespeare what they wanted was low comedy and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he reckoned he said he could size their style so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off some handbills and stuck them up all over the village the bills said chapter xxiii well all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the house was jam full of men in no time when the place couldnt hold no more the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech and praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was and so he went on a bragging about the tragedy and about edmund kean the elder which was to play the main principal part in it and at last when hed got everybodys expectations up high enough he rolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come a prancing out on all fours naked and he was painted all over ring streaked and striped all sorts of colors as splendid as a rainbow and but never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hawed till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time well it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut then the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more on accounts of pressing london engagements where the seats is all sold already for it in drury lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it twenty people sings out what is it over is that all the duke says yes then there was a fine time everybody sings out sold and rose up mad and was a going for that stage and them tragedians but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen we are sold mighty badly sold but we dont want to be the laughing stock of this whole town i reckon and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live no what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town then we ll all be in the same boat aint that sensible you bet it is the jedge is right everybody sings out all right then not a word about any sell go along home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy next day you couldnt hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was house was jammed again that night and we sold this crowd the same way when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper and by and by about midnight they made jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town the third night the house was crammed again and they warnt new comers this time but people that was at the show the other two nights i stood by the duke at the door and i see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coat and i see it warnt no perfumery neither not by a long sight i smelt sickly eggs by the barrel and rotten cabbages and such things and if i know the signs of a dead cat being around and i bet i do there was sixty four of them went in i shoved in there for a minute but it was too various for me i couldnt stand it well when the place couldnt hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute and then he started around for the stage door i after him but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says walk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you i done it and he done the same we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam and says well howd the old thing pan out this time duke he hadnt been up town at all we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village then we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way theyd served them people the duke says greenhorns flatheads i knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in and i knew theyd lay for us the third night and consider it was their turn now well it is their turn and id give something to know how much theyd take for it i would just like to know how they re putting in their opportunity they can turn it into a picnic if they want to they brought plenty provisions them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty five dollars in that three nights i never see money hauled in by the wagon load like that before by and by when they was asleep and snoring jim says dont it s prise you de way dem kings carries on huck no i says it dont why dont it huck well it dont because its in the breed i reckon they re all alike but huck dese kings o ourn is reglar rapscallions dats jist what dey is deys reglar rapscallions well thats what im a saying all kings is mostly rapscallions as fur as i can make out is dat so you read about them once you ll see look at henry the eight thisn s a sunday school superintendent to him and look at charles second and louis fourteen and louis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all them saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise cain my you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom he was a blossom he used to marry a new wife every day and chop off her head next morning and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs fetch up nell gwynn he says they fetch her up next morning chop off her head and they chop it off fetch up jane shore he says and up she comes next morning chop off her head and they chop it off ring up fair rosamun fair rosamun answers the bell next morning chop off her head and he made every one of them tell him a tale every night and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way and then he put them all in a book and called it domesday book which was a good name and stated the case you dont know kings jim but i know them and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest i ve struck in history well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country how does he go at it give notice give the country a show no all of a sudden he heaves all the tea in boston harbor overboard and whacks out a declaration of independence and dares them to come on that was his style he never give anybody a chance he had suspicions of his father the duke of wellington well what did he do ask him to show up no drownded him in a butt of mamsey like a cats pose people left money laying around where he was what did he do he collared it s pose he contracted to do a thing and you paid him and didnt set down there and see that he done it what did he do he always done the other things pose he opened his mouth what then if he didnt shut it up powerful quick hed lose a lie every time thats the kind of a bug henry was and if wed a had him along stead of our kings hed a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done i dont say that ourn is lambs because they aint when you come right down to the cold facts but they aint nothing to that old ram anyway all i say is kings is kings and you got to make allowances take them all around they re a mighty ornery lot its the way they re raised but dis one do smell so like de nation huck well they all do jim we cant help the way a king smells history dont tell no way now de duke hes a tolerble likely man in some ways yes a dukes different but not very different this ones a middling hard lot for a duke when hes drunk there aint no near sighted man could tell him from a king well anyways i doan hanker for no mo un um huck dese is all i kin stan its the way i feel too jim but we ve got them on our hands and we got to remember what they are and make allowances sometimes i wish we could hear of a country thats out of kings what was the use to tell jim these warnt real kings and dukes it wouldnt a done no good and besides it was just as i said you couldnt tell them from the real kind i went to sleep and jim didnt call me when it was my turn he often done that when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself i didnt take notice nor let on i knowed what it was about he was thinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was low and homesick because he hadnt ever been away from home before in his life and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for theirn it dont seem natural but i reckon its so he was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying po little lizabeth po little johnny its mighty hard i spec i aint ever gwyne to see you no mo no mo he was a mighty good nigger jim was but this time i somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones and by and by he says what makes me feel so bad dis time uz bekase i hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack er a

dumb en id ben a treatn her so chapter xxiv next day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle where there was a village on each side of the river and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns jim he spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldnt take but a few hours because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope you see when we left him all alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldnt look much like he was a runaway nigger you know so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day and hed cipher out some way to get around it he was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it he dressed jim up in king lears outfit it was a long curtain calico gown and a white horse hair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paint and painted jims face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead dull solid blue like a man thats been drownded nine days blamed if he warnt the horriblest looking outrage i ever see then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so sick arab but harmless when not out of his head and he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam jim was satisfied he said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all over every time there was a sound the duke told him to make himself free and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldnt wait for him to howl why he didnt only look like he was dead he looked considerable more than that these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again because there was so much money in it but they judged it wouldnt be safe because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time they couldnt hit no project that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned hed lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldnt put up something on the arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would drop over to t other village without any plan but just trust in providence to lead him the profitable way meaning the devil i reckon we had all bought store clothes where we stopped last and now the king put hisn on and he told me to put mine on i done it of course the kings duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy i never knowed how clothes could change a body before why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when hed take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that youd say he had walked right out of the ark and maybe was old leviticus himself jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point about three mile above the town been there a couple of hours taking on freight says the king seein how im dressed i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st louis or cincinnati or some other big place go for the steamboat huckleberry we ll come down to the village on her i didnt have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride i fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water pretty soon we come to a nice innocent looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had a couple of big carpet bags by him run her nose in shore says the king i done it wher you bound for young man for the steamboat going to orleans git aboard says the king hold on a minute my servant ll hep you with them bags jump out and hep the gentleman adolphus meaning me i see i done so and then we all three started on again the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather he asked the king where he was going and the king told him hed come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says when i first see you i says to myself its mr wilks sure and he come mighty near getting here in time but then i says again no i reckon it aint him or else he wouldnt be paddling up the river you aint him are you no my names blodgett elexander blodgett reverend elexander blodgett i s pose i must say as im one o the lords poor servants but still im jist as able to be sorry for mr wilks for not arriving in time all the same if hes missed anything by it which i hope he hasnt well he dont miss any property by it because he ll get that all right but hes missed seeing his brother peter die which he maynt mind nobody can tell as to that but his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died never talked about nothing else all these three weeks hadnt seen him since they was boys together and hadnt ever seen his brother william at all thats the deef and dumb one william aint more than thirty or thirty five peter and george were the only ones that come out here george was the married brother him and his wife both died last year harvey and williams the only ones thats left now and as i was saying they havent got here in time did anybody send em word oh yes a month or two ago when peter was first took because peter said then that he sorter felt like he warnt going to get well this time you see he was pretty old and georges g yirls was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the red headed one and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didnt seem to care much to live he most desperately wanted to see harvey and william too for that matter because he was one of them kind that cant bear to make a will he left a letter behind for harvey and said hed told in it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so georges g yirls would be all right for george didnt leave nothing and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to why do you reckon harvey dont come wher does he live oh he lives in england sheffield preaches there hasnt ever been in this country he hasnt had any too much time and besides he mightnt a got the letter at all you know too bad too bad he couldnt a lived to see his brothers poor soul you going to orleans you say yes but that aint only a part of it im going in a ship next wednesday for ryo janeero where my uncle lives its a pretty long journey but it ll be lovely wisht i was a going is mary jane the oldest how old is the others mary janes nineteen susans fifteen and joannas about fourteen thats the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare lip poor things to be left alone in the cold world so well they could be worse off old peter had friends and they aint going to let them come to no harm theres hobson the babtis preacher and deacon lot hovey and ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell the lawyer and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley and well theres a lot of them but these are the ones that peter was thickest with and used to write about sometimes when he wrote home so harvey ll know where to look for friends when he gets here well the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow blamed if he didnt inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkses and about peters business which was a tanner and about georges which was a carpenter and about harveys which was a dissentering minister and so on and so on then he says what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for because shes a big orleans boat and i was afeard she mightnt stop there when they re deep they wont stop for a hail a cincinnati boat will but this is a st louis one was peter wilks well off oh yes pretty well off he had houses and land and its reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som ers when did you say he died i didnt say but it was last night funeral to morrow likely yes bout the middle of the day well its all terrible sad but we ve all got to go one time or another so what we want to do is to be prepared then we re all right yes sir its the best way ma used to always say that when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off the king never said nothing about going aboard so i lost my ride after all when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and says now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags and if hes gone over to t other side go over there and git him and tell him to git himself up regardless shove along now i see what he was up to but i never said nothing of course when i got back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on a log and the king told him everything just like the young fellow had said it every last word of it and all the time he was a doing it he tried to talk like an englishman and he done it pretty well too for a slouch i cant imitate him and so i aint a going to try to but he really done it pretty good then he says how are you on the deef and dumb bilgewater the duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards so then they waited for a steamboat about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along but they didnt come from high enough up the river but at last there was a big one and they hailed her she sent out her yawl and we went aboard and she was from cincinnati and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing and said they wouldnt land us but the king was cam he says if gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry em cant it so they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore about two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a coming and when the king says kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher mr peter wilks lives they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say what d i tell you then one of them says kind of soft and gentle im sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live yesterday evening sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell up against the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down his back and says alas alas our poor brother gone and we never got to see him oh its too too hard then he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands and blamed if he didnt drop a carpet bag and bust out a crying if they warnt the beatenest lot them two frauds that ever i struck well the men gathered around and sympathized with them and said all sorts of kind things to them and carried their carpet bags up the hill for them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all about his brothers last moments and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tanner like theyd lost the twelve disciples well if ever i struck anything like it im a nigger it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race chapter xxv the news was all over town in two minutes and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting on their coats as they come pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march the windows and dooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fence is it them and somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say you bet it is when we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and the three girls was standing in the door mary jane was red headed but that dont make no difference she was most awful beautiful and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory she was so glad her uncles was come the king he spread his arms and mary jane she jumped for them and the hare lip jumped for the duke and there they had it everybody most leastways women cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times then the king he hunched the duke private i see him do it and then he looked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs so then him and the duke with a hand across each others shoulder and t other hand to their eyes walked slow and solemn over there everybody dropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stopping people saying sh and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads so you could a heard a pin fall and when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and then they bust out a crying so you could a heard them to orleans most and then they put their arms around each others necks and hung their chins over each others shoulders and then for three minutes or maybe four i never see two men leak the way they done and mind you everybody was doing the same and the place was that damp i never see anything like it then one of them got on one side of the coffin and t other on t other side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin and let on to pray all to themselves well when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud the poor girls too and every woman nearly went up to the girls without saying a word and kissed them solemn on the forehead and then put their hand on their head and looked up towards the sky with the tears running down and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing and give the next woman a show i never see anything so disgusting well by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little and works himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile but its a trial thats sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brothers heart because out of their mouths they cant words being too weak and cold and all that kind of rot and slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbers out a pious goody goody amen and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust and the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all their might and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out music is a good thing and after all that soul butter and hogwash i never see it freshen up things so and sound so honest and bully then the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening and help set up with the ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name for they was names that was very dear to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he will name the same to wit as follows vizz rev mr hobson and deacon lot hovey and mr ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley rev hobson and dr robinson was down to the end of the town a hunting together that is i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t other world and the preacher was pinting him right lawyer bell was away up to louisville on business but the rest was on hand and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him and then they shook hands with the duke and didnt say nothing but just kept a smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said goo goo goo goo goo all the time like a baby that cant talk so the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town or to georges family or to peter and he always let on that peter wrote him the things but that was a lie he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat then mary jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and the king he read it out loud and cried over it it give the dwelling house and three thousand dollars gold to the girls and it give the tanyard which was doing a good business along with some other houses and land worth about seven thousand and three thousand dollars in gold to harvey and william and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar so these two frauds said theyd go and fetch it up and have everything square and above board and told me to come with a candle we shut the cellar door behind us and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor and it was a lovely sight all them yaller boys my the way the kings eyes did shine he slaps the duke on the shoulder and says oh this aint bully nor nothn oh no i reckon not why bully it beats the nonesuch dont it the duke allowed it did they pawed the yaller boys and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor and the king says it aint no use talkin bein brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs thats got left is the line for you and me bilge thish yer comes of trustn to providence its the best way in the long run i ve tried em all and ther aint no better way most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile and took it on trust but no they must count it so they counts it and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short says the king dern him i wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars they worried over that awhile and ransacked all around for it then the duke says well he was a pretty sick man and likely he made a mistake i reckon thats the way of it the best ways to let it go and keep still about it we can spare it oh shucks yes we can spare it i dont k yer nothn bout that its the count im thinkin about we want to be awful square and open and above board here you know we want to lug this h yer money up stairs and count it before everybody then ther aint nothn suspicious but when the dead man says thers six thousn dollars you know we dont want to hold on says the duke les make up the deffisit and he begun to haul out yaller boys out of his pocket its a most amazn good idea duke you have got a rattlin clever head on you says the king blest if the old nonesuch aint a heppin us out agin and he begun to haul out yaller jackets and stack them up it most busted them but they made up the six thousand clean and clear say says the duke i got another idea les go up stairs and count this money and then take and give it to the girls good land duke lemme hug you its the most dazzling idea at ever a man struck you have cert nly got the most astonishin head i ever see oh this is the boss dodge ther aint no mistake bout it let em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to this ll lay em out when we got up stairs everybody gethered around the table and the king he counted it and stacked it up three hundred dollars in a pile twenty elegant little piles everybody looked hungry at it and licked their chops then they raked it into the bag again and i see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech he says friends all my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them thats left behind in the vale of sorrers he has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered and thats left fatherless and motherless yes and we that knowed him knows that he would a done more generous by em if he hadnt ben afeard o woundin his dear william and me now wouldnt he ther aint no question bout it in my mind well then what kind o brothers would it be thatd stand in his way at sech a time and what kind o uncles would it be thatd rob yes rob sech poor sweet lambs as these at he loved so at sech a time if i know william and i think i do he well i ll jest ask him he turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather headed a while then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning and jumps for the king goo gooing with all his might for joy and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up then the king says i knowed it i reckon that ll convince anybody the way he feels about it here mary jane susan joanner take the money take it all its the gift of him that lays yonder cold but joyful mary jane she went for him susan and the hare lip went for the duke and then such another hugging and kissing i never see yet and everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes and most shook the hands off of them frauds saying all the time you dear good souls how lovely how could you well then pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again and how good he was and what a loss he was and all that and before long a big iron jawed man worked himself in there from outside and stood a listening and looking and not saying anything and nobody saying anything to him either because the king was talking and they was all busy listening the king was saying in the middle of something hed started in on they bein partickler friends o the diseased thats why they re invited here this evenin but tomorrow we want all to come everybody for he respected everybody he liked everybody and so its fitten that his funeral orgies shd be public and so he went a mooning on and on liking to hear himself talk and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again till the duke he couldnt stand it no more so he writes on a little scrap of paper obsequies you old fool and folds it up and goes to goo gooing and reaching it over peoples heads to him the king he reads it and puts it in his pocket and says poor william afflicted as he is his hearts aluz right asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral wants me to make em all welcome but he neednt a worried it was jest what i was at then he weaves along again perfectly cam and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then just like he done before and when he done it the third time he says i say orgies not because its the common term because it aint obsequies bein the common term but because orgies is the right term obsequies aint used in england no more now its gone out we say orgies now in england orgies is better because it means the thing you re after more exact its a word thats made up outn the greek orgo outside open abroad and the hebrew jeesum to plant cover up hence in ter so you see funeral orgies is an open er public funeral he was the worst i ever struck well the iron jawed man he laughed right in his face everybody was shocked everybody says why doctor and abner shackleford says why robinson haint you heard the news this is harvey wilks the king he smiled eager and shoved out his flapper and says is it my poor brothers dear good friend and physician i keep your hands off of me says the doctor you talk like an englishman dont you its the worst imitation i ever heard you peter wilkss brother you re a fraud thats what you are well how they all took on they crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down and tried to explain to him and tell him how harveyd showed in forty ways that he was harvey and knowed everybody by name and the names of the very dogs and begged and begged him not to hurt harveys feelings and the poor girls feelings and all that but it warnt no use he stormed right along and said any man that pretended to be an englishman and couldnt imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar the poor girls was hanging to the king and crying and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them he says i was your fathers friend and im your friend and i warn you as a friend and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him the ignorant tramp with his idiotic greek and hebrew as he calls it he is the thinnest kind of an impostor has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres and you take them for proofs and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here who ought to know better mary jane wilks you know me for your friend and for your unselfish friend too now listen to me turn this pitiful rascal out i beg you to do it will you mary jane straightened herself up and my but she was handsome she says here is my answer she hove up the bag of money and put it in the kings hands and says take this six thousand dollars and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to and dont give us no receipt for it then she put her arm around the king on one side and susan and the hare lip done the same on the other everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud the doctor says all right i wash my hands of the matter but i warn you all that a times coming when you re going to feel sick whenever you think of this day and away he went all right doctor says the king kinder mocking him we ll try and get em to send for you which made them all laugh and they said it was a prime good hit chapter xxvi well when they was all gone the king he asks mary jane how they was off for spare rooms and she said she had one spare room which would do for uncle william and shed give her own room to uncle harvey which was a little bigger and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in it the king said the cubby would do for his valley meaning me so mary jane took us up and she showed them their rooms which was plain but nice she said shed have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in uncle harveys way but he said they warnt the frocks was hung along the wall and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor there was an old hair trunk in one corner and a guitar box in another and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around like girls brisken up a room with the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings and so dont disturb them the dukes room was pretty small but plenty good enough and so was my cubby that night they had a big supper and all them men and women was there and i stood behind the king and the dukes chairs and waited on them and the niggers waited on the rest mary jane she set at the head of the table with susan alongside of her and said how bad the biscuits was and how mean the preserves was and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was and all that kind of rot the way women always do for to force out compliments and the people all knowed everything was tiptop and said so said how do you get biscuits to brown so nice and where for the lands sake did you get these amazn pickles and all that kind of humbug talky talk just the way people always does at a supper you know and when it was all done me and the hare lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things the hare lip she got to pumping me about england and blest if i didnt think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes she says did you ever see the king who william fourth well i bet i have he goes to our church i knowed he was dead years ago but i never let on so when i says he goes to our church she says what regular yes regular his pews right over opposite ourn on t other side the pulpit i thought he lived in london well he does where would he live but i thought you lived in sheffield i see i was up a

regular where do you set why in our pew whose pew why ourn your uncle harveys hisn what does he want with a pew wants it to set in what did you reckon he wanted with it why i thought hed be in the pulpit rot him i forgot he was a preacher i see i was up a stump again so i played another chicken bone and got another think then i says blame it do you suppose there aint but one preacher to a church why what do they want with more what to preach before a king i never did see such a girl as you they dont have no less than seventeen seventeen my land why i wouldnt set out such a string as that not if i never got to glory it must take em a week shucks they dont all of em preach the same day only one of em well then what does the rest of em do oh nothing much loll around pass the plate and one thing or another but mainly they dont do nothing well then what are they for why they re for style dont you know nothing well i dont want to know no such foolishness as that how is servants treated in england do they treat em bettern we treat our niggers no a servant aint nobody there they treat them worse than dogs dont they give em holidays the way we do christmas and new years week and fourth of july oh just listen a body could tell you haint ever been to england by that why hare l why joanna they never see a holiday from years end to years end never go to the circus nor theater nor nigger shows nor nowheres nor church nor church but you always went to church well i was gone up again i forgot i was the old mans servant but next minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not and set with the family on account of its being the law but i didnt do it pretty good and when i got done i see she warnt satisfied she says honest injun now haint you been telling me a lot of lies honest injun says i none of it at all none of it at all not a lie in it says i lay your hand on this book and say it i see it warnt nothing but a dictionary so i laid my hand on it and said it so then she looked a little better satisfied and says well then i ll believe some of it but i hope to gracious if i ll believe the rest what is it you wont believe joe says mary jane stepping in with susan behind her it aint right nor kind for you to talk so to him and him a stranger and so far from his people how would you like to be treated so thats always your way maim always sailing in to help somebody before they re hurt i haint done nothing to him hes told some stretchers i reckon and i said i wouldnt swallow it all and thats every bit and grain i did say i reckon he can stand a little thing like that cant he i dont care whether twas little or whether twas big hes here in our house and a stranger and it wasnt good of you to say it if you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed and so you oughtnt to say a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed why mam he said it dont make no difference what he said that aint the thing the thing is for you to treat him kind and not be saying things to make him remember he aint in his own country and amongst his own folks i says to myself this is a girl that im letting that old reptile rob her of her money then susan she waltzed in and if you ll believe me she did give hare lip hark from the tomb says i to myself and this is another one that im letting him rob her of her money then mary jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovely again which was her way but when she got done there warnt hardly anything left o poor hare lip so she hollered all right then says the other girls you just ask his pardon she done it too and she done it beautiful she done it so beautiful it was good to hear and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies so she could do it again i says to myself this is another one that im letting him rob her of her money and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends i felt so ornery and low down and mean that i says to myself my minds made up i ll hive that money for them or bust so then i lit out for bed i said meaning some time or another when i got by myself i went to thinking the thing over i says to myself shall i go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds no that wont do he might tell who told him then the king and the duke would make it warm for me shall i go private and tell mary jane no i dasnt do it her face would give them a hint sure they ve got the money and theyd slide right out and get away with it if she was to fetch in help id get mixed up in the business before it was done with i judge no there aint no good way but one i got to steal that money somehow and i got to steal it some way that they wont suspicion that i done it they ve got a good thing here and they aint a going to leave till they ve played this family and this town for all they re worth so i ll find a chance time enough i ll steal it and hide it and by and by when im away down the river i ll write a letter and tell mary jane where its hid but i better hive it tonight if i can because the doctor maybe hasnt let up as much as he lets on he has he might scare them out of here yet so thinks i i ll go and search them rooms upstairs the hall was dark but i found the dukes room and started to paw around it with my hands but i recollected it wouldnt be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self so then i went to his room and begun to paw around there but i see i couldnt do nothing without a candle and i dasnt light one of course so i judged id got to do the other thing lay for them and eavesdrop about that time i hears their footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed i reached for it but it wasnt where i thought it would be but i touched the curtain that hid mary janes frocks so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly still they come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed then i was glad i hadnt found the bed when i wanted it and yet you know its kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private they sets down then and the king says well what is it and cut it middlin short because its better for us to be down there a whoopin up the mournin than up here givin em a chance to talk us over well this is it capet i aint easy i aint comfortable that doctor lays on my mind i wanted to know your plans i ve got a notion and i think its a sound one what is it duke that we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clip it down the river with what we ve got specially seeing we got it so easy given back to us flung at our heads as you may say when of course we allowed to have to steal it back im for knocking off and lighting out that made me feel pretty bad about an hour or two ago it would a been a little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed the king rips out and says what and not sell out the rest o the property march off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thousn dollars worth o property layin around jest sufferin to be scooped in and all good salable stuff too the duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didnt want to go no deeper didnt want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had why how you talk says the king we shan t rob em of nothing at all but jest this money the people that buys the property is the suff rers because as soons its found out at we didnt own it which wont be long after we ve slid the sale wont be valid and it ll all go back to the estate these yer orphans ll git their house back agin and thats enough for them they re young and spry and kn easy earn a livin they aint a goin to suffer why jest think theres thousn s and thousn s that aint nigh so well off bless you they aint got nothn to complain of well the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said all right but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and that doctor hanging over them but the king says cuss the doctor what do we k yer for him haint we got all the fools in town on our side and aint that a big enough majority in any town so they got ready to go down stairs again the duke says i dont think we put that money in a good place that cheered me up id begun to think i warnt going to get a hint of no kind to help me the king says why because mary jane ll be in mourning from this out and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it your heads level agin duke says the king and he comes a fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where i was i stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still though quivery and i wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me and i tried to think what id better do if they did catch me but the king he got the bag before i could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicioned i was around they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather bed and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger only makes up the feather bed and dont turn over the straw tick only about twice a year and so it warnt in no danger of getting stole now but i knowed better i had it out of there before they was half way down stairs i groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till i could get a chance to do better i judged i better hide it outside of the house somewheres because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking i knowed that very well then i turned in with my clothes all on but i couldnt a gone to sleep if id a wanted to i was in such a sweat to get through with the business by and by i heard the king and the duke come up so i rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen but nothing did so i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadnt begun yet and then i slipped down the ladder chapter xxvii i crept to their doors and listened they was snoring so i tiptoed along and got down stairs all right there warnt a sound anywheres i peeped through a crack of the dining room door and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs the door was open into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was a candle in both rooms i passed along and the parlor door was open but i see there warnt nobody in there but the remainders of peter so i shoved on by but the front door was locked and the key wasnt there just then i heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me i run in the parlor and took a swift look around and the only place i see to hide the bag was in the coffin the lid was shoved along about a foot showing the dead mans face down in there with a wet cloth over it and his shroud on i tucked the money bag in under the lid just down beyond where his hands was crossed which made me creep they was so cold and then i run back across the room and in behind the door the person coming was mary jane she went to the coffin very soft and kneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and i see she begun to cry though i couldnt hear her and her back was to me i slid out and as i passed the dining room i thought id make sure them watchers hadnt seen me so i looked through the crack and everything was all right they hadnt stirred i slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thing playing out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it says i if it could stay where it is all right because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back to mary jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that aint the thing thats going to happen the thing thats going to happen is the money ll be found when they come to screw on the lid then the king ll get it again and it ll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him of course i wanted to slide down and get it out of there but i dasnt try it every minute it was getting earlier now and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir and i might get catched catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadnt hired me to take care of i dont wish to be mixed up in no such business as that i says to myself when i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and the watchers was gone there warnt nobody around but the family and the widow bartley and our tribe i watched their faces to see if anything had been happening but i couldnt tell towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and then set all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining room was full i see the coffin lid was the way it was before but i dasnt go to look in under it with folks around then the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at the dead mans face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it was all very still and solemn only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent and sobbing a little there warnt no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church when the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways putting on the last touches and getting people and things all ship shape and comfortable and making no more sound than a cat he never spoke he moved people around he squeezed in late ones he opened up passageways and done it with nods and signs with his hands then he took his place over against the wall he was the softest glidingest stealthiest man i ever see and there warnt no more smile to him than there is to a ham they had borrowed a melodeum a sick one and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky and colicky and everybody joined in and sung and peter was the only one that had a good thing according to my notion then the reverend hobson opened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was only one dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up right along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and wait you couldnt hear yourself think it was right down awkward and nobody didnt seem to know what to do but pretty soon they see that long legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say dont you worry just depend on me then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the peoples heads so he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around two sides of the room he disappears down cellar then in about two seconds we heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off in a minute or two here comes this undertakers back and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room and then rose up and shaded his mouth with his hands and stretched his neck out towards the preacher over the peoples heads and says in a kind of a coarse whisper he had a rat then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place you could see it was a great satisfaction to the people because naturally they wanted to know a little thing like that dont cost nothing and its just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked there warnt no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was well the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage and at last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw driver i was in a sweat then and watched him pretty keen but he never meddled at all just slid the lid along as soft as mush and screwed it down tight and fast so there i was i didnt know whether the money was in there or not so says is pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly now how do i know whether to write to mary jane or nots pose she dug him up and didnt find nothing what would she think of me blame it i says i might get hunted up and jailed id better lay low and keep dark and not write at all the things awful mixed now trying to better it i ve worsened it a hundred times and i wish to goodness id just let it alone dad fetch the whole business they buried him and we come back home and i went to watching faces again i couldnt help it and i couldnt rest easy but nothing come of it the faces didnt tell me nothing the king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody up and made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that his congregation over in england would be in a sweat about him so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home he was very sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody they wished he could stay longer but they said they could see it couldnt be done and he said of course him and william would take the girls home with them and that pleased everybody too because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations and it pleased the girls too tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so but i didnt see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune well blamed if the king didnt bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off sale two days after the funeral but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to so the next day after the funeral along about noon time the girls joy got the first jolt a couple of nigger traders come along and the king sold them the niggers reasonable for three day drafts as they called it and away they went the two sons up the river to memphis and their mother down the river to orleans i thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief they cried around each other and took on so it most made me down sick to see it the girls said they hadnt ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town i cant ever get it out of my memory the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each others necks and crying and i reckon i couldnt a stood it all but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if i hadnt knowed the sale warnt no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two the thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way it injured the frauds some but the old fool he bulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and i tell you the duke was powerful uneasy next day was auction day about broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and i see by their look that there was trouble the king says was you in my room night before last no your majesty which was the way i always called him when nobody but our gang warnt around was you in there yisterday er last night no your majesty honor bright now no lies honor bright your majesty im telling you the truth i haint been a near your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it to you the duke says have you seen anybody else go in there no your grace not as i remember i believe stop and think i studied awhile and see my chance then i says well i see the niggers go in there several times both of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadnt ever expected it and then like they had then the duke says what all of them no leastways not all at once that is i dont think i ever see them all come out at once but just one time hello when was that it was the day we had the funeral in the morning it warnt early because i overslept i was just starting down the ladder and i see them well go on go on what did they do howd they act they didnt do nothing and they didnt act anyway much as fur as i see they tiptoed away so i seen easy enough that theyd shoved in there to do up your majestys room or somethings posing you was up and found you warnt up and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up if they hadnt already waked you up great guns this is a go says the king and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly they stood there a thinking and scratching their heads a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle and says it does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand they let on to be sorry they was going out of this region and i believed they was sorry and so did you and so did everybody dont ever tell me any more that a nigger aint got any histrionic talent why the way they played that thing it would fool anybody in my opinion theres a fortune in em if i had capital and a theater i wouldnt want a better lay out than that and here we ve gone and sold em for a song yes and aint privileged to sing the song yet say where is that song that draft in the bank for to be collected where would it be well thats all right then thank goodness says i kind of timid like is something gone wrong the king whirls on me and rips out none o your business you keep your head shet and mind yr own affairs if you got any long as you re in this town dont you forgit that you hear then he says to the duke we got to jest swaller it and say nothn mums the word for us as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again and says quick sales and small profits its a good business yes the king snarls around on him and says i was trying to do for the best in sellin em out so quick if the profits has turned out to be none lackin considable and none to carry is it my fault any moren its yourn well theyd be in this house yet and we wouldnt if i could a got my advice listened to the king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swapped around and lit into me again he give me down the banks for not coming and telling him i see the niggers come out of his room acting that way said any fool would a knowed something was up and then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning and hed be blamed if hed ever do it again so they went off a jawing and i felt dreadful glad id worked it all off on to the niggers and yet hadnt done the niggers no harm by it chapter xxviii by and by it was getting up time so i come down the ladder and started for down stairs but as i come to the girls room the door was open and i see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and shed been packing things in it getting ready to go to england but she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in her hands crying i felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would i went in there and says miss mary jane you cant a bear to see people in trouble and i cant most always tell me about it so she done it and it was the niggers i just expected it she said the beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her she didnt know how she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother and the children warnt ever going to see each other no more and then busted out bitterer than ever and flung up her hands and says oh dear dear to think they aint ever going to see each other any more but they will and inside of two weeks and i know it says i laws it was out before i could think and before i could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again say it again say it again i see i had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a close place i asked her to let me think a minute and she set there very impatient and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy and eased up like a person thats had a tooth pulled out so i went to studying it out i says to myself i reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks though i aint had no experience and cant say for certain but it looks so to me anyway and yet heres a case where im blest if it dont look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie i must lay it by in my mind and think it over some time or other its so kind of strange and unregular i never see nothing like it well i says to myself at last im a going to chance it i ll up and tell the truth this time though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you ll go to then i says miss mary jane is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days yes mr lothrops why never mind why yet if i ll tell you how i know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks here in this house and prove how i know it will you go to mr lothrops and stay four days four days she says i ll stay a year all right i says i dont want nothing more out of you than just your word i druther have it than another mans kiss the bible she smiled and reddened up very sweet and i says if you dont mind it i ll shut the door and bolt it then i come back and set down again and says dont you holler just set still and take it like a man i got to tell the truth and you want to brace up miss mary because its a bad kind and going to be hard to take but there aint no help for it these uncles of yourn aint no uncles at all they re a couple of frauds regular dead beats there now we re over the worst of it you can stand the rest middling easy it jolted her up like everything of course but i was over the shoal water now so i went right along her eyes a blazing higher and higher all the time and told her every blame thing from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat clear through to where she flung herself on to the kings breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times and then up she jumps with her face afire like sunset and says the brute come dont waste a minute not a second we ll have them tarred and feathered and flung in the river says i cert nly but do you mean before you go to mr lothrops or oh she says what am i thinking about she says and set right down again dont mind what i said please dont you wont now will you laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that i said i would die first i never thought i was so stirred up she says now go on and i wont do so any more you tell me what to do and whatever you say i ll do it well i says its a rough gang them two frauds and im fixed so i got to travel with them a while longer whether i want to or not i druther not tell you why and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws and id be all right but thered be another person that you dont know about whod be in big trouble well we got to save him haint we of course well then we wont blow on them saying them words put a good idea in my head i see how maybe i could get me and jim rid of the frauds get them jailed here and then leave but i didnt want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me so i didnt want the plan to begin working till pretty late to night i says miss mary jane i ll tell you what we ll do and you wont have to stay at mr lothrops so long nuther how fur is it a little short of four miles right out in the country back here well that ll answer now you go along out there and lay low till nine or half past to night and then get them to fetch you home again tell them you ve thought of something if you get here before eleven put a candle in this window and if i dont turn up wait till eleven and then if i dont turn up it means im gone and out of the way and safe then you come out and spread the news around and get these beats jailed good she says i ll do it and if it just happens so that i dont get away but get took up along with them you must up and say i told you the whole thing beforehand and you must stand by me all you can stand by you indeed i will they shan t touch a hair of your head she says and i see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it too if i get away i shan t be here i says to prove these rapscallions aint your uncles and i couldnt do it if i was here i could swear they was beats and bummers thats all though thats worth something well theres others can do that better than what i can and they re people that aint going to be doubted as quick as id be i ll tell you how to find them gimme a pencil and a piece of paper there royal nonesuch bricksville put it away and dont lose it when the court wants to find out something about these two let them send up to bricksville and say they ve got the men that played the royal nonesuch and ask for some witnesses why you ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink miss mary and they ll come a biling too i judged we had got everything fixed about right now so i says just let the auction go right along and dont worry nobody dont have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice and they aint going out of this till they get that money and the way we ve fixed it the sale aint going to count and they aint going to get no money its just like the way it was with the niggers it warnt no sale and the niggers will be back before long why they cant collect the money for the niggers yet they re in the worst kind of a fix miss mary well she says i ll run down to breakfast now and then i ll start straight for mr lothrops deed that aint the ticket miss mary jane i says by no manner of means go before breakfast why what did you reckon i wanted you to go at all for miss mary well i never thought and come to think i dont know what was it why its because you aint one of these leather face people i dont want no better book than what your face is a body can set down and read it off like coarse print do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good morning and never there there dont yes i ll go before breakfast i ll be glad to and leave my sisters with them yes never mind about them they ve got to stand it yet a while they might suspicion something if all of you was to go i dont want you to see them nor your sisters nor nobody in this town if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something no you go right along miss mary jane and i ll fix it with all of them i ll tell miss susan to give your love to your uncles and say you ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change or to see a friend and you ll be back to night or early in the morning gone to see a friend is all right but i wont have my love given to them well then it shan t be it was well enough to tell her so no harm in it it was only a little thing to do and no trouble and its the little things that smooths peoples roads the most down here below it would make mary jane comfortable and it wouldnt cost nothing then i says theres one more thing that bag of money well they ve got that and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it no you re out there they haint got it why whos got it i wish i knowed but i dont i had it because i stole it from them and i stole it to give to you and i know where i hid it but im afraid it aint there no more im awful sorry miss mary jane im just as sorry as i can be but i done the best i could i did honest i come nigh getting caught and i had to shove it into the first place i come to and run and it warnt a good place oh stop blaming yourself its too bad to do it and i wont allow it you couldnt help it it wasnt your fault where did you hide it i didnt want to set her to thinking about her troubles again and i couldnt seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach so for a minute i didnt say nothing then i says id ruther not tell you where i put it miss mary jane if you dont mind letting me off but i ll write it for you on a piece of paper and you can read it along the road to mr lothrops if you want to do you reckon that ll do oh yes so i wrote i put it in the coffin it was in there when you was crying there away in the night i was behind the door and i was mighty sorry for you miss mary jane it made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night and them devils laying there right under her own roof shaming her and robbing her and when i folded it up and give it to her i see the water come into her eyes too and she shook me by the hand hard and says good bye im going to do everything just as you ve told me and if i dont ever see you again i shan t ever forget you and i ll think of you a many and a many a time and i ll pray for you too and she was gone pray for me i reckoned if she knowed me shed take a job that was more nearer her size but i bet she done it just the same she was just that kind she had the grit to pray for judus if she took the notion there warnt no back down to her i judge you may say what you want to but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl i ever see in my opinion she was just full of sand it sounds like flattery but it aint no flattery and when it comes to beauty and goodness too she lays over them all i haint ever seen her since that time that i see her go out of that door no i haint ever seen her since but i reckon i ve thought of her a many and a many a million times and of her saying she would pray for me and if ever id a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her blamed if i wouldnt a done it or bust well mary jane she lit out the back way i reckon because nobody see her go when i struck susan and the hare lip i says whats the name of them people over on t other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes they says theres several but its the proctors mainly thats the name i says i most forgot it well miss mary jane she told me to tell you shes gone over there in a dreadful hurry one of thems sick which one i dont know leastways i kinder forget but i thinks its sakes alive i hope it aint hanner im sorry to say it i says but hanners the very one my goodness and she so well only last week is she took bad it aint no name for it they set up with her all night miss mary jane said and they dont think she ll last many hours only think of that now whats the matter with her i couldnt think of anything reasonable right off that way so i says mumps mumps your granny they dont set up with people thats got the mumps they dont dont they you better bet they do with these mumps these mumps is different its a new kind miss mary jane said hows it a new kind because its mixed up with other things what other things well measles and whooping cough and erysiplas and consumption and yaller janders and brain fever and i dont know what all my land and they call it the mumps thats what miss mary jane said well what in the nation do they call it the mumps for why because it is the mumps thats what it starts with well ther aint no sense in it a body might stump his toe and take pison and fall down the well and break his neck and bust his brains out and somebody come along and ask what killed him and some numskull up and say why he stumped his toe would ther be any sense in that no and ther aint no sense in this nuther is it ketching is it ketching why how you talk is a harrow catching in the dark if you dont hitch on to one tooth you re bound to on another aint you and you cant get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along can you well these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow as you may say and it aint no slouch of a harrow nuther you come to get it hitched on good well its awful i think says the hare lip i ll go to uncle harvey and oh yes i says i would of course i would i wouldnt lose no time well why wouldnt you just look at it a minute and maybe you can see haint your uncles obleegd to get along home to england as fast as they can and do you reckon theyd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves you know they ll wait for you so fur so good your uncle harveys a preacher aint he very well then is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk is he going to deceive a ship clerk so as to get them to let miss mary jane go aboard now you know he aint what will he do then why he ll say its a great pity but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus unum mumps and so its my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if shes got it but never mind if you think its best to tell your uncle harvey shucks and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in england whilst we was waiting to find out whether mary janes got it or not why you talk like a muggins well anyway maybe youd better tell some of the neighbors listen at that now you do beat all for natural stupidness cant you see that theyd go and tell ther aint no way but just to not tell anybody at all well maybe you re right yes i judge you are right but i reckon we ought to tell uncle harvey shes gone out a while anyway so he wont be uneasy about her yes miss mary jane she wanted you to do that she says tell them to give uncle harvey and william my love and a kiss and say i ve run over the river to see mr mr what is the name of that rich family your uncle peter used to think so much of i mean the one that why you must mean the apthorps aint it of course bother them kind of names a body cant ever seem to remember them half the time somehow yes she said say she has run over for to ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house because she allowed her uncle peter would ruther they had it than anybody else and shes going to stick to them till they say they ll come and then if she aint too tired shes coming home and if she is she ll be home in the morning anyway she said dont say nothing about the proctors but only about the apthorps which ll be perfectly true because she is going there to speak about their buying the house i know it because she told me so herself all right they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles and give them the love and the kisses and tell them the message everything was all right now the girls wouldnt say nothing because they wanted to go to england and the king and the duke would ruther mary jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of doctor robinson i felt very good i judged i had done it pretty neat i reckoned tom sawyer couldnt a done it no neater himself of course he would a throwed more style into it but i cant do that very handy not being brung up to it well they held the auction in the public square along towards the end of the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of the auctioneer and chipping in a little scripture now and then or a little goody goody saying of some kind and the duke he was around goo gooing for sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generly but by and by the thing dragged through and everything was sold everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard so theyd got to work that off i never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow everything well whilst they was at it a steamboat landed and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on and singing out heres your opposition line heres your two sets o heirs to old peter wilks and you pays your money and you takes your choice chapter xxix they was fetching a very nice looking old gentleman along and a nice looking younger one with his right arm in a sling and my souls how the people yelled and laughed and kept it up but i didnt see no joke about it and i judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any i reckoned theyd turn pale but no nary a pale did they turn the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up but just went a goo gooing around happy and satisfied like a jug thats googling out buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new comers like it give him the stomach ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world oh he done it admirable lots of the principal people gethered around the king to let him see they was on his side that old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death pretty soon he begun to speak and i see straight off he pronounced like an englishman not the kings way though the kings was pretty good for an imitation i cant give the old gents words nor i cant imitate him but he turned around to the crowd and says about like this this is a surprise to me which i wasnt looking for and i ll acknowledge candid and frank i aint very well fixed to meet it and answer it for my brother and me has had misfortunes hes broke his arm and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake i am peter wilks brother harvey and this is his brother william which cant hear nor speak and cant even make signs to amount to much nowt hes only got one hand to work them with we are who we say we are and in a day or two when i get the baggage i can prove it but up till then i wont say nothing more but go to the hotel and wait so him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs and blethers out broke his arm very likely aint it and very convenient too for a fraud thats got to make signs and aint learnt how lost their baggage thats mighty good and mighty ingenious under the circumstances so he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or four or maybe half a dozen one of these was that doctor another one was a sharp looking gentleman with a carpet bag of the old fashioned kind made out of carpet stuff that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads it was levi bell the lawyer that was gone up to louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to the king now and when the king got done this husky up and says say looky here if you are harvey wilks whend you come to this town the day before the funeral friend says the king but what time o day in the evenin bout an hour er two before sundown howd you come i come down on the susan powell from cincinnati well then howd you come to be up at the pint in the mornin in a canoe i warnt up at the pint in the mornin its a lie several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher preacher be hanged hes a fraud and a liar he was up at the pint that mornin i live up there dont i well i was up there and he was up there i see him there he come in a canoe along with tim collins and a boy the doctor he up and says would you know the boy again if you was to see him hines i reckon i would but i dont know why yonder he is now i know him perfectly easy it was me he pointed at the doctor says neighbors i dont know whether the new couple is frauds or not but if these two aint frauds i am an idiot thats all i think its our duty to see that they dont get away from here till we ve looked into this thing come along hines come along the rest of you we ll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t other couple and i reckon we ll find out something before we get through it was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the kings friends so we all started it was about sundown the doctor he led me along by the hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my hand we all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candles and fetched in the new couple first the doctor says i dont wish to be too hard on these two men but i think they re frauds and they may have complices that we dont know nothing about if they have wont the complices get away with that bag of gold peter wilks left it aint unlikely if these men aint frauds they wont object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they re all right aint that so everybody agreed to that so i judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart but the king he only looked sorrowful and says gentlemen i wish the money was there for i aint got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair open out and out investigation o this misable business but alas the money aint there you kn send and see if you want to where is it then well when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid it inside o the straw tick o my bed not wishin to bank it for the few days wed be here and considerin the bed a safe place we not bein used to niggers and supposn em honest like servants in england the niggers stole it the very next mornin after i had went down stairs and when i sold em i hadnt missed the money yit so they got clean away with it my servant here kn tell you bout it gentlemen the doctor and several said shucks and i see nobody didnt altogether believe him one man asked me if i see the niggers steal it i said no but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and i never thought nothing only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them that was all they asked me then the doctor whirls on me and says are you english too i says yes and him and some others laughed and said stuff well then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we had it up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word about supper nor ever seemed to think about it and so they kept it up and kept it up and it was the worst mixed up thing you ever see they made the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell hisn and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t other one lies and by and by they had me up to tell what i knowed the king he give me a left handed look out of the corner of his eye and so i knowed enough to talk on the right side i begun to tell about sheffield and how we lived there and all about the english wilkses and so on but i didnt get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh and levi bell the lawyer says set down my boy i wouldnt strain myself if i was you i reckon you aint used to lying it dont seem to come handy what you want is practice you do it pretty awkward i didnt care nothing for the compliment but i was glad to be let off anyway the doctor he started to say something and turns and says if youd been in town at first levi bell the king broke in and reached out his hand and says why is this my poor dead brothers old friend that hes wrote so often about the lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased and they talked right along awhile and then got to one side and talked low and at last the lawyer speaks up and says that ll fix it i ll take the order and send it along with your brothers and then they ll know its all right so they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off something and then they give the pen to the duke and then for the first time the duke looked sick but he took the pen and wrote so then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names the old gentleman wrote but nobody couldnt read it the lawyer looked powerful astonished and says well it beats me and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket and examined them and then examined the old mans writing and then them again and then says these old letters is from harvey wilks and heres these two handwritings and anybody can see they didnt write them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish i tell you to see how the lawyer had took them in and heres this old gentlemans hand writing and anybody can tell easy enough he didnt write them fact is the scratches he makes aint properly writing at all now heres some letters from the new old gentleman says if you please let me explain nobody can read my hand but my brother there so he copies for me its his hand you ve got there not mine well says the lawyer this is a state of things i ve got some of williams letters too so if you ll get him to write a line or so we can com he cant write with his left hand says the old gentleman if he could use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too look at both please they re by the same hand the lawyer done it and says i believe its so and if it aint so theres a heap stronger resemblance than id noticed before anyway well well well i thought we was right on the track of a solution but its gone to grass partly but anyway one thing is proved these two aint either of em wilkses and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke well what do you think that muleheaded old fool wouldnt give in then indeed he wouldnt said it warnt no fair test said his brother william was the cussedest joker in the world and hadnt tried to write he see william was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper and so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in and says i ve thought of something is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br helped to lay out the late peter wilks for burying yes says somebody me and ab turner done it we re both here then the old man turns towards the king and says perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast blamed if the king didnt have to brace up mighty quick or hed a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it took him so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man he whitened a little he couldnt help it and it was mighty still in there and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him says i to myself now he ll throw up the sponge there aint no more use well did he a body cant hardly believe it but he didnt i reckon he thought hed keep the thing up till he tired them people out so theyd thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away anyway he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and says mf its a very tough question aint it yes sir i kn tell you whats tattooed on his breast its jest a small thin blue arrow thats what it is and if you dont look clost you cant see it now what do you say hey well i never see anything like that old blister for clean out and out cheek the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard and his eye lights up like he judged hed got the king this time and says there you ve heard what he said was there any such mark on peter wilks breast both of them spoke up and says we didnt see no such mark good says the old gentleman now what you did see on his breast was a small dim p and a b which is an initial he dropped when he was young and a w with dashes between them sop bw and he marked them that way on a piece of paper come aint that what you saw both of them spoke up again and says no we didnt we never seen any marks at all well everybody was in a state of mind now and they sings out the whole bilin ofm s frauds les duck em les drown em les ride em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once and there was a rattling powwow but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells and says gentlemen gentle men hear me just a word just a single word if you please theres one way yet lets go and dig up the corpse and look that took them hooray they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyer and the doctor sung out hold on hold on collar all these four men and the boy and fetch them along too we ll do it they all shouted and if we dont find them marks we ll lynch the whole gang i was scared now i tell you but there warnt no getting away you know they gripped us all and marched us right along straight for the graveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the whole town at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in the evening as we went by our house i wished i hadnt sent mary jane out of town because now if i could tip her the wink shed light out and save me and blow on our dead beats well we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on like wildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome i ever was in and i was kinder stunned everything was going so different from what i had allowed for stead of being fixed so i could take my own time if i wanted to and see all the fun and have mary jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close fit come here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo marks if they didnt find them i couldnt bear to think about it and yet somehow i couldnt think about nothing else it got darker and darker and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by the wrist hines and a body might as well try to give goliar the slip he dragged me right along he was so excited and i had to run to keep up when they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow and when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadnt thought to fetch a lantern but they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half a mile off to borrow one so they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rain started and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning come brisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never took no notice of it they was so full of this business and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second the dark wiped it all out and you couldnt see nothing at all at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was to scrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way it was awful hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so and i reckon he clean forgot i was in the world he was so excited and panting all of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare and somebody sings out by the living jingo heres the bag of gold on his breast hines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way i lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there aint nobody can tell i had the road all to myself and i fairly flew leastways i had it all to myself except the solid dark and the now and then glares and the buzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting of the thunder and sure as you are born i did clip it along when i struck the town i see there warnt nobody out in the storm so i never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through the main one and when i begun to get towards our house i aimed my eye and set it no light there the house all dark which made me feel sorry and disappointed i didnt know why but at last just as i was sailing by flash comes the light in mary janes window and my heart swelled up sudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark and wasnt ever going to be before me no more in this world she was the best girl i ever see and had the most sand the minute i was far enough above the town to see i could make the towhead i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasnt chained i snatched it and shoved it was a canoe and warnt fastened with nothing but a rope the towhead was a rattling big distance off away out there in the middle of the river but i didnt lose no time and when i struck the raft at last i was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could afforded it but i didnt as i sprung aboard i sung out out with you jim and set her loose glory be to goodness we re shut of them jim lit out and was a coming for me with both arms spread he was so full of joy but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and i went overboard backwards for i forgot he was old king lear and a drownded a rab all in one and it most scared the livers and lights out of me but jim fished me out and was going to hug me and bless me and so on he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the king and the duke but i says not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast cut loose and let her slide so in two seconds away we went a sliding down the river and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and nobody to bother us i had to skip around a bit and jump up and crack my heels a few times i couldnt help it but about the third crack i noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well and held my breath and listened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted out over the water here they come and just a laying to their oars and making their skiff hum it was the king and the duke so i wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it was all i could do to keep from crying chapter xxx when they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collar and says tryin to give us the slip was ye you pup tired of our company hey i says no your majesty we warnt please dont your majesty quick then and tell us what was your idea or i ll shake the insides out o you honest i ll tell you everything just as it happened your majesty the man that had a holt of me was very good to me and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets go of me and whispers heel it now or they ll hang ye sure and i lit out it didnt seem no good for me to stay i couldnt do nothing and i didnt want to be hung if i could get away so i never stopped running till i found the canoe and when i got here i told jim to hurry or theyd catch me and hang me yet and said i was afeard you and the duke wasnt alive now and i was awful sorry and so was jim and was awful glad when we see you coming you may ask jim if i didnt jim said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said oh yes its mighty likely and shook me up again and said he reckoned hed drownd me but the duke says leggo the boy you old idiot would you a done any different did you inquire around for him when you got loose i dont remember it so the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it but the duke says you better a blame sight give yourself a good cussing for you re the one thats entitled to it most you haint done a thing from the start that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue arrow mark that was bright it was right down bully and it was the thing that saved us for if it hadnt been for that theyd a jailed us till them englishmens baggage come and then the penitentiary you bet but that trick took em to the graveyard and the gold done us a still bigger kindness for if the excited fools hadnt let go all holts and made that rush to get a look wed a slept in our cravats to night cravats warranted to wear too longer than wed need em they was still a minute thinking then the king says kind of absent minded like mf and we reckoned the niggers stole it that made me squirm yes says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic we did after about a half a minute the king drawls out leastways i did the duke says the same way on the contrary i did the king kind of ruffles up and says looky here bilgewater whatr you referrin to the duke says pretty brisk when it comes to that maybe you ll let me ask what was you referring to shucks says the king very sarcastic but i dont know maybe you was asleep and didnt know what you was about the duke bristles up now and says oh let up on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame fool dont you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffin yes sir i know you do know because you done it yourself its a lie and the duke went for him the king sings out take yr hands off leggo my throat i take it all back the duke says well you just own up first that you did hide that money there intending to give me the slip one of these days and come back and dig it up and have it all to yourself wait jest a minute duke answer me this one question honest and fair if you didnt put the money there say it and i ll b lieve you and take back everything i said you old scoundrel i didnt and you know i didnt there now well then i b lieve you but answer me only jest this one more now dont git mad didnt you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it the duke never said nothing for a little bit then he says well i dont care if i did i didnt do it anyway but you not only had it in mind to do it but you done it i wisht i never die if i done it duke and thats honest i wont say i warnt goin to do it because i was but you i mean somebody got in ahead o me its a lie you done it and you got to say you done it or the king began to gurgle and then he gasps out nough i own up i was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easier than what i was feeling before so the duke took his hands off and says if you ever deny it again i ll drown you its well for you to set there and blubber like a baby its fitten for you after the way you ve acted i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything and i a trusting you all the time like you was my own father you ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers and you never say a word for em it makes me feel ridiculous to think i was soft enough to believe that rubbage cuss you i can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit you wanted to get what money id got out of the nonesuch and one thing or another and scoop it all the king says timid and still a snuffling why duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warnt me dry up i dont want to hear no more out of you says the duke and now you see what you got by it they ve got all their own money back and all of ourn but a shekel or two besidesg long to bed and dont you deffersit me no more deffersits longs you live so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort and before long the duke tackled his bottle and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got the lovinger they got and went off a snoring in each others arms they both got powerful mellow but i noticed the king didnt get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money bag again that made me feel easy and satisfied of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble and i told jim everything chapter xxxi we dasnt stop again at any town for days and days kept right along down the river we was down south in the warm weather now and a mighty long ways from home we begun to come to trees with spanish moss on them hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards it was the first i ever see it growing and it made the woods look solemn and dismal so now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and they begun to work the villages again first they done a lecture on temperance but they didnt make enough for them both to get drunk on then in another village they started a dancing school but they didnt know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town another time they tried to go at yellocution but they didnt yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing and made them skip out they tackled missionarying and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes and a little of everything but they couldnt seem to have no luck so at last they got just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she floated along thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by the half a day at a time and dreadful blue and desperate and at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time jim and me got uneasy we didnt like the look of it we judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever we turned it over and over and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebodys house or store or was going into the counterfeit money business or something so then we was pretty scared and made up an agreement that we wouldnt have nothing in the world to do with such actions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind well early one morning we hid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named pikesville and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet house to rob you mean says i to myself and when you get through robbing it you ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and the raft and you ll have to take it out in wondering and he said if he warnt back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right and we was to come along so we stayed where we was the duke he fretted and sweated around and was in a mighty sour way he scolded us for everything and we couldnt seem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thing something was a brewing sure i was good and glad when midday come and no king we could have a change anyway and maybe a chance for the change on top of it so me and the duke went up to the village and hunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport and he a cussing and a threatening with all his might and so tight he couldnt walk and couldnt do nothing to them the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the king begun to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the river road like a deer for i see our chance and i made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and jim again i got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy and sung out set her loose jim we re all right now but there warnt no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam jim was gone i set up a shout and then another and then another one and run this way and that in the woods whooping and screeching but it warnt no use old jim was gone then i set down and cried i couldnt help it but i couldnt set still long pretty soon i went out on the road trying to think what i better do and i run across a boy walking and asked him if hed seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he says yes whereabouts says i down to silas phelps place two mile below here hes a runaway nigger and they ve got him was you looking for him you bet i aint i run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago and he said if i hollered hed cut my livers out and told me to lay down and stay where i was and i done it been there ever since afeard to come out well he says you neednt be afeard no more becuz they ve got him he run off fm down south som ers its a good job they got him well i reckon theres two hunderd dollars reward on him its like picking up money outn the road yes it is and i could a had it if id been big enough i see him first who nailed him it was an old fellow a stranger and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars becuz hes got to go up the river and cant wait think o that now you bet id wait if it was seven year thats me every time says i but maybe his chance aint worth no more than that if he ll sell it so cheap maybe theres something aint straight about it but it is though straight as a string i see the handbill myself it tells all about him to a dot paints him like a picture and tells the plantation hes frum below newr leans no sirree bob they aint no trouble bout that speculation you bet you say gimme a chaw tobacker wont ye i didnt have none so he left i went to the raft and set down in the wigwam to think but i couldnt come to nothing i thought till i wore my head sore but i couldnt see no way out of the trouble after all this long journey and after all wed done for them scoundrels here it was all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined because they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that and make him a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for forty dirty dollars once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to be a slave at home where his family was as long as hed got to be a slave and so id better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss watson where he was but i soon give up that notion for two things shed be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her and so shed sell him straight down the river again and if she didnt everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger and theyd make jim feel it all the time and so hed feel ornery and disgraced and then think of me it would get all around that huck finn helped a nigger to get his freedom and if i was ever to see anybody from that town again id be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame thats just the way a person does a low down thing and then he dont want to take no consequences of it thinks as long as he can hide it it aint no disgrace that was my fix exactly the more i studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me and the more wicked and low down and ornery i got to feeling and at last when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven whilst i was stealing a poor old womans nigger that hadnt ever done me no harm and now was showing me theres one thats always on the lookout and aint a going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further i most dropped in my tracks i was so scared well i tried the best i could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying i was brung up wicked and so i warnt so much to blame but something inside of me kept saying there was the sunday school you could a gone to it and if youd a done it theyd a learnt you there that people that acts as id been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire it made me shiver and i about made up my mind to pray and see if i couldnt try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better so i kneeled down but the words wouldnt come why wouldnt they it warnt no use to try and hide it from him nor from me neither i knowed very well why they wouldnt come it was because my heart warnt right it was because i warnt square it was because i was playing double i was letting on to give up sin but away inside of me i was holding on to the biggest one of all i was trying to make my mouth say i would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that niggers owner and tell where he was but deep down in me i knowed it was a lie and he knowed it you cant pray a lie i found that out so i was full of trouble full as i could be and didnt know what to do at last i had an idea and i says i ll go and write the letter and then see if i can pray why it was astonishing the way i felt as light as a feather right straight off and my troubles all gone so i got a piece of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set down and wrote miss watson your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below pikesville and mr phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send huck finn i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever felt so in my life and i knowed i could pray now but i didnt do it straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinking thinking how good it was all this happened so and how near i come to being lost and going to hell and went on thinking and got to thinking over our trip down the river and i see jim before me all the time in the day and in the night time sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and we a floating along talking and singing and laughing but somehow i couldnt seem to strike no places to harden me against him but only the other kind id see him standing my watch on top of hisn stead of calling me so i could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was when i come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swamp up there where the feud was and such like times and would always call me honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and how good he always was and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling the men we had small pox aboard and he was so grateful and said i was the best friend old jim ever had in the world and the only one hes got now and then i happened to look around and see that paper it was a close place i took it up and held it in my hand i was a trembling because id got to decide forever betwixt two things and i knowed it i studied a minute sort of holding my breath and then says to myself all right then i ll go to hell and tore it up it was awful thoughts and awful words but they was said and i let them stay said and never thought no more about reforming i shoved the whole thing out of my head and said i would take up wickedness again which was in my line being brung up to it and the other warnt and for a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery again and if i could think up anything worse i would do that too because as long as i was in and in for good i might as well go the whole hog then i set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind and at last fixed up a plan that suited me so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my raft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in i slept the night through and got up before it was light and had my breakfast and put on my store clothes and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore i landed below where i judged was phelpss place and hid my bundle in the woods and then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where i could find her again when i wanted her about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank then i struck up the road and when i passed the mill i see a sign on it phelpss sawmill and when i come to the farm houses two or three hundred yards further along i kept my eyes peeled but didnt see nobody around though it was good daylight now but i didnt mind because i didnt want to see nobody just yet i only wanted to get the lay of the land according to my plan i was going to turn up there from the village not from below so i just took a look and shoved along straight for town well the very first man i see when i got there was the duke he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuch three night performance like that other time they had the cheek them frauds i was right on him before i could shirk he looked astonished and says hel lo whered you come from then he says kind of glad and eager wheres the raft got her in a good place i says why thats just what i was going to ask your grace then he didnt look so joyful and says what was your idea for asking me he says well i says when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i says to myself we cant get him home for hours till hes soberer so i went a loafing around town to put in the time and wait a man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep and so i went along but when we was dragging him to the boat and the man left me a holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we after him we didnt have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out we never got him till dark then we fetched him over and i started down for the raft when i got there and see it was gone i says to myself they ve got into trouble and had to leave and they ve took my nigger which is the only nigger i ve got in the world and now im in a strange country and aint got no property no more nor nothing and no way to make my living so i set down and cried i slept in the woods all night but what did become of the raft then and jim poor jim blamed if i know that is whats become of the raft that old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half dollars with him and got every cent but what hed spent for whisky and when i got him home late last night and found the raft gone we said that little rascal has stole our raft and shook us and run off down the river i wouldnt shake my nigger would i the only nigger i had in the world and the only property we never thought of that fact is i reckon wed come to consider him our nigger yes we did consider him so goodness knows we had trouble enough for him so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke there warnt anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch another shake and i ve pegged along ever since dry as a powder horn wheres that ten cents give it here i had considerable money so i give him ten cents but begged him to spend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all the money i had and i hadnt had nothing to eat since yesterday he never said nothing the next minute he whirls on me and says do you reckon that nigger would blow on us wed skin him if he done that how can he blow haint he run off no that old fool sold him and never divided with me and the moneys gone sold him i says and begun to cry why he was my nigger and that was my money where is he i want my nigger well you cant get your nigger thats all so dry up your blubbering looky here do you think youd venture to blow on us blamed if i think id trust you why if you was to blow on us he stopped but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before i went on a whimpering and says i dont want to blow on nobody and i aint got no time to blow nohow i got to turn out and find my nigger he looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead at last he says i ll tell you something we got to be here three days if you ll promise you wont blow and wont let the nigger blow i ll tell you where to find him so i promised and he says a farmer by the name of silas ph and then he stopped you see he started to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun to study and think again i reckoned he was changing his mind and so he was he wouldnt trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days so pretty soon he says the man that bought him is named abram foster abram g foster and he lives forty mile back here in the country on the road to lafayette all right i says i can walk it in three days and i ll start this very afternoon no you wont you ll start now and dont you lose any time about it neither nor do any gabbling by the way just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along and then you wont get into trouble with usd ye hear that was the order i wanted and that was the one i played for i wanted to be left free to work my plans so clear out he says and you can tell mr foster whatever you want to maybe you can get him to believe that jim is your nigger some idiots dont require documents leastways i ve heard theres such down south here and when you tell him the handbill and the rewards bogus maybe he ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting em out go long now and tell him anything you want to but mind you dont work your jaw any between here and there so i left and struck for the back country i didnt look around but i kinder felt like he was watching me but i knowed i could tire him out at that i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before i stopped then i doubled back through the woods towards phelps i reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around because i wanted to stop jims mouth till these fellows could get away i didnt want no trouble with their kind id seen all i wanted to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of them chapter xxxii when i got there it was all still and sunday like and hot and sunshiny the hands was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybodys dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like its spirits whispering spirits thats been dead ever so many years and you always think they re talking about you as a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead too and done with it all phelps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike a rail fence round a two acre yard a stile made out of logs sawed off and up ended in steps like barrels of a different length to climb over the fence with and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse some sickly grass patches in the big yard but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with the nap rubbed off big double log house for the white folks hewed logs with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mud stripes been whitewashed some time or another round log kitchen with a big broad open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smoke house back of the kitchen three little log nigger cabins in a row t other side the smoke house one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ash hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench by the kitchen door with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep there in the sun more hounds asleep round about about three shade trees away off in a corner some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch then the cotton fields begins and after the fields the woods i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen when i got a little ways i heard the dim hum of a spinning wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again and then i knowed for certain i wished i was dead for that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world i went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trusting to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come for id noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if i left it alone when i got half way first one hound and then another got up and went for me and of course i stopped and faced them and kept still and such another powwow as they made in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a hub of a wheel as you may say spokes made out of dogs circle of fifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and noses stretched up towards me a barking and howling and more a coming you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres a nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling pin in her hand singing out begone you tige you spot begone sah and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling and then the rest followed and the next second half of them come back wagging their tails around me and making friends with me there aint no harm in a hound nohow and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow linen shirts and they hung on to their mothers gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the way they always do and here comes the white woman running from the house about forty five or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinning stick in her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting the same way the little niggers was doing she was smiling all over so she could hardly stand and says its you at last aint it i out with a yesm before i thought she grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook and the tears come in her eyes and run down over and she couldnt seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying you dont look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would but law sakes i dont care for that im so glad to see you dear dear it does seem like i could eat you up children its your cousin tom tell him howdy but they ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths and hid behind her so she run on lize hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away or did you get your breakfast on the boat i said i had got it on the boat so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after when we got there she set me down in a split bottomed chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says now i can have a good look at you and laws a me i ve been hungry for it a many and a many a time all these long years and its come at last we been expecting you a couple of days and more what kep you boat get aground yesm she dont say yesm say aunt sally whered she get aground i didnt rightly know what to say because i didnt know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down but i go a good deal on instinct and my instinct said she would be coming up from down towards orleans that didnt help me much though for i didnt know the names of bars down that way i see id got to invent a bar or forget the name of the one we got aground on or now i struck an idea and fetched it out it warnt the grounding that didnt keep us back but a little we blowed out a cylinder head good gracious anybody hurt nom killed a nigger well its lucky because sometimes people do get hurt two years ago last christmas your uncle silas was coming up from newrleans on the old lally rook and she blowed out a cylinder head and crippled a man and i think he died afterwards he was a baptist your uncle silas knowed a family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well yes i remember now he did die mortification set in and they had to amputate him but it didnt save him yes it was mortification that was it he turned blue all over and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection they say he was a sight to look at your uncles been up to the town every day to fetch you and hes gone again not moren an hour ago he ll be back any minute now you must a met him on the road didnt you oldish man with a no i didnt see nobody aunt sally the boat landed just at daylight and i left my baggage on the wharf boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country to put in the time and not get here too soon and so i come down the back way whod you give the baggage to nobody why child it ll be stole not where i hid it i reckon it wont i says howd you get your breakfast so early on the boat it was kinder thin ice but i says the captain see me standing around and told me i better have something to eat before i went ashore so he took me in the texas to the officers lunch and give me all i wanted i was getting so uneasy i couldnt listen good i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was but i couldnt get no show mrs phelps kept it up and run on so pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back because she says but here we re a running on this way and you haint told me a word about sis nor any of them now i ll rest my works a little and you start up yourn just tell me everything tell me all aboutm all every one ofm and how they are and what they re doing and what they told you to tell me and every last thing you can think of well i see i was up a stump and up it good providence had stood by me this fur all right but i was hard and tight aground now i see it warnt a bit of use to try to go ahead id got to throw up my hand so i says to myself heres another place where i got to resk the truth i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes stick your head down lower there that ll do you cant be seen now dont you let on you re here i ll play a joke on him children dont you say a word i see i was in a fix now but it warnt no use to worry there warnt nothing to do but just hold still and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck i had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in then the bed hid him mrs phelps she jumps for him and says has he come no says her husband good ness gracious she says what in the warld can have become of him i cant imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy uneasy she says im ready to go distracted he must a come and you ve missed him along the road i know its so something tells me so why sally i couldnt miss him along the road you know that but oh dear dear what will sis say he must a come you must a missed him he oh dont distress me any moren im already distressed i dont know what in the world to make of it im at my wits end and i dont mind acknowledgingt im right down scared but theres no hope that hes come for he couldnt come and me miss him sally its terrible just terrible somethings happened to the boat sure why silas look yonder up the road aint that somebody coming he sprung to the window at the head of the bed and that give mrs phelps the chance she wanted she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull and out i come and when he turned back from the window there she stood a beaming and a smiling like a house afire and i standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside the old gentleman stared and says why whos that who do you reckont is i haint no idea who is it its tom sawyer by jings i most slumped through the floor but there warnt no time to swap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept on shaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry and then how they both did fire off questions about sid and mary and the rest of the tribe but if they was joyful it warnt nothing to what i was for it was like being born again i was so glad to find out who i was well they froze to me for two hours and at last when my chin was so tired it couldnt hardly go any more i had told them more about my family i mean the sawyer family than ever happened to any six sawyer families and i explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder head at the mouth of white river and it took us three days to fix it which was all right and worked first rate because they didnt know but what it would take three days to fix it if id a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and pretty uncomfortable all up the other being tom sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river then i says to myselfs pose tom sawyer comes down on that boat and s pose he steps in here any minute and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep quiet well i couldnt have it that way it wouldnt do at all i must go up the road and waylay him so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage the old gentleman was for going along with me but i said no i could drive the horse myself and i druther he wouldnt take no trouble about me chapter xxxiii so i started for town in the wagon and when i was half way i see a wagon coming and sure enough it was tom sawyer and i stopped and waited till he come along i says hold on and it stopped alongside and his mouth opened up like a trunk and stayed so and he swallowed two or three times like a person thats got a dry throat and then says i haint ever done you no harm you know that so then what you want to come back and ha nt me for i says i haint come back i haint been gone when he heard my voice it righted him up some but he warnt quite satisfied yet he says dont you play nothing on me because i wouldnt on you honest injun now you aint a ghost honest injun i aint i says well i i well that ought to settle it of course but i cant somehow seem to understand it no way looky here warnt you ever murdered at all no i warnt ever murdered at all i played it on them you come in here and feel of me if you dont believe me so he done it and it satisfied him and he was that glad to see me again he didnt know what to do and he wanted to know all about it right off because it was a grand adventure and mysterious and so it hit him where he lived but i said leave it alone till by and by and told his driver to wait and we drove off a little piece and i told him the kind of a fix i was in and what did he reckon we better do he said let him alone a minute and dont disturb him so he thought and thought and pretty soon he says its all right i ve got it take my trunk in your wagon and let on its yourn and you turn back and fool along slow so as to get to the house about the time you ought to and i ll go towards town a piece and take a fresh start and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you and you neednt let on to know me at first i says all right but wait a minute theres one more thing a thing that nobody dont know but me and that is theres a nigger here that im a trying to steal out of slavery and his name is jim old miss watsons jim he says what why jim is he stopped and went to studying i says i know what you ll say you ll say its dirty low down business but what if it is im low down and im a going to steal him and i want you keep mum and not let on will you his eye lit up and he says i ll help you steal him well i let go all holts then like i was shot it was the most astonishing speech i ever heard and im bound to say tom sawyer fell considerable in my estimation only i couldnt believe it tom sawyer a nigger stealer oh shucks i says you re joking i aint joking either well then i says joking or no joking if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger dont forget to remember that you dont know nothing about him and i dont know nothing about him then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon and he drove off his way and i drove mine but of course i forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking so i got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip the old gentleman was at the door and he says why this is wonderful whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it i wish wed a timed her and she haint sweated a hair not a hair its wonderful why i wouldnt take a hundred dollars for that horse now i wouldnt honest and yet id a sold her for fifteen before and thought twas all she was worth thats all he said he was the innocentest best old soul i ever see but it warnt surprising because he warnt only just a farmer he was a preacher too and had a little one horse log church down back of the plantation which he built it himself at his own expense for a church and schoolhouse and never charged nothing for his preaching and it was worth it too there was plenty other farmer preachers like that and done the same way down south in about half an hour toms wagon drove up to the front stile and aunt sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty yards and says why theres somebody come i wonder who tis why i do believe its a stranger jimmy thats one of the children run and tell lize to put on another plate for dinner everybody made a rush for the front door because of course a stranger dont come every year and so he lays over the yaller fever for interest when he does come tom was over the stile and starting for the house the wagon was spinning up the road for the village and we was all bunched in the front door tom had his store clothes on and an audience and that was always nuts for tom sawyer in them circumstances it warnt no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable he warnt a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep no he come cam and important like the ram when he got a front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didnt want to disturb them and says mr archibald nichols i presume no my boy says the old gentleman im sorry to sayt your driver has deceived you nicholss place is down a matter of three mile more come in come in tom he took a look back over his shoulder and says too late hes out of sight yes hes gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner with us and then we ll hitch up and take you down to nicholss oh i cant make you so much trouble i couldnt think of it i ll walk i dont mind the distance but we wont let you walk it wouldnt be southern hospitality to do it come right in oh do says aunt sally it aint a bit of trouble to us not a bit in the world you must stay its a long dusty three mile and we cant let you walk and besides i ve already told em to put on another plate when i see you coming so you mustnt disappoint us come right in and make yourself at home so tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome and let himself be persuaded and come in and when he was in he said he was a stranger from hicksville ohio and his name was william thompson and he made another bow well he run on and on and on making up stuff about hicksville and everybody in it he could invent and i getting a little nervious and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape and at last still talking along he reached over and kissed aunt sally right on the mouth and then settled back again in his chair comfortable and was going on talking but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand and says you owdacious puppy he looked kind of hurt and says im surprised at youm am you re s rp why what do you reckon i am i ve a good notion to take and say what do you mean by kissing me he looked kind of humble and says i didnt mean nothingm am i didnt mean no harm i i thought youd like it why you born fool she took up the spinning stick and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it what made you think id like it well i dont know only they they told me you would they told you i would whoever told yous another lunatic i never heard the beat of it whos they why everybody they all said som am it was all she could do to hold in and her eyes snapped and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him and she says whos everybody out with their names or ther ll be an idiot short he got up and looked distressed and fumbled his hat and says im sorry and i warnt expecting it they told me to they all told me to they all said kiss her and said shed like it they all said it every one of them but im sorrym am and i wont do it no more i wont honest you wont wont you well i shd reckon you wont nom im honest about it i wont ever do it again till you ask me till i ask you well i never see the beat of it in my born days i lay you ll be the methusalem numskull of creation before ever i ask you or the likes of you well he says it does surprise me so i cant make it out somehow they said you would and i thought you would but he stopped and looked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres and fetched up on the old gentlemans and says didnt you think shed like me to kiss her sir why no i i well no i b lieve i didnt then he looks on around the same way to me and says tom didnt you think aunt sallyd open out her arms and say sid sawyer my land she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudent young rascal to fool a body so and was going to hug him but he fended her off and says no not till you ve asked me first so she didnt lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissed him over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and he took what was left and after they got a little quiet again she says why dear me i never see such a surprise we warnt looking for you at all but only tom sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him its because it warnt intended for any of us to come but tom he says but i begged and begged and at the last minute she let me come too so coming down the river me and tom thought it would be a first rate surprise for him to come here to the house first and for me to by and by tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger but it was a mistake aunt sally this aint no healthy place for a stranger to come no not impudent whelps sid you ought to had your jaws boxed i haint been so put out since i dont know when but i dont care i dont mind the terms id be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here well to think of that performance i dont deny it i was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack we had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen and there was things enough on that table for seven families and all hot too none of your flabby tough meat thats laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning uncle silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it but it was worth it and it didnt cool it a bit neither the way i ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times there was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and me and tom was on the lookout all the time but it warnt no use they didnt happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraid to try to work up to it but at supper at night one of the little boys says pa maynt tom and sid and me go to the show no says the old man i reckon there aint going to be any and you couldnt go if there was because the runaway nigger told burton and me all about that scandalous show and burton said he would tell the people so i reckon they ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time so there it was but i couldnt help it tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed so being tired we bid good night and went up to bed right after supper and clumb out of the window and down the lightning rod and shoved for the town for i didnt believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint and so if i didnt hurry up and give them one theyd get into trouble sure on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered and how pap disappeared pretty soon and didnt come back no more and what a stir there was when jim run away and i told tom all about our royal nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as i had time to and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it it was as much as half after eight then here comes a raging rush of people with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging tin pans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let them go by and as they went by i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail that is i knowed it was the king and the duke though they was all over tar and feathers and didnt look like nothing in the world that was human just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier plumes well it made me sick to see it and i was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals it seemed like i couldnt ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world it was a dreadful thing to see human beings can be awful cruel to one another we see we was too late couldnt do no good we asked some stragglers about it and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal and the house rose up and went for them so we poked along back home and i warnt feeling so brash as i was before but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehow though i hadnt done nothing but thats always the way it dont make no difference whether you do right or wrong a persons conscience aint got no sense and just goes for him anyway if i had a yaller dog that didnt know no more than a persons conscience does i would pison him it takes up more room than all the rest of a persons insides and yet aint no good nohow tom sawyer he says the same chapter xxxiv we stopped talking and got to thinking by and by tom says looky here huck what fools we are to not think of it before i bet i know where jim is no where in that hut down by the ash hopper why looky here when we was at dinner didnt you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles yes what did you think the vittles was for for a dog sod i well it wasnt for a dog why because part of it was watermelon so it was i noticed it well it does beat all that i never thought about a dog not eating watermelon it shows how a body can see and dont see at the same time well the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked it again when he came out he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table same key i bet watermelon shows man lock shows prisoner and it aint likely theres two prisoners on such a little plantation and where the peoples all so kind and good jims the prisoner all right im glad we found it out detective fashion i wouldnt give shucks for any other way now you work your mind and study out a plan to steal jim and i will study out one too and we ll take the one we like the best what a head for just a boy to have if i had tom sawyers head i wouldnt trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in a circus nor nothing i can think of i went to thinking out a plan but only just to be doing something i knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from pretty soon tom says ready yes i says all right bring it out my plan is this i says we can easy find out if its jim in there then get up my canoe to morrow night and fetch my raft over from the island then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old mans britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the river on the raft with jim hiding daytimes and running nights the way me and jim used to do before wouldnt that plan work work why cert nly it would work like rats a fighting but its too blame simple there aint nothing to it whats the good of a plan that aint no more trouble than that its as mild as goose milk why huck it wouldnt make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory i never said nothing because i warnt expecting nothing different but i knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldnt have none of them objections to it and it didnt he told me what it was and i see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style and would make jim just as free a man as mine would and maybe get us all killed besides so i was satisfied and said we would waltz in on it i neednt tell what it was here because i knowed it wouldnt stay the way it was i knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance and that is what he done well one thing was dead sure and that was that tom sawyer was in earnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery that was the thing that was too many for me here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks at home that had characters and he was bright and not leather headed and knowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he was without any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop to this business and make himself a shame and his family a shame before everybody i couldnt understand it no way at all it was outrageous and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so and so be his true friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself and i did start to tell him but he shut me up and says dont you reckon i know what im about dont i generly know what im about yes didnt i say i was going to help steal the nigger yes well then thats all he said and thats all i said it warnt no use to say any more because when he said hed do a thing he always done it but i couldnt make out how he was willing to go into this thing so i just let it go and never bothered no more about it if he was bound to have it so i couldnt help it when we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down to the hut by the ash hopper for to examine it we went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do they knowed us and didnt make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides and on the side i warnt acquainted with which was the north side we found a square window hole up tolerable high with just one stout board nailed across it i says heres the ticket this holes big enough for jim to get through if we wrench off the board tom says its as simple as tit tat toe three in a row and as easy as playing hooky i should hope we can find a way thats a little more complicated than that huck finn well then i says how ll it do to saw him out the way i done before i was murdered that time thats more like he says its real mysterious and troublesome and good he says but i bet we can find a way thats twice as long there aint no hurry les keep on looking around betwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a lean to that joined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank it was as long as the hut but narrow only about six foot wide the door to it was at the south end and was padlocked tom he went to the soap kettle and searched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with so he took it and prized out one of the staples the chain fell down and we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadnt no connection with it and there warnt no floor to the shed nor nothing in it but some old rusty played out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow the match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again and the door was locked as good as ever tom was joyful he says now we re all right we ll dig him out it ll take about a week then we started for the house and i went in the back door you only have to pull a buckskin latch string they dont fasten the doors but that warnt romantical enough for tom sawyer no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning rod but after he got up half way about three times and missed fire and fell every time and the last time most busted his brains out he thought hed got to give it up but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and this time he made the trip in the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jim if it was jim that was being fed the niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields and jims nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things and whilst the others was leaving the key come from the house this nigger had a good natured chuckle headed face and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread that was to keep witches off he said the witches was pestering him awful these nights and making him see all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds of strange words and noises and he didnt believe he was ever witched so long before in his life he got so worked up and got to running on so about his troubles he forgot all about what hed been a going to do so tom says whats the vittles for going to feed the dogs the nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when you heave a brickbat in a mud puddle and he says yes mars sid a dog cur us dog too does you want to go en look at im yes i hunched tom and whispers you going right here in the daybreak that warnt the plan no it warnt but its the plan now so drat him we went along but i didnt like it much when we got in we couldnt hardly see anything it was so dark but jim was there sure enough and could see us and he sings out why huck en good lan ain dat misto tom i just knowed how it would be i just expected it i didnt know nothing to do and if i had i couldnt a done it because that nigger busted in and says why de gracious sakes do he know you genlmen we could see pretty well now tom he looked at the nigger steady and kind of wondering and says does who know us why dis yer runaway nigger i dont reckon he does but what put that into your head what put it dar didn he jis dis minute sing out like he knowed you tom says in a puzzled up kind of way well thats mighty curious who sung out when did he sing out what did he sing out and turns to me perfectly cam and says did you hear anybody sing out of course there warnt nothing to be said but the one thing so i says no i aint heard nobody say nothing then he turns to jim and looks him over like he never see him before and says did you sing out no sah says jim i haint said nothing sah not a word no sah i haint said a word did you ever see us before no sah not as i knows on so tom turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed and says kind of severe what do you reckons the matter with you anyway what made you think somebody sung out oh its de dad blame witches sah en i wisht i was dead i do deys awluz at it sah en dey do mos kill me dey sk yers me so please to dont tell nobody bout it sah er ole mars silas he ll scole me kase he say dey aint no witches i jis wish to goodness he was heah now den what would he say i jis bet he couldn fine no way to git aroun it dis time but its awluz jis so people dats sot stays sot dey wont look into nothn en fine it out fr deyselves en when you fine it out en tell um bout it dey doanb lieve you tom give him a dime and said we wouldnt tell nobody and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at jim and says i wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger if i was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away i wouldnt give him up id hang him and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to jim and says dont ever let on to know us and if you hear any digging going on nights its us we re going to set you free jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the nigger come back and we said wed come again some time if the nigger wanted us to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because the witches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folks around then chapter xxxv it would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down into the woods because tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into trouble what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks thats called fox fire and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place we fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set down to rest and tom says kind of dissatisfied blame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan there aint no watchman to be drugged now there ought to be a watchman there aint even a dog to give a sleeping mixture to and theres jim chained by one leg with a ten foot chain to the leg of his bed why all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain and uncle silas he trusts everybody sends the key to the punkin headed nigger and dont send nobody to watch the nigger jim could a got out of that window hole before this only there wouldnt be no use trying to travel with a ten foot chain on his leg why drat it huck its the stupidest arrangement i ever see you got to invent all the difficulties well we cant help it we got to do the best we can with the materials we ve got anyhow theres one thing theres more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers where there warnt one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them and you had to contrive them all out of your own head now look at just that one thing of the lantern when you come down to the cold facts we simply got to let on that a lanterns resky why we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to i believe now whilst i think of it we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get what do we want of a saw what do we want of it haint we got to saw the leg of jims bed off so as to get the chain loose why you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off well if that aint just like you huck finn you can get up the infant schooliest ways of going at a thing why haint you ever read any books at all baron trenck nor casanova nor benvenuto chelleeny nor henri iv nor none of them heroes who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old maidy way as that no the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed leg in two and leave it just so and swallow the sawdust so it cant be found and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal cant see no sign of its being sawed and thinks the bed leg is perfectly sound then the night you re ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slip off your chain and there you are nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in the moat because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you know and theres your horses and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle and away you go to your native langudoc or navarre or wherever it is its gaudy huck i wish there was a moat to this cabin if we get time the night of the escape we ll dig one i says what do we want of a moat when we re going to snake him out from under the cabin but he never heard me he had forgot me and everything else he had his chin in his hand thinking pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head then sighs again and says no it wouldnt do there aint necessity enough for it for what i says why to saw jims leg off he says good land i says why there aint no necessity for it and what would you want to saw his leg off for anyway well some of the best authorities has done it they couldnt get the chain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved and a leg would be better still but we got to let that go there aint necessity enough in this case and besides jims a nigger and wouldnt understand the reasons for it and how its the custom in europe so we ll let it go but theres one thing he can have a rope ladder we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough and we can send it to him in a pie its mostly done that way and i ve et worse pies why tom sawyer how you talk i says jim aint got no use for a rope ladder he has got use for it how you talk you better say you dont know nothing about it hes got to have a rope ladder they all do what in the nation can he do with it do with it he can hide it in his bed cant he thats what they all do and hes got to too huck you dont ever seem to want to do anything thats regular you want to be starting something fresh all the times pose he dont do nothing with it aint it there in his bed for a clew after hes gone and dont you reckon they ll want clews of course they will and you wouldnt leave them any that would be a pretty howdy do wouldnt it i never heard of such a thing well i says if its in the regulations and hes got to have it all right let him have it because i dont wish to go back on no regulations but theres one thing tom sawyer if we go to tearing up our sheets to make jim a rope ladder we re going to get into trouble with aunt sally just as sure as you re born now the way i look at it a hickry bark ladder dont cost nothing and dont waste nothing and is just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as any rag ladder you can start and as for jim he aint had no experience and so he dont care what kind of a oh shucks huck finn if i was as ignorant as you id keep still thats what id do who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry bark ladder why its perfectly ridiculous well all right tom fix it your own way but if you ll take my advice you ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline he said that would do and that gave him another idea and he says borrow a shirt too what do we want of a shirt tom want it for jim to keep a journal on journal your granny jim cant write s pose he cant write he can make marks on the shirt cant he if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel hoop why tom we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one and quicker too prisoners dont have geese running around the donjon keep to pull pens out of you muggins they always make their pens out of the hardest toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out too because they ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall they wouldnt use a goose quill if they had it it aint regular well then what ll we make him the ink out of many makes it out of iron rust and tears but thats the common sort and women the best authorities uses their own blood jim can do that and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where hes captivated he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window the iron mask always done that and its a blame good way too jim aint got no tin plates they feed him in a pan that aint nothing we can get him some cant nobody read his plates that aint got anything to do with it huck finn all hes got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out you dont have to be able to read it why half the time you cant read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate or anywhere else well then whats the sense in wasting the plates why blame it all it aint the prisoners plates but its somebodys plates aint it well sposn it is what does the prisoner care whose he broke off there because we heard the breakfast horn blowing so we cleared out for the house along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes line and i found an old sack and put them in it and we went down and got the fox fire and put that in too i called it borrowing because that was what pap always called it but tom said it warnt borrowing it was stealing he said we was representing prisoners and prisoners dont care how they get a thing so they get it and nobody dont blame them for it either it aint no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with tom said its his right and so as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with he said if we warnt prisoners it would be a very different thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal when he warnt a prisoner so we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy and yet he made a mighty fuss one day after that when i stole a watermelon out of the nigger patch and eat it and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for tom said that what he meant was we could steal anything we needed well i says i needed the watermelon but he said i didnt need it to get out of prison with theres where the difference was he said if id a wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to jim to kill the seneskal with it would a been all right so i let it go at that though i couldnt see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold leaf distinctions like that every time i see a chance to hog a watermelon well as i was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business and nobody in sight around the yard then tom he carried the sack into the lean to whilst i stood off a piece to keep watch by and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk he says everythings all right now except tools and thats easy fixed tools i says yes tools for what why to dig with we aint a going to gnaw him out are we aint them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with i says he turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and says huck finn did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with now i want to ask you if you got any reasonableness in you at all what kind of a show would that give him to be a hero why they might as well lend him the key and done with it picks and shovels why they wouldnt furnish em to a king well then i says if we dont want the picks and shovels what do we want a couple of case knives to dig the foundations out from under that cabin with yes confound it its foolish tom it dont make no difference how foolish it is its the right way and its the regular way and there aint no other way that ever i heard of and i ve read all the books that gives any information about these things they always dig out with a case knife and not through dirt mind you generly its through solid rock and it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks and for ever and ever why look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the castle deef in the harbor of marseilles that dug himself out that way how long was he at it you reckon i dont know well guess i dont know a month and a half thirty seven year and he come out in china thats the kind i wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock jim dont know nobody in china whats that got to do with it neither did that other fellow but you re always a wandering off on a side issue why cant you stick to the main point all right i dont care where he comes out so he comes out and jim dont either i reckon but theres one thing anyway jims too old to be dug out with a case knife he wont last yes he will last too you dont reckon its going to take thirty seven years to dig out through a dirt foundation do you how long will it take tom well we cant resk being as long as we ought to because it maynt take very long for uncle silas to hear from down there by new orleans he ll hear jim aint from there then his next move will be to advertise jim or something like that so we cant resk being as long digging him out as we ought to by rights i reckon we ought to be a couple of years but we cant things being so uncertain what i recommend is this that we really dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can let on to ourselves that we was at it thirty seven years then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time theres an alarm yes i reckon that ll be the best way now theres sense in that i says letting on dont cost nothing letting on aint no trouble and if its any object i dont mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year it wouldnt strain me none after i got my hand in so i ll mosey along now and smouch a couple of case knives smouch three he says we want one to make a saw out of tom if it aint unregular and irreligious to sejest it i says theres an old rusty saw blade around yonder sticking under the weather boarding behind the smoke house he looked kind of weary and discouraged like and says it aint no use to try to learn you nothing huck run along and smouch the knives three of them so i done it chapter xxxvi as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning rod and shut ourselves up in the lean to and got out our pile of fox fire and went to work we cleared everything out of the way about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log tom said he was right behind jims bed now and wed dig in under it and when we got through there couldnt nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there because jims counter pin hung down most to the ground and youd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole so we dug and dug with the case knives till most midnight and then we was dog tired and our hands was blistered and yet you couldnt see wed done anything hardly at last i says this aint no thirty seven year job this is a thirty eight year job tom sawyer he never said nothing but he sighed and pretty soon he stopped digging and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking then he says it aint no use huck it aint a going to work if we was prisoners it would because then wed have as many years as we wanted and no hurry and we wouldnt get but a few minutes to dig every day while they was changing watches and so our hands wouldnt get blistered and we could keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the way it ought to be done but we cant fool along we got to rush we aint got no time to spare if we was to put in another night this way wed have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well couldnt touch a case knife with them sooner well then what we going to do tom i ll tell you it aint right and it aint moral and i wouldnt like it to get out but there aint only just the one way we got to dig him out with the picks and let on its case knives now you re talking i says your head gets leveler and leveler all the time tom sawyer i says picks is the thing moral or no moral and as for me i dont care shucks for the morality of it nohow when i start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a sunday school book i aint no ways particular how its done so its done what i want is my nigger or what i want is my watermelon or what i want is my sunday school book and if a picks the handiest thing thats the thing im a going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sunday school book out with and i dont give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther well he says theres excuse for picks and letting on in a case like this if it warnt so i wouldnt approve of it nor i wouldnt stand by and see the rules broke because right is right and wrong is wrong and a body aint got no business doing wrong when he aint ignorant and knows better it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pick without any letting on because you dont know no better but it wouldnt for me because i do know better gimme a case knife he had his own by him but i handed him mine he flung it down and says gimme a case knife i didnt know just what to do but then i thought i scratched around amongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he took it and went to work and never said a word he was always just that particular full of principle so then i got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn about and made the fur fly we stuck to it about a half an hour which was as long as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doing his level best with the lightning rod but he couldnt come it his hands was so sore at last he says it aint no use it cant be done what you reckon i better do cant you think of no way yes i says but i reckon it aint regular come up the stairs and let on its a lightning rod so he done it next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house for to make some pens for jim out of and six tallow candles and i hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance and stole three tin plates tom says it wasnt enough but i said nobody wouldnt ever see the plates that jim throwed out because theyd fall in the dog fennel and jimpson weeds under the window hole then we could tote them back and he could use them over again so tom was satisfied then he says now the thing to study out is how to get the things to jim take them in through the hole i says when we get it done he only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying by and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways but there warnt no need to decide on any of them yet said wed got to post jim first that night we went down the lightning rod a little after ten and took one of the candles along and listened under the window hole and heard jim snoring so we pitched it in and it didnt wake him then we whirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hours and a half the job was done we crept in under jims bed and into the cabin and pawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over jim awhile and found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentle and gradual he was so glad to see us he most cried and called us honey and all the pet names he could think of and was for having us hunt up a cold chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away and clearing out without losing any time but tom he showed him how unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plans and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm and not to be the least afraid because we would see he got away sure so jim he said it was all right and we set there and talked over old times awhile and then tom asked a lot of questions and when jim told him uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him and aunt sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat and both of them was kind as they could be tom says now i know how to fix it we ll send you some things by them i said dont do nothing of the kind its one of the most jackass ideas i ever struck but he never paid no attention to me went right on it was his way when hed got his plans set so he told jim how wed have to smuggle in the rope ladder pie and other large things by nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the lookout and not be surprised and not let nat see him open them and we would put small things in uncles coat pockets and he must steal them out and we would tie things to aunts apron strings or put them in her apron pocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be and what they was for and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood and all that he told him everything jim he couldnt see no sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all just as tom said jim had plenty corn cob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down good sociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home to bed with hands that looked like theyd been chawed tom was in high spirits he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and the most intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children to get out for he believed jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it he said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year and would be the best time on record and he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes and tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket then we went to the nigger cabins and while i got nats notice off tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn pone that was in jims pan and we went along with nat to see how it would work and it just worked noble when jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out and there warnt ever anything could a worked better tom said so himself jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that thats always getting into bread you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first and whilst we was a standing there in the dimmish light here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under jims bed and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them and there warnt hardly room in there to get your breath by jings we forgot to fasten that lean to door the nigger nat he only just hollered witches once and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs and begun to groan like he was dying tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jims meat and the dogs went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door and i knowed hed fixed the other door too then he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him and asking him if hed been imagining he saw something again he raised up and blinked his eyes around and says mars sid you ll say is a fool but if i didnt b lieve i see most a million dogs er devils er somen i wisht i may die right heah in dese tracks i did mos sholy mars sid i felt um i felt um sah dey was all over me dad fetch it i jis wisht i could git my hans on one er dem witches jis wunst ony jis wunst its all id ast but mos ly i wisht deyd lemme lone i does tom says well i tell you what i think what makes them come here just at this runaway niggers breakfast time its because they re hungry thats the reason you make them a witch pie thats the thing for you to do but my lan mars sid hows i gwyne to makem a witch pie i doan know how to make it i haint ever hearn er sich a thing b fo well then i ll have to make it myself will you do it honey will you i ll wusshup de groun und yo foot i will all right i ll do it seeing its you and you ve been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger but you got to be mighty careful when we come around you turn your back and then whatever we ve put in the pan dont you let on you see it at all and dont you look when jim unloads the pan something might happen i dont know what and above all dont you handle the witch things hannelm mars sid what is you a talkin bout i wouldn lay de weight er my finger on um not fr ten hundd thousn billion dollars i wouldnt chapter xxxvii that was all fixed so then we went away and went to the rubbage pile in the back yard where they keep the old boots and rags and pieces of bottles and wore out tin things and all such truck and scratched around and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well as we could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shingle nails that tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in aunt sallys apron pocket which was hanging on a chair and t other we stuck in the band of uncle silass hat which was on the bureau because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway niggers house this morning and then went to breakfast and tom dropped the pewter spoon in uncle silass coat pocket and aunt sally wasnt come yet so we had to wait a little while and when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldnt hardly wait for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest childs head with her thimble with the other and says i ve hunted high and i ve hunted low and it does beat all what has become of your other shirt my heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things and a hard piece of corn crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing worm and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop and tom he turned kinder blue around the gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that and i would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder but after that we was all right again it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold uncle silas he says its most uncommon curious i cant understand it i know perfectly well i took it off because because you haint got but one on just listen at the man i know you took it off and know it by a better way than your wool gethering memory too because it was on the clos line yesterday i see it there myself but its gone thats the long and the short of it and you ll just have to change to a red flannl one till i can get time to make a new one and it ll be the third i ve made in two years it just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts and whatever you do manage to do withm all is moren i can make out a bodyd think you would learn to take some sort of care of em at your time of life i know it sally and i do try all i can but it oughtnt to be altogether my fault because you know i dont see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they re on me and i dont believe i ve ever lost one of them off of me well it aint your fault if you havent silas youd a done it if you could i reckon and the shirt aint all thats gone nuther thers a spoon gone and that aint all there was ten and now thers only nine the calf got the shirt i reckon but the calf never took the spoon thats certain why what else is gone sally thers six candles gone thats what the rats could a got the candles and i reckon they did i wonder they dont walk off with the whole place the way you re always going to stop their holes and dont do it and if they warnt fools theyd sleep in your hair silas youd never find it out but you cant lay the spoon on the rats and that i know well sally im in fault and i acknowledge it i ve been remiss but i wont let to morrow go by without stopping up them holes oh i wouldnt hurry next year ll do matilda angelina araminta phelps whack comes the thimble and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar bowl without fooling around any just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage and says missus deys a sheet gone a sheet gone well for the lands sake i ll stop up them holes to day says uncle silas looking sorrowful oh do shet ups pose the rats took the sheet wheres it gone lize clah to goodness i haint no notion miss sally she wuz on de clo sline yistiddy but she done gone she ain dah no mo now i reckon the world is coming to an end i never see the beat of it in all my born days a shirt and a sheet and a spoon and six can missus comes a young yaller wench deys a brass cannelstick missn cler out from here you hussy er i ll take a skillet to ye well she was just a biling i begun to lay for a chance i reckoned i would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated she kept a raging right along running her insurrection all by herself and everybody else mighty meek and quiet and at last uncle silas looking kind of foolish fishes up that spoon out of his pocket she stopped with her mouth open and her hands up and as for me i wished i was in jeruslem or somewheres but not long because she says its just as i expected so you had it in your pocket all the time and like as not you ve got the other things there too howd it get there i reely dont know sally he says kind of apologizing or you know i would tell i was a studying over my text in acts seventeen before breakfast and i reckon i put it in there not noticing meaning to put my testament in and it must be so because my testament aint in but i ll go and see and if the testament is where i had it i ll know i didnt put it in and that will show that i laid the testament down and took up the spoon and oh for the lands sake give a body a rest go long now the whole kit and biling of ye and dont come nigh me again till i ve got back my peace of mind id a heard her if shed a said it to herself let alone speaking it out and id a got up and obeyed her if id a been dead as we was passing through the setting room the old man he took up his hat and the shingle nail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel shelf and never said nothing and went out tom see him do it and remembered about the spoon and says well it aint no use to send things by him no more he aint reliable then he says but he done us a good turn with the spoon anyway without knowing it and so we ll go and do him one without him knowing it stop up his rat holes there was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape then we heard steps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comes the old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t other looking as absent minded as year before last he went a mooning around first to one rat hole and then another till hed been to them all then he stood about five minutes picking tallow drip off of his candle and thinking then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs saying well for the life of me i cant remember when i done it i could show her now that i warnt to blame on account of the rats but never mind let it go i reckon it wouldnt do no good and so he went on a mumbling up stairs and then we left he was a mighty nice old man and always is tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he said wed got to have it so he took a think when he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do then we went and waited around the spoon basket till we see aunt sally coming and then tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side and i slid one of them up my sleeve and tom says why aunt sally there aint but nine spoons yet she says go long to your play and dont bother me i know better i counted m myself well i ve counted them twice aunty and i cant make but nine she looked out of all patience but of course she come to count anybody would i declare to gracious ther aint but nine she says why what in the world plague take the things i ll countm again so i slipped back the one i had and when she got done counting she says hang the troublesome rubbage thers ten now and she looked huffy and bothered both but tom says why aunty i dont think theres ten you numskull didnt you see me countm i know but well i ll countm again so i smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time well she was in a tearing way just a trembling all over she was so mad but she counted and counted till she got that addled shed start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three times they come out right and three times they come out wrong then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley west and she said cler out and let her have some peace and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner shed skin us so we had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apron pocket whilst she was a giving us our sailing orders and jim got it all right along with her shingle nail before noon we was very well satisfied with this business and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took because he said now she couldnt ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life and wouldnt believe shed counted them right if she did and said that after shed about counted her head off for the next three days he judged shed give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more so we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out of her closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didnt know how many sheets she had any more and she didnt care and warnt a going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it and wouldnt count them again not to save her life she druther die first so we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed up counting and as to the candlestick it warnt no consequence it would blow over by and by but that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie we fixed it up away down in the woods and cooked it there and we got it done at last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and we had to use up three wash pans full of flour before we got through and we got burnt pretty much all over in places and eyes put out with the smoke because you see we didnt want nothing but a crust and we couldnt prop it up right and she would always cave in but of course we thought of the right way at last which was to cook the ladder too in the pie so then we laid in with jim the second night and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with we let on it took nine months to make it and in the forenoon we took it down to the woods but it wouldnt go into the pie being made of a whole sheet that way there was rope enough for forty pies if wed a wanted them and plenty left over for soup or sausage or anything you choose we could a had a whole dinner but we didnt need it all we needed was just enough for the pie and so we throwed the rest away we didnt cook none of the pies in the wash pan afraid the solder would melt but uncle silas he had a noble brass warming pan which he thought considerable of because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from england with william the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable not on account of being any account because they warnt but on account of them being relicts you know and we snaked her out private and took her down there but she failed on the first pies because we didnt know how but she come up smiling on the last one we took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals and loaded her up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the long handle cool and comfortable and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at but the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that rope ladder wouldnt cramp him down to business i dont know nothing what im talking about and lay him in enough stomach ache to last him till next time too nat didnt look when we put the witch pie in jims pan and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so jim got everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window hole chapter xxxviii making them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all thats the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall but he had to have it tom said hed got to there warnt no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of arms look at lady jane grey he says look at gilford dudley look at old northumberland why hucks pose it is considerble trouble what you going to do how you going to get around it jims got to do his inscription and coat of arms they all do jim says why mars tom i haint got no coat o arm i haint got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat oh you dont understand jim a coat of arms is very different well i says jims right anyway when he says he aint got no coat of arms because he haint i reckon i knowed that tom says but you bet he ll have one before he goes out of this because hes going out right and there aint going to be no flaws in his record so whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece jim a making hisn out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon tom set to work to think out the coat of arms by and by he said hed struck so many good ones he didnt hardly know which to take but there was one which he reckoned hed decide on he says on the scutcheon we ll have a bend or in the dexter base a saltire murrey in the fess with a dog couchant for common charge and under his foot a chain embattled for slavery with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed and three invected lines on a field azure with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented crest a runaway nigger sable with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and a couple of gules for supporters which is you and me motto maggiore fretta minore otto got it out of a book means the more haste the less speed geewhillikins i says but what does the rest of it mean we aint got no time to bother over that he says we got to dig in like all git out well anyway i says whats some of it whats a fess a fess a fess is you dont need to know what a fess is i ll show him how to make it when he gets to it shucks tom i says i think you might tell a person whats a bar sinister oh i dont know but hes got to have it all the nobility does that was just his way if it didnt suit him to explain a thing to you he wouldnt do it you might pump at him a week it wouldnt make no difference hed got all that coat of arms business fixed so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out a mournful inscription said jim got to have one like they all done he made up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so here a captive heart busted here a poor prisoner forsook by the world and friends fretted his sorrowful life here a lonely heart broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirty seven years of solitary captivity here homeless and friendless after thirty seven years of bitter captivity perished a noble stranger natural son of louis xiv toms voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke down when he got done he couldnt no way make up his mind which one for jim to scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail and he didnt know how to make letters besides but tom said he would block them out for him and then he wouldnt have nothing to do but just follow the lines then pretty soon he says come to think the logs aint a going to do they dont have log walls in a dungeon we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock we ll fetch a rock jim said the rock was worse than the logs he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnt ever get out but tom said he would let me help him do it then he took a look to see how me and jim was getting along with the pens it was most pesky tedious hard work and slow and didnt give my hands no show to get well of the sores and we didnt seem to make no headway hardly so tom says i know how to fix it we got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rock theres a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and we ll smouch it and carve the things on it and file out the pens and the saw on it too it warnt no slouch of an idea and it warnt no slouch of a grindstone nuther but we allowed wed tackle it it warnt quite midnight yet so we cleared out for the mill leaving jim at work we smouched the grindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation tough job sometimes do what we could we couldnt keep her from falling over and she come mighty near mashing us every time tom said she was going to get one of us sure before we got through we got her half way and then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat we see it warnt no use we got to go and fetch jim so he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed leg and wrapt it round and round his neck and we crawled out through our hole and down there and jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing and tom superintended he could out superintend any boy i ever see he knowed how to do everything our hole was pretty big but it warnt big enough to get the grindstone through but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough then tom marked out them things on it with the nail and set jim to work on them with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean to for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed leg and was ready for bed ourselves but tom thought of something and says you got any spiders in here jim no sah thanks to goodness i haint mars tom all right we ll get you some but bless you honey i doan want none is afeard un um i jis s soon have rattlesnakes aroun tom thought a minute or two and says its a good idea and i reckon its been done it must a

raise one er dem mullen stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another mans a startn one wid tears that aint the idea you got to do it with tears she ll die on my hans mars tom she sholy will kase i doan skasely ever cry so tom was stumped but he studied it over and then said jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion he promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one private in jims coffee pot in the morning jim said he would jiss soon have tobacker in his coffee and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of raising the mullen and jews harping the rats and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things on top of all the other work he had to do on pens and inscriptions and journals and things which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook that tom most lost all patience with him and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself and yet he didnt know enough to appreciate them and they was just about wasted on him so jim he was sorry and said he wouldnt behave so no more and then me and tom shoved for bed chapter xxxix in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat trap and fetched it down and unstopped the best rat hole and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones and then we took it and put it in a safe place under aunt sallys bed but while we was gone for spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found it there and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out and they did and aunt sally she come in and when we got back she was a standing on top of the bed raising cain and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her so she took and dusted us both with the hickry and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesome cub and they warnt the likeliest nuther because the first haul was the pick of the flock i never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was we got a splendid stock of sorted spiders and bugs and frogs and caterpillars and one thing or another and we like to got a hornets nest but we didnt the family was at home we didnt give it right up but stayed with them as long as we could because we allowed wed tire them out or theyd got to tire us out and they done it then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places and was pretty near all right again but couldnt set down convenient and so we went for the snakes and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house snakes and put them in a bag and put it in our room and by that time it was supper time and a rattling good honest days work and hungry oh no i reckon not and there warnt a blessed snake up there when we went back we didnt half tie the sack and they worked out somehow and left but it didnt matter much because they was still on the premises somewheres so we judged we could get some of them again no there warnt no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell youd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then and they generly landed in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of the time where you didnt want them well they was handsome and striped and there warnt no harm in a million of them but that never made no difference to aunt sally she despised snakes be the breed what they might and she couldnt stand them no way you could fix it and every time one of them flopped down on her it didnt make no difference what she was doing she would just lay that work down and light out i never see such a woman and you could hear her whoop to jericho you couldnt get her to take a holt of one of them with the tongs and if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire she disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadnt ever been no snakes created why after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week aunt sally warnt over it yet she warnt near over it when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings it was very curious but tom said all women was just so he said they was made that way for some reason or other we got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way and she allowed these lickings warnt nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them i didnt mind the lickings because they didnt amount to nothing but i minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot but we got them laid in and all the other things and you never see a cabin as blithesome as jims was when theyd all swarm out for music and go for him jim didnt like the spiders and the spiders didnt like jim and so theyd lay for him and make it mighty warm for him and he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warnt no room in bed for him skasely and when there was a body couldnt sleep it was so lively and it was always lively he said because they never all slept at one time but took turn about so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch so he always had one gang under him in his way and t other gang having a circus over him and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over he said if he ever got out this time he wouldnt ever be a prisoner again not for a salary well by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape the shirt was sent in early in a pie and every time a rat bit jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh the pens was made the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone the bed leg was sawed in two and we had et up the sawdust and it give us a most amazing stomach ache we reckoned we was all going to die but didnt it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever see and tom said the same but as i was saying wed got all the work done now at last and we was all pretty much fagged out too but mainly jim the old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below orleans to come and get their runaway nigger but hadnt got no answer because there warnt no such plantation so he allowed he would advertise jim in the st louis and new orleans papers and when he mentioned the st louis ones it give me the cold shivers and i see we hadnt no time to lose so tom said now for the nonnamous letters whats them i says warnings to the people that something is up sometimes its done one way sometimes another but theres always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle when louis xvi was going to light out of the tooleries a servant girl done it its a very good way and so is the nonnamous letters we ll use them both and its usual for the prisoners mother to change clothes with him and she stays in and he slides out in her clothes we ll do that too but looky here tom what do we want to warn anybody for that somethings up let them find it out for themselves its their lookout yes i know but you cant depend on them its the way they ve acted from the very start left us to do everything they re so confiding and mullet headed they dont take notice of nothing at all so if we dont give them notice there wont be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ll go off perfectly flat wont amount to nothing wont be nothing to it well as for me tom thats the way id like shucks he says and looked disgusted so i says but i aint going to make no complaint any way that suits you suits me what you going to do about the servant girl you ll be her you slide in in the middle of the night and hook that yaller girls frock why tom that ll make trouble next morning because of course she prob bly haint got any but that one i know but you dont want it but fifteen minutes to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door all right then i ll do it but i could carry it just as handy in my own togs you wouldnt look like a servant girl then would you no but there wont be nobody to see what i look like anyway that aint got nothing to do with it the thing for us to do is just to do our duty and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not haint you got no principle at all all right i aint saying nothing im the servant girl whos jims mother im his mother i ll hook a gown from aunt sally well then you ll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leaves not much i ll stuff jims clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise and jim ll take the nigger womans gown off of me and wear it and we ll all evade together when a prisoner of style escapes its called an evasion its always called so when a king escapesf rinstance and the same with a kings son it dont make no difference whether hes a natural one or an unnatural one so tom he wrote the nonnamous letter and i smouched the yaller wenchs frock that night and put it on and shoved it under the front door the way tom told me to it said beware trouble is brewing keep a sharp lookout unknown friend next night we stuck a picture which tom drawed in blood of a skull and crossbones on the front door and next night another one of a coffin on the back door i never see a family in such a sweat they couldnt a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air if a door banged aunt sally she jumped and said ouch if anything fell she jumped and said ouch if you happened to touch her when she warnt noticing she done the same she couldnt face noway and be satisfied because she allowed there was something behind her every time so she was always a whirling around sudden and saying ouch and before shed got two thirds around shed whirl back again and say it again and she was afraid to go to bed but she dasnt set up so the thing was working very well tom said he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory he said it showed it was done right so he said now for the grand bulge so the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready and was wondering what we better do with it because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night tom he went down the lightning rod to spy around and the nigger at the back door was asleep and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back this letter said dont betray me i wish to be your friend there is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the indian territory going to steal your runaway nigger to night and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them i am one of the gang but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again and will betray the helish design they will sneak down from northards along the fence at midnight exact with a false key and go in the niggers cabin to get him i am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if i see any danger but stead of that i will baa like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all then whilst they are getting his chains loose you slip there and lock them in and can kill them at your leasure dont do anything but just the way i am telling you if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop jamboreehoo i do not wish any reward but to know i have done the right thing unknown friend chapter xl we was feeling pretty good after breakfast and took my canoe and went over the river a fishing with a lunch and had a good time and took a look at the raft and found her all right and got home late to supper and found them in such a sweat and worry they didnt know which end they was standing on and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper and wouldnt tell us what the trouble was and never let on a word about the new letter but didnt need to because we knowed as much about it as anybody did and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed and got up about half past eleven and tom put on aunt sallys dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch but says wheres the butter i laid out a hunk of it i says on a piece of a corn pone well you left it laid out then it aint here we can get along without it i says we can get along with it too he says just you slide down cellar and fetch it and then mosey right down the lightning rod and come along i ll go and stuff the straw into jims clothes to represent his mother in disguise and be ready to baa like a sheep and shove soon as you get there so out he went and down cellar went i the hunk of butter big as a persons fist was where i had left it so i took up the slab of corn pone with it on and blowed out my light and started up stairs very stealthy and got up to the main floor all right but here comes aunt sally with a candle and i clapped the truck in my hat and clapped my hat on my head and the next second she see me and she says you been down cellar yesm what you been doing down there nothn nothn nom well then what possessed you to go down there this time of night i dont knowm you dont know dont answer me that way tom i want to know what you been doing down there i haint been doing a single thing aunt sally i hope to gracious if i have i reckoned shed let me go now and as a generl thing she would but i s pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warnt yard stick straight so she says very decided you just march into that setting room and stay there till i come you been up to something you no business to and i lay i ll find out what it is before im done with you so she went away as i opened the door and walked into the setting room my but there was a crowd there fifteen farmers and every one of them had a gun i was most powerful sick and slunk to a chair and set down they was setting around some of them talking a little in a low voice and all of them fidgety and uneasy but trying to look like they warnt but i knowed they was because they was always taking off their hats and putting them on and scratching their heads and changing their seats and fumbling with their buttons i warnt easy myself but i didnt take my hat off all the same i did wish aunt sally would come and get done with me and lick me if she wanted to and let me get away and tell tom how wed overdone this thing and what a thundering hornets nest wed got ourselves into so we could stop fooling around straight off and clear out with jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us at last she come and begun to ask me questions but i couldnt answer them straight i didnt know which end of me was up because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay for them desperadoes and saying it warnt but a few minutes to midnight and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep signal and here was aunty pegging away at the questions and me a shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks i was that scared and the place getting hotter and hotter and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears and pretty soon when one of them says im for going and getting in the cabin first and right now and catching them when they come i most dropped and a streak of butter come a trickling down my forehead and aunt sally she see it and turns white as a sheet and says for the lands sake what is the matter with the child hes got the brain fever as shore as you re born and they re oozing out and everybody runs to see and she snatches off my hat and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter and she grabbed me and hugged me and says oh what a turn you did give me and how glad and grateful i am it aint no worse for lucks against us and it never rains but it pours and when i see that truck i thought wed lost you for i knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be if dear dear whyd nt you tell me that was what youd been down there for i wouldnt a cared now cler out to bed and dont lemme see no more of you till morning i was up stairs in a second and down the lightning rod in another one and shinning through the dark for the lean to i couldnt hardly get my words out i was so anxious but i told tom as quick as i could we must jump for it now and not a minute to lose the house full of men yonder with guns his eyes just blazed and he says no is that so aint it bully why huck if it was to do over again i bet i could fetch two hundred if we could put it off till hurry hurry i says wheres jim right at your elbow if you reach out your arm you can touch him hes dressed and everythings ready now we ll slide out and give the sheep signal but then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door and heard them begin to fumble with the pad lock and heard a man say i told you wed be too soon they havent come the door is locked here i ll lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for em in the dark and kill em when they come and the rest scatter around a piece and listen if you can hear em coming so in they come but couldnt see us in the dark and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed but we got under all right and out through the hole swift but soft jim first me next and tom last which was according to toms orders now we was in the lean to and heard trampings close by outside so we crept to the door and tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldnt make out nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further and when he nudged us jim must glide out first and him last so he set his ear to the crack and listened and listened and listened and the steps a scraping around out there all the time and at last he nudged us and we slid out and stooped down not breathing and not making the least noise and slipped stealthy towards the fence in injun file and got to it all right and me and jim over it but toms britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the steps coming so he had to pull loose which snapped the splinter and made a noise and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out whos that answer or i ll shoot but we didnt answer we just unfurled our heels and shoved then there was a rush and a bang bang bang and the bullets fairly whizzed around us we heard them sing out here they are they ve broke for the river after em boys and turn loose the dogs so here they come full tilt we could hear them because they wore boots and yelled but we didnt wear no boots and didnt yell we was in the path to the mill and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by and then dropped in behind them theyd had all the dogs shut up so they wouldnt scare off the robbers but by this time somebody had let them loose and here they come making powwow enough for a million but they was our dogs so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up and when they see it warnt nobody but us and no excitement to offer them they only just said howdy and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering and then we up steam again and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river but didnt make no more noise than we was obleeged to then we struck out easy and comfortable for the island where my raft was and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out and when we stepped on to the raft i says now old jim you re a free man again and i bet you wont ever be a slave no more en a mighty good job it wuz too huck it uz planned beautiful en it uz done beautiful en dey aint nobody kin git up a plan dats mo mixed up en splendid den what dat one wuz we was all glad as we could be but tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg when me and jim heard that we didnt feel so brash as what we did before it was hurting him considerable and bleeding so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the dukes shirts for to bandage him but he says gimme the rags i can do it myself dont stop now dont fool around here and the evasion booming along so handsome man the sweeps and set her loose boys we done it elegant deed we did i wish wed a had the handling of louis xvi there wouldnt a been no son of saint louis ascend to heaven wrote down in his biography no sir wed a whooped him over the border thats what wed a done with him and done it just as slick as nothing at all too man the sweeps man the sweeps but me and jim was consulting and thinking and after wed thought a minute i says say it jim so he says well den dis is de way it look to me huck ef it wuz him dat uz bein sot free en one er de boys wuz to git shot would he say go on en save me nemmine bout a doctor fr to save dis one is dat like mars tom sawyer would he say dat you bet he wouldnt well den is jim gywne to say it no sah i doan budge a step outn dis place dout a doctor not if its forty year i knowed he was white inside and i reckoned hed say what he did say so it was all right now and i told tom i was a going for a doctor he raised considerable row about it but me and jim stuck to it and wouldnt budge so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself but we wouldnt let him then he give us a piece of his mind but it didnt do no good so when he sees me getting the canoe ready he says well then if you re bound to go i ll tell you the way to do when you get to the village shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purse full of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark and then fetch him here in the canoe in a roundabout way amongst the islands and search him and take his chalk away from him and dont give it back to him till you get him back to the village or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again its the way they all do so i said i would and left and jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again chapter xli the doctor was an old man a very nice kind looking old man when i got him up i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting yesterday afternoon and camped on a piece of a raft we found and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams for it went off and shot him in the leg and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it nor let anybody know because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks who is your folks he says the phelpses down yonder oh he says and after a minute he says howd you say he got shot he had a dream i says and it shot him singular dream he says so he lit up his lantern and got his saddle bags and we started but when he sees the canoe he didnt like the look of her said she was big enough for one but didnt look pretty safe for two i says oh you neednt be afeard sir she carried the three of us easy enough what three why me and sid and and and the guns thats what i mean oh he says but he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her and shook his head and said he reckoned hed look around for a bigger one but they was all locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to wait till he come back or i could hunt around further or maybe i better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if i wanted to but i said i didnt so i told him just how to find the raft and then he started i struck an idea pretty soon i says to myself sposn he cant fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheeps tail as the saying is sposn it takes him three or four days what are we going to do lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag no sir i know what i ll do i ll wait and when he comes back if he says hes got to go any more i ll get down there too if i swim and we ll take and tie him and keep him and shove out down the river and when toms done with him we ll give him what its worth or all we got and then let him get ashore so then i crept into a lumber pile to get some sleep and next time i waked up the sun was away up over my head i shot out and went for the doctors house but they told me hed gone away in the night some time or other and warnt back yet well thinks i that looks powerful bad for tom and i ll dig out for the island right off so away i shoved and turned the corner and nearly rammed my head into uncle silass stomach he says why tom where you been all this time you rascal i haint been nowheres i says only just hunting for the runaway nigger me and sid why where ever did you go he says your aunts been mighty uneasy she neednt i says because we was all right we followed the men and the dogs but they outrun us and we lost them but we thought we heard them on the water so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over but couldnt find nothing of them so we cruised along up shore till we got kind of tired and beat out and tied up the canoe and went to sleep and never waked up till about an hour ago then we paddled over here to hear the news and sids at the post office to see what he can hear and im a branching out to get something to eat for us and then we re going home so then we went to the post office to get sid but just as i suspicioned he warnt there so the old man he got a letter out of the office and we waited awhile longer but sid didnt come so the old man said come along let sid foot it home or canoe it when he got done fooling around but we would ride i couldnt get him to let me stay and wait for sid and he said there warnt no use in it and i must come along and let aunt sally see we was all right when we got home aunt sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both and hugged me and give me one of them lickings of hern that dont amount to shucks and said shed serve sid the same when he come and the place was plum full of farmers and farmers wives

goodness sakes you can guess what kind of a fluster i was in by the time midnight come last night i hope to gracious if i warnt afraid theyd steal some o the family i was just to that pass i didnt have no reasoning faculties no more it looks foolish enough now in the daytime but i says to myself theres my two poor boys asleep way up stairs in that lonesome room and i declare to goodness i was that uneasyt i crep up there and locked em in i did and anybody would because you know when you get scared that way and it keeps running on and getting worse and worse all the time and your wits gets to addling and you get to doing all sorts o wild things and by and by you think to yourself sposn i was a boy and was away up there and the door aint locked and you she stopped looking kind of wondering and then she turned her head around slow and when her eye lit on me i got up and took a walk says i to myself i can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if i go out to one side and study over it a little so i done it but i dasnt go fur or shed a sent for me and when it was late in the day the people all went and then i come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and sid and the door was locked and we wanted to see the fun so we went down the lightning rod and both of us got hurt a little and we didnt never want to try that no more and then i went on and told her all what i told uncle silas before and then she said shed forgive us and maybe it was all right enough anyway and about what a body might expect of boys for all boys was a pretty harum scarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm hadnt come of it she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still stead of fretting over what was past and done so then she kissed me and patted me on the head and dropped into a kind of a brown study and pretty soon jumps up and says why lawsamercy its most night and sid not come yet what has become of that boy i see my chance so i skips up and says i ll run right up to town and get him i says no you wont she says you ll stay right wher you are ones enough to be lost at a time if he aint here to supper your uncle ll go well he warnt there to supper so right after supper uncle went he come back about ten a little bit uneasy hadnt run across toms track aunt sally was a good deal uneasy but uncle silas he said there warnt no occasion to be boys will be boys he said and you ll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right so she had to be satisfied but she said shed set up for him a while anyway and keep a light burning so he could see it and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle and tucked me in and mothered me so good i felt mean and like i couldnt look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time and said what a splendid boy sid was and didnt seem to want to ever stop talking about him and kept asking me every now and then if i reckoned he could a got lost or hurt or maybe drownded and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead and she not by him to help him and so the tears would drip down silent and i would tell her that sid was all right and would be home in the morning sure and she would squeeze my hand or maybe kiss me and tell me to say it again and keep on saying it because it done her good and she was in so much trouble and when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle and says the door aint going to be locked tom and theres the window and the rod but you ll be good wont you and you wont go for my sake laws knows i wanted to go bad enough to see about tom and was all intending to go but after that i wouldnt a went not for kingdoms but she was on my mind and tom was on my mind so i slept very restless and twice i went down the rod away in the night and slipped around front and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them and i wished i could do something for her but i couldnt only to swear that i wouldnt never do nothing to grieve her any more and the third time i waked up at dawn and slid down and she was there yet and her candle was most out and her old gray head was resting on her hand and she was asleep chapter xlii the old man was uptown again before breakfast but couldnt get no track of tom and both of them set at the table thinking and not saying nothing and looking mournful and their coffee getting cold and not eating anything and by and by the old man says did i give you the letter what letter the one i got yesterday out of the post office no you didnt give me no letter well i must a forgot it so he rummaged his pockets and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down and fetched it and give it to her she says why its from st petersburg its from sis i allowed another walk would do me good but i couldnt stir but before she could break it open she dropped it and run for she see something and so did i it was tom sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and jim in her calico dress with his hands tied behind him and a lot of people i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy and rushed she flung herself at tom crying and says oh hes dead hes dead i know hes dead and tom he turned his head a little and muttered something or other which showed he warnt in his right mind then she flung up her hands and says hes alive thank god and thats enough and she snatched a kiss of him and flew for the house to get the bed ready and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else as fast as her tongue could go every jump of the way i followed the men to see what they was going to do with jim and the old doctor and uncle silas followed after tom into the house the men was very huffy and some of them wanted to hang jim for an example to all the other niggers around there so they wouldnt be trying to run away like jim done and making such a raft of trouble and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights but the others said dont do it it wouldnt answer at all he aint our nigger and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him sure so that cooled them down a little because the people thats always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that haint done just right is always the very ones that aint the most anxious to pay for him when they ve got their satisfaction out of him they cussed jim considerble though and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while but jim never said nothing and he never let on to know me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own clothes on him and chained him again and not to no bed leg this time but to a big staple drove into the bottom log and chained his hands too and both legs and said he warnt to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come or he was sold at auction because he didnt come in a certain length of time and filled up our hole and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good bye cussing and then the old doctor comes and takes a look and says dont be no rougher on him than you re obleeged to because he aint a bad nigger when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldnt cut the bullet out without some help and he warnt in no condition for me to leave to go and get help and he got a little worse and a little worse and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldnt let me come a nigh him any more and said if i chalked his raft hed kill me and no end of wild foolishness like that and i see i couldnt do anything at all with him so i says i got to have help somehow and the minute i says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he ll help and he done it too and done it very well of course i judged he must be a runaway nigger and there i was and there i had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night it was a fix i tell you i had a couple of patients with the chills and of course id of liked to run up to town and see them but i dasnt because the nigger might get away and then id be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this morning and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller and yet he was risking his freedom to do it and was all tired out too and i see plain enough hed been worked main hard lately i liked the nigger for that i tell you gentlemen a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars and kind treatment too i had everything i needed and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home better maybe because it was so quiet but there i was with both ofm on my hands and there i had to stick till about dawn this morning then some men in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep so i motioned them in quiet and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about and we never had no trouble and the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep too we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on and towed her over very nice and quiet and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start he aint no bad nigger gentlemen thats what i think about him somebody says well it sounds very good doctor im obleeged to say then the others softened up a little too and i was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing jim that good turn and i was glad it was according to my judgment of him too because i thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him then they all agreed that jim had acted very well and was deserving to have some notice took of it and reward so every one of them promised right out and hearty that they wouldnt cuss him no more then they come out and locked him up i hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off because they was rotten heavy or could have meat and greens with his bread and water but they didnt think of it and i reckoned it warnt best for me to mix in but i judged id get the doctors yarn to aunt sally somehow or other as soon as id got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me explanations i mean of how i forgot to mention about sid being shot when i was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger but i had plenty time aunt sally she stuck to the sick room all day and all night and every time i see uncle silas mooning around i dodged him next morning i heard tom was a good deal better and they said aunt sally was gone to get a nap so i slips to the sick room and if i found him awake i reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash but he was sleeping and sleeping very peaceful too and pale not fire faced the way he was when he come so i set down and laid for him to wake in about half an hour aunt sally comes gliding in and there i was up a stump again she motioned me to be still and set down by me and begun to whisper and said we could all be joyful now because all the symptoms was first rate and hed been sleeping like that for ever so long and looking better and peacefuller all the time and ten to one hed wake up in his right mind so we set there watching and by and by he stirs a bit and opened his eyes very natural and takes a look and says hello why im at home hows that wheres the raft its all right i says and jim the same i says but couldnt say it pretty brash but he never noticed but says good splendid now we re all right and safe did you tell aunty i was going to say yes but she chipped in and says about what sid why about the way the whole thing was done what whole thing why the whole thing there aint but one how we set the runaway nigger free me and tom good land set the run what is the child talking about dear dear out of his head again no i aint out of my head i know all what im talking about we did set him free me and tom we laid out to do it and we done it and we done it elegant too hed got a start and she never checked him up just set and stared and stared and let him clip along and i see it warnt no use for me to put in why aunty it cost us a power of work weeks of it hours and hours every night whilst you was all asleep and we had to steal candles and the sheet and the shirt and your dress and spoons and tin plates and case knives and the warming pan and the grindstone and flour and just no end of things and you cant think what work it was to make the saws and pens and inscriptions and one thing or another and you cant think half the fun it was and we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things and nonnamous letters from the robbers and get up and down the lightning rod and dig the hole into the cabin and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket mercy sakes and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on for company for jim and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business because the men come before we was out of the cabin and we had to rush and they heard us and let drive at us and i got my share and we dodged out of the path and let them go by and when the dogs come they warnt interested in us but went for the most noise and we got our canoe and made for the raft and was all safe and jim was a free man and we done it all by ourselves and wasnt it bully aunty well i never heard the likes of it in all my born days so it was you you little rapscallions thats been making all this trouble and turned everybodys wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death i ve as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out o you this very minute to think here i ve been night after night a you just get well once you young scamp and i lay i ll tan the old harry out o both o ye but tom he was so proud and joyful he just couldnt hold in and his tongue just went it she a chipping in and spitting fire all along and both of them going it at once like a cat convention and she says well you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now for mind i tell you if i catch you meddling with him again meddling with who tom says dropping his smile and looking surprised with who why the runaway nigger of course whod you reckon tom looks at me very grave and says tom didnt you just tell me he was all right hasnt he got away him says aunt sally the runaway nigger deed he hasnt they ve got him back safe and sound and hes in that cabin again on bread and water and loaded down with chains till hes claimed or sold tom rose square up in bed with his eye hot and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills and sings out to me they haint no right to shut him up shove and dont you lose a minute turn him loose he aint no slave hes as free as any cretur that walks this earth what does the child mean i mean every word i say aunt sally and if somebody dont go i ll go i ve knowed him all his life and so has tom there old miss watson died two months ago and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river and said so and she set him free in her will then what on earth did you want to set him free for seeing he was already free well that is a question i must say and just like women why i wanted the adventure of it and id a waded neck deep in blood to goodness alive aunt polly if she warnt standing right there just inside the door looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie i wish i may never aunt sally jumped for her and most hugged the head off of her and cried over her and i found a good enough place for me under the bed for it was getting pretty sultry for us seemed to me and i peeped out and in a little while toms aunt polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at tom over her spectacles kind of grinding him into the earth you know and then she says yes you better turn yr head away i would if i was you tom oh deary me says aunt sally is he changed so why that aint tom its sid toms toms why where is tom he was here a minute ago you mean wheres huck finn thats what you mean i reckon i haint raised such a scamp as my tom all these years not to know him when i see him that would be a pretty howdy do come out from under that bed huck finn so i done it but not feeling brash aunt sally she was one of the mixed upest looking persons i ever see except one and that was uncle silas when he come in and they told it all to him it kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didnt know nothing at all the rest of the day and preached a prayer meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation because the oldest man in the world couldnt a understood it so toms aunt polly she told all about who i was and what and i had to up and tell how i was in such a tight place that when mrs phelps took me for tom sawyer she chipped in and says oh go on and call me aunt sally im used to it now and taint no need to change that when aunt sally took me for tom sawyer i had to stand it there warnt no other way and i knowed he wouldnt mind because it would be nuts for him being a mystery and hed make an adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied and so it turned out and he let on to be sid and made things as soft as he could for me and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting jim free in her will and so sure enough tom sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free and i couldnt ever understand before until that minute and that talk how he could help a body set a nigger free with his bringing up well aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and sid had come all right and safe she says to herself look at that now i might have expected it letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him so now i got to go and trapse all the way down the river eleven hundred mile and find out what that creeturs up to this time as long as i couldnt seem to get any answer out of you about it why i never heard nothing from you says aunt sally well i wonder why i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by sid being here well i never got em sis aunt polly she turns around slow and severe and says you tom well what he says kind of pettish dont you what me you impudent thing hand out them letters what letters them letters i be bound if i have to take a holt of you i ll they re in the trunk there now and they re just the same as they was when i got them out of the office i haint looked into them i haint touched them but i knowed theyd make trouble and i thought if you warnt in no hurry id well you do need skinning there aint no mistake about it and i wrote another one to tell you i was coming and i s pose he no it come yesterday i haint read it yet but its all right i ve got that one i wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadnt but i reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to so i never said nothing chapter the last the first time i catched tom private i asked him what was his idea time of the evasion what it was hed planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before and he said what he had planned in his head from the start if we got jim out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about his being free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass band and then he would be a hero and so would we but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was we had jim out of the chains in no time and when aunt polly and uncle silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom they made a heap of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give him all he wanted to eat and a good time and nothing to do and we had him up to the sick room and had a high talk and tom give jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient and doing it up so good and jim was pleased most to death and busted out and says dah now huck what i tell you what i tell you up dah on jackson islan i tole you i got a hairy breas en whats de sign un it en i tole you i ben rich wunst en gwineter to be rich agin en its come true en heah she is dah now doan talk to me signs is signs mine i tell you en i knowed jiss well at i uz gwineter be rich agin as is a stannin heah dis minute and then tom he talked along and talked along and says les all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit and go for howling adventures amongst the injuns over in the territory for a couple of weeks or two and i says all right that suits me but i aint got no money for to buy the outfit and i reckon i couldnt get none from home because its likely paps been back before now and got it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up no he haint tom says its all there yet six thousand dollars and more and your pap haint ever been back since hadnt when i come away anyhow jim says kind of solemn he aint a

guard for a watch and is always seeing what time it is and so there aint nothing more to write about and i am rotten glad of it because if id a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book i wouldnt a tackled it and aint a going to no more but i reckon i got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest because aunt sally shes going to adopt me and sivilize me and i cant stand it i been there before the end yours truly huck finn the adventures of tom sawyer chapter i tom no answer tom no answer whats gone with that boy i wonder you tom no answer the old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room then she put them up and looked out under them she seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy they were her state pair the pride of her heart and were built for style not service she could have seen through a pair of stove lids just as well she looked perplexed for a moment and then said not fiercely but still loud enough for the furniture to hear well i lay if i get hold of you i ll she did not finish for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with she resurrected nothing but the cat i never did see the beat of that boy she went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and jimpson weeds that constituted the garden no tom so she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted y o u u tom there was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight there i might a thought of that closet what you been doing in there nothing nothing look at your hands and look at your mouth what is that truck i dont know aunt well i know its jam thats what it is forty times i ve said if you didnt let that jam alone id skin you hand me that switch the switch hovered in the air the peril was desperate my look behind you aunt the old lady whirled round and snatched her skirts out of danger the lad fled on the instant scrambled up the high board fence and disappeared over it his aunt polly stood surprised a moment and then broke into a gentle laugh hang the boy cant i never learn anything aint he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time but old fools is the biggest fools there is cant learn an old dog new tricks as the saying is but my goodness he never plays them alike two days and how is a body to know whats coming he pears to know just how long he can torment me before i get my dander up and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh its all down again and i cant hit him a lick i aint doing my duty by that boy and thats the lords truth goodness knows spare the rod and spile the child as the good book says im a laying up sin and suffering for us both i know hes full of the old scratch but laws a me hes my own dead sisters boy poor thing and i aint got the heart to lash him somehow every time i let him off my conscience does hurt me so and every time i hit him my old heart most breaks well a well man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble as the scripture says and i reckon its so he ll play hookey this evening and southwestern for afternoon i ll just be obleeged to make him work tomorrow to punish him its mighty hard to make him work saturdays when all the boys is having holiday but he hates work more than he hates anything else and i ve got to do some of my duty by him or i ll be the ruination of the child tom did play hookey and he had a very good time he got back home barely in season to help jim the small colored boy saw next days wood and split the kindlings before supper at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to jim while jim did three fourths of the work toms younger brother or rather half brother sid was already through with his part of the work picking up chips for he was a quiet boy and had no adventurous trouble some ways while tom was eating his supper and stealing sugar as opportunity offered aunt polly asked him questions that were full of guile and very deep for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments like many other simple hearted souls it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning said she tom it was middling warm in school warnt it yesm powerful warm warnt it yesm didnt you want to go in a swimming tom a bit of a scare shot through tom a touch of uncomfortable suspicion he searched aunt pollys face but it told him nothing so he said nom well not very much the old lady reached out her hand and felt toms shirt and said but you aint too warm now though and it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind but in spite of her tom knew where the wind lay now so he forestalled what might be the next move some of us pumped on our heads mines damp yet see aunt polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence and missed a trick then she had a new inspiration tom you didnt have to undo your shirt collar where i sewed it to pump on your head did you unbutton your jacket the trouble vanished out of toms face he opened his jacket his shirt collar was securely sewed bother well go long with you id made sure youd played hookey and been a swimming but i forgive ye tom i reckon you re a kind of a singed cat as the saying is bettern you look this time she was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried and half glad that tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once but sidney said well now if i didnt think you sewed his collar with white thread but its black why i did sew it with white tom but tom did not wait for the rest as he went out at the door he said siddy i ll lick you for that in a safe place tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket and had thread bound about them one needle carried white thread and the other black he said shed never noticed if it hadnt been for sid confound it sometimes she sews it with white and sometimes she sews it with black i wish to gee miny shed stick to one or t other i cant keep the run of em but i bet you i ll lam sid for that i ll learn him he was not the model boy of the village he knew the model boy very well though and loathed him within two minutes or even less he had forgotten all his troubles not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a mans are to a man but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time just as mens misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises this new interest was a valued novelty in whistling which he had just acquired from a negro and he was suffering to practise it un disturbed it consisted in a peculiar bird like turn a sort of liquid warble produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music the reader probably remembers how to do it if he has ever been a boy diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude he felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet no doubt as far as strong deep unalloyed pleasure is concerned the advantage was with the boy not the astronomer the summer evenings were long it was not dark yet presently tom checked his whistle a stranger was before him a boy a shade larger than himself a new comer of any age or either sex was an im pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of st petersburg this boy was well dressed too well dressed on a week day this was simply as astounding his cap was a dainty thing his close buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty and so were his pantaloons he had shoes on and it was only friday he even wore a necktie a bright bit of ribbon he had a citified air about him that ate into toms vitals the more tom stared at the splendid marvel the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow neither boy spoke if one moved the other moved but only sidewise in a circle they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time finally tom said i can lick you id like to see you try it well i can do it no you cant either yes i can no you cant i can you cant can cant an uncomfortable pause then tom said whats your name tisnt any of your business maybe well i low i ll make it my business well why dont you if you say much i will much much much there now oh you think you re mighty smart dont you i could lick you with one hand tied behind me if i wanted to well why dont you do it you say you can do it well i will if you fool with me oh yes i ve seen whole families in the same fix smarty you think you re some now dont you oh what a hat you can lump that hat if you dont like it i dare you to knock it off and anybody that ll take a dare will suck eggs you re a liar you re another you re a fighting liar and dasnt take it up aw take a walk say if you give me much more of your sass i ll take and bounce a rock offn your head oh of course you will well i will well why dont you do it then what do you keep saying you will for why dont you do it its because you re afraid i aint afraid you are i aint you are another pause and more eying and sidling around each other presently they were shoulder to shoulder tom said get away from here go away yourself i wont i wont either so they stood each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace and both shoving with might and main and glowering at each other with hate but neither could get an advantage after struggling till both were hot and flushed each relaxed his strain with watchful caution and tom said you re a coward and a pup i ll tell my big brother on you and he can thrash you with his little finger and i ll make him do it too what do i care for your big brother i ve got a brother thats bigger than he is and whats more he can throw him over that fence too both brothers were imaginary thats a lie your saying so dont make it so tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe and said i dare you to step over that and i ll lick you till you cant stand up anybody that ll take a dare will steal sheep the new boy stepped over promptly and said now you said youd do it now lets see you do it dont you crowd me now you better look out well you said youd do it why dont you do it by jingo for two cents i will do it the new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision tom struck them to the ground in an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt gripped together like cats and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each others hair and clothes punched and scratched each others nose and covered themselves with dust and glory presently the confusion took form and through the fog of battle tom appeared seated astride the new boy and pounding him with his fists holler nuff said he the boy only struggled to free himself he was crying mainly from rage holler nuff and the pounding went on at last the stranger got out a smothered nuff and tom let him up and said now that ll learn you better look out who you re fooling with next time the new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes sobbing snuffling and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to tom the next time he caught him out to which tom responded with jeers and started off in high feather and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope tom chased the traitor home and thus found out where he lived he then held a position at the gate for some time daring the enemy to come outside but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined at last the enemys mother appeared and called tom a bad vicious vulgar child and ordered him away so he went away but he said he lowed to lay for that boy he got home pretty late that night and when he climbed cautiously in at the window he uncovered an ambuscade in the person of his aunt and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness chapter ii saturday morning was come and all the summer world was bright and fresh and brimming with life there was a song in every heart and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips there was cheer in every face and a spring in every step the locust trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air cardiff hill beyond the village and above it was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a delectable land dreamy reposeful and inviting tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long handled brush he surveyed the fence and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit thirty yards of board fence nine feet high life to him seemed hollow and existence but a burden sighing he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank repeated the operation did it again compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence and sat down on a tree box discouraged jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail and singing buffalo gals bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in toms eyes before but now it did not strike him so he remembered that there was company at the pump white mulatto and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns resting trading playthings quarrelling fighting skylarking and he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour and even then somebody generally had to go after him tom said say jim i ll fetch the water if you ll whitewash some jim shook his head and said cant mars tom ole missis she tole me i got to go an git dis water an not stop foolin roun wid anybody she say she spec mars tom gwine to ax me to whitewash an so she tole me go long an tend to my own business she lowed shed tend to de whitewashin oh never you mind what she said jim thats the way she always talks gimme the bucket i wont be gone only a a minute she wont ever know oh i dasnt mars tom ole missis shed take an tar de head offn me deed she would she she never licks anybody whacks em over the head with her thimble and who cares for that id like to know she talks awful but talk dont hurt anyways it dont if she dont cry jim i ll give you a marvel i ll give you a white alley jim began to waver white alley jim and its a bully taw my dats a mighty gay marvel i tell you but mars tom is powerful fraid ole missis and besides if you will i ll show you my sore toe jim was only human this attraction was too much for him he put down his pail took the white alley and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound in another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear tom was whitewashing with vigor and aunt polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye but toms energy did not last he began to think of the fun he had planned for this day and his sorrows multiplied soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work the very thought of it burnt him like fire he got out his worldly wealth and examined it bits of toys marbles and trash enough to buy an exchange of work maybe but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom so he returned his straitened means to his pocket and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys at this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him nothing less than a great magnificent inspiration he took up his brush and went tranquilly to work ben rogers hove in sight presently the very boy of all boys whose ridicule he had been dreading bens gait was the hop skip and jump proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high he was eating an apple and giving a long melodious whoop at intervals followed by a deep toned ding dong dong ding dong dong for he was personating a steamboat as he drew near he slackened speed took the middle of the street leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance for he was personating the big missouri and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water he was boat and captain and engine bells combined so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane deck giving the orders and executing them stop her sir ting a ling ling the headway ran almost out and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk ship up to back ting a ling ling his arms straightened and stiffened down his sides set her back on the stabboard ting a ling ling chow ch chow wow chow his right hand mean time describing stately circles for it was representing a forty foot wheel let her go back on the labboard ting a ling ling chow ch chow chow the left hand began to describe circles stop the stabboard ting a ling ling stop the labboard come ahead on the stabboard stop her let your outside turn over slow ting a ling ling chow ow ow get out that head line lively now come out with your spring line what re you about there take a turn round that stump with the bight of it stand by that stage now let her go done with the engines sir ting a ling ling sht sh t sht trying the gauge cocks tom went on whitewashing paid no attention to the steamboat ben stared a moment and then said hi yi you re up a stump aint you no answer tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result as before ben ranged up alongside of him toms mouth watered for the apple but he stuck to his work ben said hello old chap you got to work hey tom wheeled suddenly and said why its you ben i warnt noticing say im going in a swimming i am dont you wish you could but of course youd druther work wouldnt you course you would tom contemplated the boy a bit and said what do you call work why aint that work tom resumed his whitewashing and answered carelessly well maybe it is and maybe it aint all i know is it suits tom sawyer oh come now you dont mean to let on that you like it the brush continued to move like it well i dont see why i oughtnt to like it does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day that put the thing in a new light ben stopped nibbling his apple tom swept his brush daintily back and forth stepped back to note the effect added a touch here and there criticised the effect again ben watching every move and getting more and more interested more and more absorbed presently he said say tom let me whitewash a little tom considered was about to consent but he altered his mind no no i reckon it wouldnt hardly do ben you see aunt pollys awful particular about this fence right here on the street you know but if it was the back fence i wouldnt mind and she wouldnt yes shes awful particular about this fence its got to be done very careful i reckon there aint one boy in a thousand maybe two thousand that can do it the way its got to be done no is that so oh come now lemme just try only just a little id let you if you was me tom ben id like to honest injun but aunt polly well jim wanted to do it but she wouldnt let him sid wanted to do it and she wouldnt let sid now dont you see how im fixed if you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it oh shucks i ll be just as careful now lemme try say i ll give you the core of my apple well here no ben now dont im afeard i ll give you all of it tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but alacrity in his heart and while the late steamer big missouri worked and sweated in the sun the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by dangled his legs munched his apple and planned the slaughter of more innocents there was no lack of material boys happened along every little while they came to jeer but remained to whitewash by the time ben was fagged out tom had traded the next chance to billy fisher for a kite in good repair and when he played out johnny miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with and so on and so on hour after hour and when the middle of the afternoon came from being a poor poverty stricken boy in the morning tom was literally rolling in wealth he had besides the things before mentioned twelve marbles part of a jews harp a piece of blue bottle glass to look through a spool cannon a key that wouldnt unlock anything a fragment of chalk a glass stopper of a decanter a tin soldier a couple of tadpoles six fire crackers a kitten with only one eye a brass door knob a dog collar but no dog the handle of a knife four pieces of orange peel and a dilapidated old window sash he had had a nice good idle time all the while plenty of company and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it if he hadnt run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all he had discovered a great law of human action without knowing it namely that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain if he had been a great and wise philosopher like the writer of this book he would now have comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do and this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread mill is work while rolling ten pins or climbing mont blanc is only amusement there are wealthy gentlemen in england who drive four horse passenger coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them considerable money but if they were offered wages for the service that would turn it into work and then they would resign the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances and then wended toward headquarters to report chapter iii tom presented himself before aunt polly who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment which was bedroom breakfast room dining room and library combined the balmy summer air the restful quiet the odor of the flowers and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect and she was nodding over her knitting for she had no company but the cat and it was asleep in her lap her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety she had thought that of course tom had deserted long ago and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way he said maynt i go and play now aunt what a ready how much have you done its all done aunt tom dont lie to me i cant bear it i aint aunt it is all done aunt polly placed small trust in such evidence she went out to see for herself and she would have been content to find twenty per cent of toms statement true when she found the entire fence white washed and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated and even a streak added to the ground her astonishment was almost unspeakable she said well i never theres no getting round it you can work when you re a mind to tom and then she diluted the compliment by adding but its powerful seldom you re a mind to im bound to say well go long and play but mind you get back some time in a week or i ll tan you she was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort and while she closed with a happy scriptural flourish he hooked a doughnut then he skipped out and saw sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling they raged around sid like a hail storm and before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue six or seven clods had taken personal effect and tom was over the fence and gone there was a gate but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it his soul was at peace now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble tom skirted the block and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunts cow stable he presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment and hastened toward the public square of the village where two military companies of boys had met for conflict according to previous appointment tom was general of one of these armies joe harper a bosom friend general of the other these two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person that being better suited to the still smaller fry but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides de camp toms army won a great victory after a long and hard fought battle then the dead were counted prisoners exchanged the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon and the day for the necessary battle appointed after which the armies fell into line and marched away and tom turned homeward alone as he was passing by the house where jeff thatcher lived he saw a new girl in the garden a lovely little blue eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long tails white summer frock and embroidered pan talettes the fresh crowned hero fell without firing a shot a certain amy lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind he had thought he loved her to distraction he had regarded his passion as adoration and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality he had been months winning her she had confessed hardly a week ago he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done he worshipped this new angel with furtive eye till he saw that she had discovered him then he pretended he did not know she was present and began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish ways in order to win her admiration he kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time but by and by while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house tom came up to the fence and leaned on it grieving and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer she halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold but his face lit up right away for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared the boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose with his head tilted far back and as he moved from side to side in his efforts he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy finally his bare foot rested upon it his pliant toes closed upon it and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner but only for a minute only while he could button the flower inside his jacket next his heart or next his stomach possibly for he was not much posted in anatomy and not hypercritical anyway he returned now and hung about the fence till nightfall showing off as before but the girl never exhibited herself again though tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window meantime and been aware of his attentions finally he strode home reluctantly with his poor head full of visions all through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered what had got into the child he took a good scolding about clodding sid and did not seem to mind it in the least he tried to steal sugar under his aunts very nose and got his knuckles rapped for it he said aunt you dont whack sid when he takes it well sid dont torment a body the way you do youd be always into that sugar if i warnt watching you presently she stepped into the kitchen and sid happy in his immunity reached for the sugar bowl a sort of glorying over tom which was wellnigh unbearable but sids fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke tom was in ecstasies in such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent he said to himself that he would not speak a word even when his aunt came in but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief and then he would tell and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model catch it he was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles he said to himself now its coming and the next instant he was sprawling on the floor the potent palm was uplifted to strike again when tom cried out hold on now what er you belting me for sid broke it aunt polly paused perplexed and tom looked for healing pity but when she got her tongue again she only said umf well you didnt get a lick amiss i reckon you been into some other audacious mischief when i wasnt around like enough then her conscience reproached her and she yearned to say something kind and loving but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong and discipline forbade that so she kept silence and went about her affairs with a troubled heart tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes he knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it he would hang out no signals he would take notice of none he knew that a yearning glance fell upon him now and then through a film of tears but he refused recognition of it he pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word but he would turn his face to the wall and die with that word unsaid ah how would she feel then and he pictured himself brought home from the river dead with his curls all wet and his sore heart at rest how she would throw herself upon him and how her tears would fall like rain and her lips pray god to give her back her boy and she would never never abuse him any more but he would lie there cold and white and make no sign a poor little sufferer whose griefs were at an end he so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams that he had to keep swallowing he was so like to choke and his eyes swam in a blur of water which overflowed when he winked and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose and such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it it was too sacred for such contact and so presently when his cousin mary danced in all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age long visit of one week to the country he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other he wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit a log raft in the river invited him and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream wishing the while that he could only be drowned all at once and unconsciously without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature then he thought of his flower he got it out rumpled and wilted and it mightily increased his dismal felicity he wondered if she would pity him if she knew would she cry and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world this picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights till he wore it threadbare at last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness about half past nine or ten o clock he came along the deserted street to where the adored unknown lived he paused a moment no sound fell upon his listening ear a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second story window was the sacred presence there he climbed the fence threaded his stealthy way through the plants till he stood under that window he looked up at it long and with emotion then he laid him down on the ground under it disposing himself upon his back with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower and thus he would die out in the cold world with no shelter over his homeless head no friendly hand to wipe the death damps from his brow no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came and thus she would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning and oh would she drop one little tear upon his poor lifeless form would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted so untimely cut down the window went up a maid servants discordant voice profaned the holy calm and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyrs remains the strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort there was a whiz as of a missile in the air mingled with the murmur of a curse a sound as of shivering glass followed and a small vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom not long after as tom all undressed for bed was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip sid woke up but if he had any dim idea of making any references to allusions he thought better of it and held his peace for there was danger in toms eye tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers and sid made mental note of the omission chapter iv the sun rose upon a tranquil world and beamed down upon the peaceful village like a benediction breakfast over aunt polly had family worship it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of scriptural quotations welded together with a thin mortar of originality and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the mosaic law as from sinai then tom girded up his loins so to speak and went to work to get his verses sid had learned his lesson days before tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses and he chose part of the sermon on the mount because he could find no verses that were shorter at the end of half an hour tom had a vague general idea of his lesson but no more for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought and his hands were busy with distracting recreations mary took his book to hear him recite and he tried to find his way through the fog blessed are the a a poor yes poor blessed are the poor a a in spirit in spirit blessed are the poor in spirit for they they theirs for theirs blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they they sh for they a s h a for they sh oh i dont know what it is shall oh shall for they shall for they shall a a shall mourn a a blessed are they that shall they that a they that shall mourn for they shall a shall what why dont you tell me mary what do you want to be so mean for oh tom you poor thick headed thing im not teasing you i wouldnt do that you must go and learn it again dont you be discouraged tom you ll manage it and if you do i ll give you something ever so nice there now thats a good boy all right what is it mary tell me what it is never you mind tom you know if i say its nice it is nice you bet you thats so mary all right i ll tackle it again and he did tackle it again and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success mary gave him a brand new barlow knife worth twelve and a half cents and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations true the knife would not cut anything but it was a sure enough barlow and there was inconceivable grandeur in that though where the western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so perhaps tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it and was arranging to begin on the bureau when he was called off to dress for sunday school mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down turned up his sleeves poured out the water on the ground gently and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door but mary removed the towel and said now aint you ashamed tom you mustnt be so bad water wont hurt you tom was a trifle disconcerted the basin was refilled and this time he stood over it a little while gathering resolution took in a big breath and began when he entered the kitchen presently with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face but when he emerged from the towel he was not yet satisfactory for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws like a mask below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck mary took him in hand and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother without distinction of color and his saturated hair was neatly brushed and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect he privately smoothed out the curls with labor and difficulty and plastered his hair close down to his head for he held curls to be effeminate and his own filled his life with bitterness then mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on sundays during two years they were simply called his other clothes and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe the girl put him to rights after he had dressed himself she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat he now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable he was fully as uncomfortable as he looked for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him he hoped that mary would forget his shoes but the hope was blighted she coated them thoroughly with tallow as was the custom and brought them out he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didnt want to do but mary said persuasively please tom thats a good boy so he got into the shoes snarling mary was soon ready and the three children set out for sunday school a place that tom hated with his whole heart but sid and mary were fond of it sabbath school hours were from nine to half past ten and then church service two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily and the other always remained too for stronger reasons the churchs high backed uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons the edifice was but a small plain affair with a sort of pine board tree box on top of it for a steeple at the door tom dropped back a step and accosted a sunday dressed comrade say billy got a yaller ticket yes what ll you take for her what ll you give piece of lickrish and a fish hook less see em tom exhibited they were satisfactory and the property changed hands then tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones he waylaid other boys as they came and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer he entered the church now with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy the teacher a grave elderly man interfered then turned his back a moment and tom pulled a boys hair in the next bench and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around stuck a pin in another boy presently in order to hear him say ouch and got a new reprimand from his teacher toms whole class were of a pattern restless noisy and troublesome when they came to recite their lessons not one of them knew his verses perfectly but had to be prompted all along however they worried through and each got his reward in small blue tickets each with a passage of scripture on it each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation ten blue tickets equalled a red one and could be exchanged for it ten red tickets equalled a yellow one for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound bible worth forty cents in those easy times to the pupil how many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses even for a dore bible and yet mary had acquired two bibles in this way it was the patient work of two years and a boy of german parentage had won four or five he once recited three thousand verses without stopping but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth a grievous misfortune for the school for on great occasions before company the superintendent as tom expressed it had always made this boy come out and spread himself only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a bible and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholars heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks it is possible that toms mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it in due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit with a closed hymn book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves and commanded attention when a sunday school superintendent makes his customary little speech a hymn book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert though why is a mystery for neither the hymn book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer this superintendent was a slim creature of thirty five with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair he wore a stiff standing collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank note and had fringed ends his boot toes were turned sharply up in the fashion of the day like sleigh runners an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together mr walters was very earnest of mien and very sincere and honest at heart and he held sacred things and places in such reverence and so separated them from worldly matters that unconsciously to himself his sunday school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week days he began after this fashion now children i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two there that is it that is the way good little boys and girls should do i see one little girl who is looking out of the window i am afraid she thinks i am out there somewhere perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds applausive titter i want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright clean little faces assembled in a place like this learning to do right and be good and so forth and so on it is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration it was of a pattern which does not vary and so it is familiar to us all the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary but now every sound ceased suddenly with the subsidence of mr walters voice and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare the entrance of visitors lawyer thatcher accompanied by a very feeble and aged man a fine portly middle aged gentleman with iron gray hair and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latters wife the lady was leading a child tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings conscience smitten too he could not meet amy lawrences eye he could not brook her loving gaze but when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment the next moment he was showing off with all his might cuffing boys pulling hair making faces in a word using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause his exaltation had but one alloy the memory of his humiliation in this angels garden and that record in sand was fast washing out under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now the visitors were given the highest seat of honor and as soon as mr walters speech was finished he introduced them to the school the middle aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage no less a one than the county judge altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon and they wondered what kind of material he was made of and they half wanted to hear him roar and were half afraid he might too he was from constantinople twelve miles away so he had travelled and seen the world these very eyes had looked upon the county court house which was said to have a tin roof the awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes this was the great judge thatcher brother of their own lawyer jeff thatcher immediately went forward to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school it would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings look at him jim hes a going up there say look hes a going to shake hands with him he is shaking hands with him by jings dont you wish you was jeff mr walters fell to showing off with all sorts of official bustlings and activities giving orders delivering judgments discharging directions here there everywhere that he could find a target the librarian showed off running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in the young lady teachers showed off bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly the young gentlemen teachers showed off with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline and most of the teachers of both sexes found business up at the library by the pulpit and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times with much seeming vexation the little girls showed off in various ways and the little boys showed off with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings and above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur for he was showing off too there was only one thing wanting to make mr walters ecstasy complete and that was a chance to deliver a bible prize and exhibit a prodigy several pupils had a few yellow tickets but none had enough he had been around among the star pupils inquiring he would have given worlds now to have that german lad back again with a sound mind and now at this moment when hope was dead tom sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets nine red tickets and ten blue ones and demanded a bible this was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years but there was no getting around it here were the certified checks and they were good for their face tom was therefore elevated to a place with the judge and the other elect and the great news was announced from headquarters it was the most stunning surprise of the decade and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial ones altitude and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one the boys were all eaten up with envy but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges these despised themselves as being the dupes of a wily fraud a guileful snake in the grass the prize was delivered to tom with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances but it lacked somewhat of the true gush for the poor fellows instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light perhaps it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of scriptural wisdom on his premises a dozen would strain his capacity without a doubt amy lawrence was proud and glad and she tried to make tom see it in her face but he wouldnt look she wondered then she was just a grain troubled next a dim suspicion came and went came again she watched a furtive glance told her worlds and then her heart broke and she was jealous and angry and the tears came and she hated everybody tom most of all she thought tom was introduced to the judge but his tongue was tied his breath would hardly come his heart quaked partly because of the awful greatness of the man but mainly because he was her parent he would have liked to fall down and worship him if it were in the dark the judge put his hand on toms head and called him a fine little man and asked him what his name was the boy stammered gasped and got it out tom oh no not tom it is thomas ah thats it i thought there was more to it maybe thats very well but you ve another one i daresay and you ll tell it to me wont you tell the gentleman your other name thomas said walters and say sir you mustnt forget your manners thomas sawyer sir thats it thats a good boy fine boy fine manly little fellow two thousand verses is a great many very very great many and you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world its what makes great men and good men you ll be a great man and a good man yourself some day thomas and then you ll look back and say its all owing to the precious sunday school privileges of my boyhood its all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn its all owing to the good superintendent who encouraged me and watched over me and gave me a beautiful bible a splendid elegant bible to keep and have it all for my own always its all owing to right bringing up that is what you will say thomas and you wouldnt take any money for those two thousand verses no indeed you wouldnt and now you wouldnt mind telling me and this lady some of the things you ve learned no i know you wouldnt for we are proud of little boys that learn now no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples wont you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed tom was tugging at a button hole and looking sheepish he blushed now and his eyes fell mr walters heart sank within him he said to himself it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question why did the judge ask him yet he felt obliged to speak up and say answer the gentleman thomas dont be afraid tom still hung fire now i know you ll tell me said the lady the names of the first two disciples were david and goliah let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene chapter v about half past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon the sunday school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied pews with their parents so as to be under supervision aunt polly came and tom and sid and mary sat with her tom being placed next the aisle in order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible the crowd filed up the aisles the aged and needy postmaster who had seen better days the mayor and his wife for they had a mayor there among other unnecessaries the justice of the peace the widow douglass fair smart and forty a generous good hearted soul and well to do her hill mansion the only palace in the town and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that st petersburg could boast the bent and venerable major and mrs ward lawyer riverson the new notable from a distance next the belle of the village followed by a troop of lawn clad and ribbon decked young heart breakers then all the young clerks in town in a body for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane heads a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers till the last girl had run their gantlet and last of all came the model boy willie mufferson taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass he always brought his mother to church and was the pride of all the matrons the boys all hated him he was so good and besides he had been thrown up to them so much his white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind as usual on sundays accidentally tom had no handkerchief and he looked upon boys who had as snobs the congregation being fully assembled now the bell rang once more to warn laggards and stragglers and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery the choir always tittered and whispered all through service there was once a church choir that was not ill bred but i have forgotten where it was now it was a great many years ago and i can scarcely remember anything about it but i think it was in some foreign country the minister gave out the hymn and read it through with a relish in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country his voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a spring board shall i be car ri ed toe the skies on flow ry beds of ease whilst others fight to win the prize and sail thro bloody seas he was regarded as a wonderful reader at church sociables he was always called upon to read poetry and when he was through the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps and wall their eyes and shake their heads as much as to say words cannot express it it is too beautiful too beautiful for this mortal earth after the hymn had been sung the rev mr sprague turned himself into a bulletin board and read off notices of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom a queer custom which is still kept up in america even in cities away here in this age of abundant newspapers often the less there is to justify a traditional custom the harder it is to get rid of it and now the minister prayed a good generous prayer it was and went into details it pleaded for the church and the little children of the church for the other churches of the village for the village itself for the county for the state for the state officers for the united states for the churches of the united states for congress for the president for the officers of the government for poor sailors tossed by stormy seas for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of european monarchies and oriental despotisms for such as have the light and the good tidings and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal for the heathen in the far islands of the sea and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor and be as seed sown in fertile ground yielding in time a grateful harvest of good amen there was a rustling of dresses and the standing congregation sat down the boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer he only endured it if he even did that much he was restive all through it he kept tally of the details of the prayer unconsciously for he was not listening but he knew the ground of old and the clergymans regular route over it and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it he considered additions unfair and scoundrelly in the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together embracing its head with its arms and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat tails going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe as indeed it was for as sorely as toms hands itched to grab for it they did not dare he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on but with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward and the instant the amen was out the fly was a prisoner of war his aunt detected the act and made him let it go the minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving tom counted the pages of the sermon after church he always knew how many pages there had been but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse however this time he was really interested for a little while the minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the worlds hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them but the pathos the lesson the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the on looking nations his face lit with the thought and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child if it was a tame lion now he lapsed into suffering again as the dry argument was resumed presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out it was a large black beetle with formidable jaws a pinchbug he called it it was in a percussion cap box the first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger a natural fillip followed the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back and the hurt finger went into the boys mouth the beetle lay there working its helpless legs unable to turn over tom eyed it and longed for it but it was safe out of his reach other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle and they eyed it too presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along sad at heart lazy with the summer softness and the quiet weary of captivity sighing for change he spied the beetle the drooping tail lifted and wagged he surveyed the prize walked around it smelt at it from a safe distance walked around it again grew bolder and took a closer smell then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it just missing it made another and another began to enjoy the diversion subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws and continued his experiments grew weary at last and then indifferent and absent minded his head nodded and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy who seized it there was a sharp yelp a flirt of the poodles head and the beetle fell a couple of yards away and lit on its back once more the neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy several faces went behind fans and hand kerchiefs and tom was entirely happy the dog looked foolish and probably felt so but there was resentment in his heart too and a craving for revenge so he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again jumping at it from every point of a circle lighting with his fore paws within an inch of the creature making even closer snatches at it with his teeth and jerking his head till his ears flapped again but he grew tired once more after a while tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief followed an ant around with his nose close to the floor and quickly wearied of that yawned sighed forgot the beetle entirely and sat down on it then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle the yelps continued and so did the dog he crossed the house in front of the altar he flew down the other aisle he crossed before the doors he clamored up the home stretch his anguish grew with his progress till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light at last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course and sprang into its masters lap he flung it out of the window and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance by this time the whole church was red faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter and the sermon had come to a dead standstill the discourse was resumed presently but it went lame and halting all possibility of impressiveness being at an end for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth under cover of some remote pew back as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing it was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced tom sawyer went home quite cheerful thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it he had but one marring thought he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off chapter vi monday morning found tom sawyer miserable monday morning always found him so because it began another weeks slow suffering in school he generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious tom lay thinking presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick then he could stay home from school here was a vague possibility he canvassed his system no ailment was found and he investigated again this time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms and he began to encourage them with considerable hope but they soon grew feeble and presently died wholly away he reflected further suddenly he discovered something one of his upper front teeth was loose this was lucky he was about to begin to groan as a starter as he called it when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument his aunt would pull it out and that would hurt so he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present and seek further nothing offered for some little time and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger so the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection but now he did not know the necessary symptoms however it seemed well worth while to chance it so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit but sid slept on unconscious tom groaned louder and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe no result from sid tom was panting with his exertions by this time he took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans sid snored on tom was aggravated he said sid sid and shook him this course worked well and tom began to groan again sid yawned stretched then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort and began to stare at tom tom went on groaning sid said tom say tom no response here tom tom what is the matter tom and he shook him and looked in his face anxiously tom moaned out oh dont sid dont joggle me why whats the matter tom i must call auntie no never mind it ll be over by and by maybe dont call anybody but i must dont groan so tom its awful how long you been this way hours ouch oh dont stir so sid you ll kill me tom why didnt you wake me sooner oh tom dont it makes my flesh crawl to hear you tom what is the matter i forgive you everything sid groan everything you ve ever done to me when im gone oh tom you aint dying are you dont tom oh dont maybe i forgive everybody sid groan tell em so sid and sid you give my window sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl thats come to town and tell her but sid had snatched his clothes and gone tom was suffering in reality now so handsomely was his imagination working and so his groans had gathered quite a genuine tone sid flew downstairs and said oh aunt polly come toms dying dying yesm dont wait come quick rubbage i dont believe it but she fled upstairs nevertheless with sid and mary at her heels and her face grew white too and her lip trembled when she reached the bedside she gasped out you tom tom whats the matter with you oh auntie im whats the matter with you what is the matter with you child oh auntie my sore toes mortified the old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little then cried a little then did both together this restored her and she said tom what a turn you did give me now you shut up that nonsense and climb out of this the groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe the boy felt a little foolish and he said aunt polly it seemed mortified and it hurt so i never minded my tooth at all your tooth indeed whats the matter with your tooth one of thems loose and it aches perfectly awful there there now dont begin that groaning again open your mouth well your tooth is loose but you re not going to die about that mary get me a silk thread and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen tom said oh please auntie dont pull it out it dont hurt any more i wish i may never stir if it does please dont auntie i dont want to stay home from school oh you dont dont you so all this row was because you thought youd get to stay home from school and go a fishing tom tom i love you so and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness by this time the dental instruments were ready the old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to toms tooth with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boys face the tooth hung dangling by the bedpost now but all trials bring their compensations as tom wended to school after breakfast he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way he gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time now found himself suddenly without an adherent and shorn of his glory his heart was heavy and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasnt anything to spit like tom sawyer but another boy said sour grapes and he wandered away a dismantled hero shortly tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village huckleberry finn son of the town drunkard huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad and because all their children admired him so and delighted in his forbidden society and wished they dared to be like him tom was like the rest of the respectable boys in that he envied huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition and was under strict orders not to play with him so he played with him every time he got a chance huckleberry was always dressed in the cast off clothes of full grown men and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags his hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim his coat when he wore one hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back but one suspender supported his trousers the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up huckleberry came and went at his own free will he slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet he did not have to go to school or to church or call any being master or obey anybody he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose and stay as long as it suited him nobody forbade him to fight he could sit up as late as he pleased he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall he never had to wash nor put on clean clothes he could swear wonderfully in a word everything that goes to make life precious that boy had so thought every harassed hampered respectable boy in st petersburg tom hailed the romantic outcast hello huckleberry hello yourself and see how you like it whats that you got dead cat lemme see him huck my hes pretty stiff whered you get him bought

and the nigger told me there now well what of it they ll all lie leastways all but the nigger i dont know him but i never see a nigger that wouldnt lie shucks now you tell me how bob tanner done it huck why he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain water was in the daytime certainly with his face to the stump yes least i reckon so did he say anything i dont reckon he did i dont know aha talk about trying to cure warts with spunk water such a blame fool way as that why that aint a going to do any good you got to go all by yourself to the middle of the woods where you know theres a spunk water stump and just as its midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say barley corn barley corn injun meal shorts spunk water spunk water swaller these warts and then walk away quick eleven steps with your eyes shut and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody because if you speak the charms busted well that sounds like a good way but that aint the way bob tanner done no sir you can bet he didnt becuz hes the wartiest boy in this town and he wouldnt have a wart on him if hed knowed how to work spunk water i ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way huck i play with frogs so much that i ve always got considerable many warts sometimes i take em off with a bean yes beans good i ve done that have you whats your way you take and split the bean and cut the wart so as to get some blood and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon and then you burn up the rest of the bean you see that piece thats got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing trying to fetch the other piece to it and so that helps the blood to draw the wart and pretty soon off she comes yes thats it huck thats it though when you re burying it if you say down bean off wart come no more to bother me its better thats the way joe harper does and hes been nearly to coonville and most everywheres but say how do you cure em with dead cats why you take your cat and go and get in the grave yard long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried and when its midnight a devil will come or maybe two or three but you cant see em you can only hear something like the wind or maybe hear em talk and when they re taking that feller away you heave your cat after em and say devil follow corpse cat follow devil warts follow cat im done with ye that ll fetch any wart sounds rightd you ever try it huck no but old mother hopkins told me well i reckon its so then becuz they say shes a witch say why tom i know she is she witched pap pap says so his own self he come along one day and he see she was a witching him so he took up a rock and if she hadnt dodged hed a got her well that very night he rolled offn a shed wher he was a layin drunk and broke his arm why thats awful how did he know she was a witching him lord pap can tell easy pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy they re a witching you specially if they mumble becuz when they mumble they re saying the lords prayer backards say hucky when you going to try the cat to night i reckon they ll come after old hoss williams to night but they buried him saturday didnt they get him saturday night why how you talk how could their charms

plenty i could have a thousand of em if i wanted to well why dont you becuz you know mighty well you cant this is a pretty early tick i reckon its the first one i ve seen this year say huck i ll give you my tooth for him less see it tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it huckleberry viewed it wistfully the temptation was very strong at last he said is it genuwyne tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy well all right said huckleberry its a trade tom enclosed the tick in the percussion cap box that had lately been the pinchbugs prison and the boys separated each feeling wealthier than before when tom reached the little isolated frame school house he strode in briskly with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed he hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business like alacrity the master throned on high in his great splint bottom arm chair was dozing lulled by the drowsy hum of study the interruption roused him thomas sawyer tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full it meant trouble sir come up here now sir why are you late again as usual tom was about to take refuge in a lie when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love and by that form was the only vacant place on the girls side of the school house he instantly said i stopped to talk with huckleberry finn the masters pulse stood still and he stared helplessly the buzz of study ceased the pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind the master said you you did what stopped to talk with huckleberry finn there was no mistaking the words thomas sawyer this is the most astounding confession i have ever listened to no mere ferule will answer for this offence take off your jacket the masters arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished then the order followed now sir go and sit with the girls and let this be a warning to you the titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune he sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room but tom sat still with his arms upon the long low desk before him and seemed to study his book by and by attention ceased from him and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl she observed it made a mouth at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute when she cautiously faced around again a peach lay before her she thrust it away tom gently put it back she thrust it away again but with less animosity tom patiently returned it to its place then she let it remain tom scrawled on his slate please take it i got more the girl glanced at the words but made no sign now the boy began to draw something on the slate hiding his work with his left hand for a time the girl refused to notice but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs the boy worked on apparently unconscious the girl made a sort of non committal attempt to see but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it at last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered let me see it tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney then the girls interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else when it was finished she gazed a moment then whispered its nice make a man the artist erected a man in the front yard that resembled a derrick he could have stepped over the house but the girl was not hypercritical she was satisfied with the monster and whispered its a beautiful man now make me coming along tom drew an hour glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan the girl said its ever so nice i wish i could draw its easy whispered tom i ll learn you oh will you when at noon do you go home to dinner i ll stay if you will good thats a whack whats your name becky thatcher whats yours oh i know its thomas sawyer thats the name they lick me by im tom when im good you call me tom will you yes now tom began to scrawl something on the slate hiding the words from the girl but she was not backward this time she begged to see tom said oh it aint anything yes it is no it aint you dont want to see yes i do indeed i do please let me you ll tell no i wont deed and deed and double deed wont you wont tell anybody at all ever as long as you live no i wont ever tell any body now let me oh you dont want to see now that you treat me so i will see and she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed i love you oh you bad thing and she hit his hand a smart rap but reddened and looked pleased nevertheless just at this juncture the boy felt a slow fateful grip closing on his ear and a steady lifting impulse in that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school then the master stood over him during a few awful moments and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word but although toms ear tingled his heart was jubilant as the school quieted down tom made an honest effort to study but the turmoil within him was too great in turn he took his place in the reading class and made a botch of it then in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains mountains into rivers and rivers into continents till chaos was come again then in the spelling class and got turned down by a succession of mere baby words till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months chapter vii the harder tom tried to fasten his mind on his book the more his ideas wandered so at last with a sigh and a yawn he gave it up it seemed to him that the noon recess would never come the air was utterly dead there was not a breath stirring it was the sleepiest of sleepy days the drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees away off in the flaming sunshine cardiff hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat tinted with the purple of distance a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air no other living thing was visible but some cows and they were asleep toms heart ached to be free or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time his hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer though he did not know it then furtively the percussion cap box came out he released the tick and put him on the long flat desk the creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer too at this moment but it was premature for when he started thankfully to travel off tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction toms bosom friend sat next him suffering just as tom had been and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant this bosom friend was joe harper the two boys were sworn friends all the week and embattled enemies on saturdays joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner the sport grew in interest momently soon tom said that they were interfering with each other and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick so he put joes slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom now said he as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and i ll let him alone but if you let him get away and get on my side you re to leave him alone as long as i can keep him from crossing over all right go ahead start him up the tick escaped from tom presently and crossed the equator joe harassed him awhile and then he got away and crossed back again this change of base occurred often while one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest the other would look on with interest as strong the two heads bowed together over the slate and the two souls dead to all things else at last luck seemed to settle and abide with joe the tick tried this that and the other course and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp so to speak and toms fingers would be twitching to begin joes pin would deftly head him off and keep possession at last tom could stand it no longer the temptation was too strong so he reached out and lent a hand with his pin joe was angry in a moment said he tom you let him alone i only just want to stir him up a little joe no sir it aint fair you just let him alone blame it i aint going to stir him much let him alone i tell you i wont you shall hes on my side of the line look here joe harper whose is that tick i dont care whose tick he is hes on my side of the line and you shan t touch him well i ll just bet i will though hes my tick and i ll do what i blame please with him or die a tremendous whack came down on toms shoulders and its duplicate on joes and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it the boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them he had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it when school broke up at noon tom flew to becky thatcher and whispered in her ear put on your bonnet and let on you re going home and when you get to the corner give the rest of em the slip and turn down through the lane and come back i ll go the other way and come it over em the same way so the one went off with one group of scholars and the other with another in a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane and when they reached the school they had it all to themselves then they sat together with a slate before them and tom gave becky the pencil and held her hand in his guiding it and so created another surprising house when the interest in art began to wane the two fell to talking tom was swimming in bliss he said do you love rats no i hate them well i do too live ones but i mean dead ones to swing round your head with a string no i dont care for rats much anyway what i like is chewing gum oh i should say so i wish i had some now do you i ve got some i ll let you chew it awhile but you must give it back to me that was agreeable so they chewed it turn about and dangled their legs against the bench in excess of contentment was you ever at a circus said tom yes and my pas going to take me again some time if im good i been to the circus three or four times lots of times church aint shucks to a circus theres things going on at a circus all the time im going to be a clown in a circus when i grow up oh are you that will be nice they re so lovely all spotted up yes thats so and they get slathers of money most a dollar a day ben rogers says say becky was you ever engaged whats that why engaged to be married no would you like to i reckon so i dont know what is it like like why it aint like anything you only just tell a boy you wont ever have anybody but him ever ever ever and then you kiss and thats all anybody can do it kiss what do you kiss for why that you know is to well they always do that everybody why yes everybody thats in love with each other do you remember what i wrote on the slate ye yes what was it i shan t tell you shall i tell you ye yes but some other time no now no not now to morrow oh no now please becky i ll whisper it i ll whisper it ever so easy becky hesitating tom took silence for consent and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly with his mouth close to her ear and then he added now you whisper it to me just the same she resisted for a while and then said you turn your face away so you cant see and then i will but you mustnt ever tell anybody will you tom now you wont will you no indeed indeed i wont now becky he turned his face away she bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and whispered i love you then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches with tom after her and took refuge in a corner at last with her little white apron to her face tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded now becky its all done all over but the kiss dont you be afraid of that it aint anything at all please becky and he tugged at her apron and the hands by and by she gave up and let her hands drop her face all glowing with the struggle came up and submitted tom kissed the red lips and said now its all done becky and always after this you know you aint ever to love anybody but me and you aint ever to marry anybody but me ever never and forever will you no i ll never love anybody but you tom and i ll never marry anybody but you and you aint to ever marry anybody but me either certainly of course thats part of it and always coming to school or when we re going home you re to walk with me when there aint anybody looking and you choose me and i choose you at parties because thats the way you do when you re engaged its so nice i never heard of it before oh its ever so gay why me and amy lawrence the big eyes told tom his blunder and he stopped confused oh tom then i aint the first you ve ever been engaged to the child began to cry tom said oh dont cry becky i dont care for her any more yes you do tom you know you do tom tried to put his arm about her neck but she pushed him away and turned her face to the wall and went on crying tom tried again with soothing words in his mouth and was repulsed again then his pride was up and he strode away and went outside he stood about restless and uneasy for a while glancing at the door every now and then hoping she would repent and come to find him but she did not then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong it was a hard struggle with him to make new advances now but he nerved himself to it and entered she was still standing back there in the corner sobbing with her face to the wall toms heart smote him he went to her and stood a moment not knowing exactly how to proceed then he said hesitatingly becky i i dont care for anybody but you no reply but sobs becky pleadingly becky wont you say something more sobs tom got out his chiefest jewel a brass knob from the top of an andiron and passed it around her so that she could see it and said please becky wont you take it she struck it to the floor then tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far away to return to school no more that day presently becky began to suspect she ran to the door he was not in sight she flew around to the play yard he was not there then she called tom come back tom she listened intently but there was no answer she had no companions but silence and loneliness so she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself and by this time the scholars began to gather again and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long dreary aching afternoon with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with chapter viii tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track of returning scholars and then fell into a moody jog he crossed a small branch two or three times because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit half an hour later he was disappearing behind the douglas mansion on the summit of cardiff hill and the school house was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him he entered a dense wood picked his pathless way to the centre of it and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak there was not even a zephyr stirring the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far off hammering of a wood pecker and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound the boys soul was steeped in melancholy his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings he sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands meditating it seemed to him that life was but a trouble at best and he more than half envied jimmy hodges so lately released it must be very peaceful he thought to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave and nothing to bother and grieve about ever any more if he only had a clean sunday school record he could be willing to go and be done with it all now as to this girl what had he done nothing he had meant the best in the world and been treated like a dog like a very dog she would be sorry some day maybe when it was too late ah if he could only die temporarily but the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape long at a time tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again what if he turned his back now and disappeared mysteriously what if he went away ever so far away into unknown countries beyond the seas and never came back any more how would she feel then the idea of being a clown recurred to him now only to fill him with disgust for frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic no he would be a soldier and return after long years all war worn and illustrious no better still he would join the indians and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the far west and away in the future come back a great chief bristling with feathers hideous with paint and prance into sunday school some drowsy summer morning with a blood curdling war whoop and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy but no there was something gaudier even than this he would be a pirate that was it now his future lay plain before him and glowing with unimaginable splendor how his name would fill the world and make people shudder how gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas in his long low black hulled racer the spirit of the storm with his grisly flag flying at the fore and at the zenith of his fame how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church brown and weather beaten in his black velvet doublet and trunks his great jack boots his crimson sash his belt bristling with horse pistols his crime rusted cutlass at his side his slouch hat with waving plumes his black flag unfurled with the skull and crossbones on it and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings its tom sawyer the pirate the black avenger of the spanish main yes it was settled his career was determined he would run away from home and enter upon it he would start the very next morning therefore he must now begin to get ready he would collect his resources together he went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his barlow knife he soon struck wood that sounded hollow he put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively what hasnt come here come whats here stay here then he scraped away the dirt and exposed a pine shingle he took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure house whose bottom and sides were of shingles in it lay a marble toms astonishment was bound less he scratched his head with a perplexed air and said well that beats anything then he tossed the marble away pettishly and stood cogitating the truth was that a superstition of his had failed here which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible if you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations and left it alone a fortnight and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there meantime no matter how widely they had been separated but now this thing had actually and unquestionably failed toms whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations he had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before it did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before himself but could never find the hiding places afterward he puzzled over the matter some time and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm he thought he would satisfy himself on that point so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnel shaped depression in it he laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called doodle bug doodle bug tell me what i want to know doodle bug doodle bug tell me what i want to know the sand began to work and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright he dasnt tell so it was a witch that done it i just knowed it he well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches so he gave up discouraged but it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away and therefore he went and made a patient search for it but he could not find it now he went back to his treasure house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way saying brother go find your brother he watched where it stopped and went there and looked but it must have fallen short or gone too far so he tried twice more the last repetition was successful the two marbles lay within a foot of each other just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest tom flung off his jacket and trousers turned a suspender into a belt raked away some brush behind the rotten log disclosing a rude bow and arrow a lath sword and a tin trumpet and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away barelegged with fluttering shirt he presently halted under a great elm blew an answering blast and then began to tiptoe and look warily out this way and that he said cautiously to an imaginary company hold my merry men keep hid till i blow now appeared joe harper as airily clad and elaborately armed as tom tom called hold who comes here into sherwood forest without my pass guy of guisborne wants no mans pass who art thou that that dares to hold such language said tom prompting for they talked by the book from memory who art thou that dares to hold such language i indeed i am robin hood as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know then art thou indeed that famous outlaw right gladly will i dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood have at thee they took their lath swords dumped their other traps on the ground struck a fencing attitude foot to foot and began a grave careful combat two up and two down presently tom said now if you ve got the hang go it lively so they went it lively panting and perspiring with the work by and by tom shouted fall fall why dont you fall i shan t why dont you fall yourself you re getting the worst of it why that aint anything i cant fall that aint the way it is in the book the book says then with one back handed stroke he slew poor guy of guisborne you re to turn around and let me hit you in the back there was no getting around the authorities so joe turned received the whack and fell now said joe getting up you got to let me kill you thats fair why i cant do that it aint in the book well its blamed mean thats all well say joe you can be friar tuck or much the millers son and lam me with a quarter staff or i ll be the sheriff of nottingham and you be robin hood a little while and kill me this was satisfactory and so these adventures were carried out then tom became robin hood again and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound and at last joe representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws dragged him sadly forth gave his bow into his feeble hands and tom said where this arrow falls there bury poor robin hood under the greenwood tree then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse the boys dressed themselves hid their accoutrements and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss they said they would rather be outlaws a year in sherwood forest than president of the united states forever chapter ix at half past nine that night tom and sid were sent to bed as usual they said their prayers and sid was soon asleep tom lay awake and waited in restless impatience when it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight he heard the clock strike ten this was despair he would have tossed and fidgeted as his nerves demanded but he was afraid he might wake sid so he lay still and stared up into the dark everything was dismally still by and by out of the stillness little scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves the ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice old beams began to crack mysteriously the stairs creaked faintly evidently spirits were abroad a measured muffled snore issued from aunt pollys chamber and now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate began next the ghastly ticking of a death watch in the wall at the beds head made tom shudder it meant that somebodys days were numbered then the howl of a far off dog rose on the night air and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance tom was in an agony at last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun he began to doze in spite of himself the clock chimed eleven but he did not hear it and then there came mingling with his half formed dreams a most melancholy caterwauling the raising of a neighboring window disturbed him a cry of scat you devil and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunts woodshed brought him wide awake and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the ell on all fours he meowd with caution once or twice as he went then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground huckleberry finn was there with his dead cat the boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom at the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard it was a graveyard of the old fashioned western kind it was on a hill about a mile and a half from the village it had a crazy board fence around it which leaned inward in places and outward the rest of the time but stood upright nowhere grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery all the old graves were sunken in there was not a tombstone on the place round topped worm eaten boards staggered over the graves leaning for support and finding none sacred to the memory of so and so had been painted on them once but it could no longer have been read on the most of them now even if there had been light a faint wind moaned through the trees and tom feared it might be the spirits of the dead complaining at being disturbed the boys talked little and only under their breath for the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits they found the sharp new heap they were seeking and ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time the hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness toms reflections grew oppressive he must force some talk so he said in a whisper hucky do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here huckleberry whispered i wisht i knowed its awful solemn like aint it i bet it is there was a considerable pause while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly then tom whispered say hucky do you reckon hoss williams hears us talking o course he does least his sperrit does tom after a pause i wish id said mister williams but i never meant any harm everybody calls him hoss a body cant be too partic lar how they talk bout these yer dead people tom this was a damper and conversation died again presently tom seized his comrades arm and said sh what is it tom and the two clung together with beating hearts sh there tis again didnt you hear it i there now you hear it lord tom they re coming they re coming sure what ll we do i dono think they ll see us oh tom they can see in the dark same as cats i wisht i hadnt come oh dont be afeard i dont believe they ll bother us we aint doing any harm if we keep perfectly still maybe they wont notice us at all i ll try to tom but lord im all of a shiver listen the boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed a muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard look see there whispered tom what is it its devil fire oh tom this is awful some vague figures approached through the gloom swinging an old fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light presently huckleberry whispered with a shudder its the devils sure enough three of em lordy tom we re goners can you pray i ll try but dont you be afeard they aint going to hurt us now i lay me down to sleep i sh what is it huck they re humans one of em is anyway one of ems old muff potters voice no taint so

again now they re hot cold again hot again red hot they re p inted right this time say huck i know another o them voices its injun joe thats so that murderin half breed id druther they was devils a dern sight what kin they be up to the whisper died wholly out now for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys hiding place here it is said the third voice and the owner of it held the lantern up and revealed the face of young doctor robinson potter and injun joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple of shovels on it they cast down their load and began to open the grave the doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees he was so close the boys could have touched him hurry men he said in a low voice the moon might come out at any moment they growled a response and went on digging for some time there was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and gravel it was very monotonous finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground they pried off the lid with their shovels got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground the moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face the barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it covered with a blanket and bound to its place with the rope potter took out a large spring knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said now the cussed things ready sawbones and you ll just out with another five or here she stays thats the talk said injun joe look here what does this mean said the doctor you required your pay in advance and i ve paid you yes and you done more than that said injun joe approaching the doctor who was now standing five years ago you drove me away from your fathers kitchen one night when i come to ask for something to eat and you said i warnt there for any good and when i swore id get even with you if it took a hundred years your father had me jailed for a vagrant did you think id forget the injun blood aint in me for nothing and now i ve got you and you got to settle you know he was threatening the doctor with his fist in his face by this time the doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground potter dropped his knife and exclaimed here now dont you hit my pard and the next moment he had grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels injun joe sprang to his feet his eyes flaming with passion snatched up potters knife and went creeping catlike and stooping round and round about the combatants seeking an opportunity all at once the doctor flung himself free seized the heavy headboard of williams grave and felled potter to the earth with it and in the same instant the half breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young mans breast he reeled and fell partly upon potter flooding him with his blood and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark presently when the moon emerged again injun joe was standing over the two forms contemplating them the doctor murmured inarticulately gave a long gasp or two and was still the half breed muttered that score is settled damn you then he robbed the body after which he put the fatal knife in potters open right hand and sat down on the dismantled coffin three four five minutes passed and then potter began to stir and moan his hand closed upon the knife he raised it glanced at it and let it fall with a shudder then he sat up pushing the body from him and gazed at it and then around him confusedly his eyes met joes lord how is this joe he said its a dirty business said joe without moving what did you do it for i i never done it look here that kind of talk wont wash potter trembled and grew white i thought id got sober id no business to drink to night but its in my head yet worsen when we started here im all in a muddle cant recollect anything of it hardly tell me joe honest now old feller did i do it joe i never meant to pon my soul and honor i never meant to joe tell me how it was joe oh its awful and him so young and promising why you two was scuffling and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat and then up you come all reeling and staggering like and snatched the knife and jammed it into him just as he fetched you another awful clip and here you ve laid as dead as a wedge til now oh i didnt know what i was a doing i wish i may die this minute if i did it was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement i reckon i never used a weepon in my life before joe i ve fought but never with weepons they ll all say that joe dont tell say you wont tell joe thats a good feller i always liked you joe and stood up for you too dont you remember you wont tell will you joe and the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer and clasped his appealing hands no you ve always been fair and square with me muff potter and i wont go back on you there now thats as fair as a man can say oh joe you re an angel i ll bless you for this the longest day i live and potter began to cry come now thats enough of that this aint any time for blubbering you be off yonder way and i ll go this move now and dont leave any tracks behind you potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run the half breed stood looking after him he muttered if hes as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being he wont think of the knife till hes gone so far he ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself chicken heart two or three minutes later the murdered man the blanketed corpse the lidless coffin and the open grave were under no inspection but the moons the stillness was complete again too chapter x the two boys flew on and on toward the village speechless with horror they glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time apprehensively as if they feared they might be followed every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy and made them catch their breath and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village the barking of the aroused watch dogs seemed to give wings to their feet if we can only get to the old tannery before we break down whispered tom in short catches between breaths i cant stand it much longer huckleberrys hard pantings were his only reply and the boys fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it they gained steadily on it and at last breast to breast they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond by and by their pulses slowed down and tom whispered huckleberry what do you reckon ll come of this if doctor robinson dies i reckon hanging ll come of it do you though why i know it tom tom thought a while then he said who ll tell we what are you talking abouts pose something happened and injun joe didnt hang why hed kill us some time or other just as dead sure as we re a laying here thats just what i was thinking to myself huck if anybody tells let muff potter do it if hes fool enough hes generally drunk enough tom said nothing went on thinking presently he whispered huck muff potter dont know it how can he tell whats the reason he dont know it because hed just got that whack when injun joe done itd you reckon he could see anythingd you reckon he knowed anything by hokey thats so tom and besides look a here maybe that whack done for him no taint likely tom he had liquor in him i could see that and besides he always has well when paps full you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you couldnt phase him he says so his own self so its the same with muff potter of course but if a man was dead sober i reckon maybe that whack might fetch him i dono after another reflective silence tom said hucky you sure you can keep mum tom we got to keep mum you know that that injun devil wouldnt make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats if we was to squeak bout this and they didnt hang him now look a here tom less take and swear to one another thats what we got to do swear to keep mum im agreed its the best thing would you just hold hands and swear that we oh no that wouldnt do for this thats good enough for little rubbishy common things specially with gals cuz they go back on you anyway and blab if they get in a huff but there orter be writing bout a big thing like this and blood toms whole being applauded this idea it was deep and dark and awful the hour the circumstances the surroundings were in keeping with it he picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon light took a little fragment of red keel out of his pocket got the moon on his work and painfully scrawled these lines emphasizing each slow down stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth and letting up the pressure on the up strokes see next page huck finn and tom sawyer swears they will keep mum about this and they wish they may drop down dead in their tracks if they ever tell and rot huckleberry was filled with admiration of toms facility in writing and the sublimity of his language he at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh but tom said hold on dont do that a pins brass it might have verdigrease on it whats verdigrease its p ison thats what it is you just swaller some of it once you ll see so tom unwound the thread from one of his needles and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood in time after many squeezes tom managed to sign his initials using the ball of his little finger for a pen then he showed huckleberry how to make an h and an f and the oath was complete they buried the shingle close to the wall with some dismal ceremonies and incantations and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away a figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building now but they did not notice it tom whispered huckleberry does this keep us from ever telling always of course it does it dont make any difference what happens we got to keep mum wed drop down dead dont you know that yes i reckon thats so they continued to whisper for some little time presently a dog set up a long lugubrious howl just outside within ten feet of them the boys clasped each other suddenly in an agony of fright which of us does he mean gasped huckleberry i dono peep through the crack quick no you tom i cant i cant do it huck please tom there tis again oh lordy im thankful whispered tom i know his voice its bull harbison if mr harbison owned a slave named bull tom would have spoken of him as harbisons bull but a son or a dog of that name was bull harbison oh thats good i tell you tom i was most scared to death id a bet anything it was a stray dog the dog howled again the boys hearts sank once more oh my that aint no bull harbison whispered huckleberry do tom tom quaking with fear yielded and put his eye to the crack his whisper was hardly audible when he said oh huck its a stray dog quick tom quick who does he mean huck he must mean us both we re right together oh tom i reckon we re goners i reckon there aint no mistake bout where i ll go to i been so wicked dad fetch it this comes of playing hookey and doing everything a fellers told not to do i might a been good like sid if id a tried but no i wouldnt of course but if ever i get off this time i lay i ll just waller in sunday schools and tom began to snuffle a little you bad and huckleberry began to snuffle too consound it tom sawyer you re just old pie long side o what i am oh lordy lordy lordy i wisht i only had half your chance tom choked off and whispered look hucky look hes got his back to us hucky looked with joy in his heart well he has by jingoes did he before yes he did but i like a fool never thought oh this is bully you know now who can he mean the howling stopped tom pricked up his ears sh whats that he whispered sounds like like hogs grunting no its somebody snoring tom that is it where bouts is it huck i bleeve its down at tother end sounds so anyway pap used to sleep there sometimes long with the hogs but laws bless you he just lifts things when he snores besides i reckon he aint ever coming back to this town any more the spirit of adventure rose in the boys souls once more hucky do you dast to go if i lead i dont like to much toms pose its injun joe tom quailed but presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys agreed to try with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped so they went tiptoeing stealthily down the one behind the other when they had got to within five steps of the snorer tom stepped on a stick and it broke with a sharp snap the man moaned writhed a little and his face came into the moonlight it was muff potter the boys hearts had stood still and their hopes too when the man moved but their fears passed away now they tip toed out through the broken weather boarding and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word that long lugubrious howl rose on the night air again they turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where potter was lying and facing potter with his nose pointing heavenward oh geeminy its him exclaimed both boys in a breath say tom they say a stray dog come howling around johnny millers house bout midnight as much as two weeks ago and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung the very same evening and there aint anybody dead there yet well i know that and suppose there aint didnt gracie miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next saturday yes but she aint dead and whats more shes getting better too all right you wait and see shes a goner just as dead sure as muff potters a goner thats what the niggers say and they know all about these kind of things huck then they separated cogitating when tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent he undressed with excessive caution and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade he was not aware that the gently snoring sid was awake and had been so for an hour when tom awoke sid was dressed and gone there was a late look in the light a late sense in the atmosphere he was startled why had he not been called persecuted till he was up as usual the thought filled him with bodings within five minutes he was dressed and down stairs feeling sore and drowsy the family were still at table but they had finished breakfast there was no voice of rebuke but there were averted eyes there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprits heart he sat down and tried to seem gay but it was up hill work it roused no smile no response and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths after breakfast his aunt took him aside and tom almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged but it was not so his aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so and finally told him to go on and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave for it was no use for her to try any more this was worse than a thousand whippings and toms heart was sorer now than his body he cried he pleaded for forgiveness promised to reform over and over again and then received his dismissal feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence he left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward sid and so the latters prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary he moped to school gloomy and sad and took his flogging along with joe harper for playing hookey the day before with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles then he betook himself to his seat rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go his elbow was pressing against some hard substance after a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position and took up this object with a sigh it was in a paper he unrolled it a long lingering colossal sigh followed and his heart broke it was his brass andiron knob this final feather broke the camels back chapter xi close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified with the ghastly news no need of the as yet un dreamed of telegraph the tale flew from man to man from group to group from house to house with little less than telegraphic speed of course the schoolmaster gave holi day for that afternoon the town would have thought strangely of him if he had not a gory knife had been found close to the murdered man and it had been recognized by somebody as belonging to muff potter so the story ran and it was said that a belated citizen had come upon potter washing himself in the branch about one or two o clock in the morning and that potter had at once sneaked off suspicious circumstances especially the washing which was not a habit with potter it was also said that the town had been ransacked for this murderer the public are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict but that he could not be found horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction and the sheriff was confident that he would be captured before night all the town was drifting toward the graveyard toms heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else but because an awful unaccountable fascination drew him on arrived at the dreadful place he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle it seemed to him an age since he was there before somebody pinched his arm he turned and his eyes met huckleberrys then both looked elsewhere at once and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance but everybody was talking and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them poor fellow poor young fellow this ought to be a lesson to grave robbers muff potter ll hang for this if they catch him this was the drift of remark and the minister said it was a judgment his hand is here now tom shivered from head to heel for his eye fell upon the stolid face of injun joe at this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle and voices shouted its him its him hes coming himself who who from twenty voices muff potter hallo hes stopped look out hes turning dont let him get away people in the branches of the trees over toms head said he wasnt trying to get away he only looked doubtful and perplexed infernal impudence said a bystander wanted to come and take a quiet look at his work i reckon didnt expect any company the crowd fell apart now and the sheriff came through ostentatiously leading potter by the arm the poor fellows face was haggard and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him when he stood before the murdered man he shook as with a palsy and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears i didnt do it friends he sobbed pon my word and honor i never done it whos accused you shouted a voice this shot seemed to carry home potter lifted his face and looked around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes he saw injun joe and exclaimed oh injun joe you promised me youd never is that your knife and it was thrust before him by the sheriff potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the ground then he said something told met if i didnt come back and get he shuddered then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said tell em joe tell em it aint any use any more then huckleberry and tom stood dumb and staring and heard the stony hearted liar reel off his serene statement they expecting every moment that the clear sky would deliver gods lightnings upon his head and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed and when he had finished and still stood alive and whole their wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoners life faded and vanished away for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that why didnt you leave what did you want to come here for somebody said i couldnt help it i couldnt help it potter moaned i wanted to run away but i couldnt seem to come anywhere but here and he fell to sobbing again injun joe repeated his statement just as calmly a few minutes afterward on the inquest under oath and the boys seeing that the lightnings were still withheld were confirmed in their belief that joe had sold himself to the devil he was now become to them the most balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon and they could not take their fascinated eyes from his face they inwardly resolved to watch him nights when opportunity should offer in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master injun joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a wagon for removal and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd that the wound bled a little the boys thought that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction but they were disappointed for more than one villager remarked it was within three feet of muff potter when it done it toms fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as much as a week after this and at breakfast one morning sid said tom you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me awake half the time tom blanched and dropped his eyes its a bad sign said aunt polly gravely what you got on your mind tom nothing nothingt i know of but the boys hand shook so that he spilled his coffee and you do talk such stuff sid said last night you said its blood its blood thats what it is you said that over and over and you said dont torment me so i ll tell tell what what is it you ll tell everything was swimming before tom there is no telling what might have happened now but luckily the concern passed out of aunt pollys face and she came to toms relief without knowing it she said sho its that dreadful murder i dream about it most every night myself sometimes i dream its me that done it mary said she had been affected much the same way sid seemed satisfied tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could and after that he complained of toothache for a week and tied up his jaws every night he never knew that sid lay nightly watching and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again toms distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded if sid really managed to make anything out of toms disjointed mutterings he kept it to himself it seemed to tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding inquests on dead cats and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind sid noticed that tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises he noticed too that tom never acted as a witness and that was strange and sid did not overlook the fact that tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests and always avoided them when he could sid marvelled but said nothing however even inquests went out of vogue at last and ceased to torture toms conscience every day or two during this time of sorrow tom watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jail window and smuggled such small comforts through to the murderer as he could get hold of the jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village and no guards were afforded for it indeed it was seldom occupied these offerings greatly helped to ease toms conscience the villagers had a strong desire to tar and feather injun joe and ride him on a rail for body snatching but so formidable was his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the matter so it was dropped he had been careful to begin both of his inquest statements with the fight without confessing the grave robbery that preceded it therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present chapter xii one of the reasons why toms mind had drifted away from its secret troubles was that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about becky thatcher had stopped coming to school tom had struggled with his pride a few days and tried to whistle her down the wind but failed he began to find himself hanging around her fathers house nights and feeling very miserable she was ill what if she should die there was distraction in the thought he no longer took an interest in war nor even in piracy the charm of life was gone there was nothing but dreariness left he put his hoop away and his bat there was no joy in them any more his aunt was concerned she began to try all manner of remedies on him she was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new fangled methods of producing health or mending it she was an inveterate experimenter in these things when something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever right away to try it not on herself for she was never ailing but on anybody else that came handy she was a subscriber for all the health periodicals and phrenological frauds and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils all the rot they contained about ventilation and how to go to bed and how to get up and what to eat and what to drink and how much exercise to take and what frame of mind to keep ones self in and what sort of clothing to wear was all gospel to her and she never observed that her health journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before she was as simple hearted and honest as the day was long and so she was an easy victim she gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines and thus armed with death went about on her pale horse metaphorically speaking with hell following after but she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of gilead in disguise to the suffering neighbors the water treatment was new now and toms low condition was a windfall to her she had him out at daylight every morning stood him up in the wood shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file and so brought him to then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and the yellow stains of it came through his pores as tom said yet notwithstanding all this the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected she added hot baths sitz baths shower baths and plunges the boy remained as dismal as a hearse she began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister plasters she calculated his capacity as she would a jugs and filled him up every day with quack cure alls tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time this phase filled the old ladys heart with consternation this indifference must be broken up at any cost now she heard of pain killer for the first time she ordered a lot at once she tasted it and was filled with gratitude it was simply fire in a liquid form she dropped the water treatment and everything else and pinned her faith to pain killer she gave tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result her troubles were instantly at rest her soul at peace again for the indifference was broken up the boy could not have shown a wilder heartier interest if she had built a fire under him tom felt that it was time to wake up this sort of life might be romantic enough in his blighted condition but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it so he thought over various plans for relief and finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of pain killer he asked for it so often that he became a nuisance and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her if it had been sid she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight but since it was tom she watched the bottle clandestinely she found that the medicine did really diminish but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting room floor with it one day tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunts yellow cat came along purring eyeing the teaspoon avariciously and begging for a taste tom said dont ask for it unless you want it peter but peter signified that he did want it you better make sure peter was sure now you ve asked for it and i ll give it to you because there aint anything mean about me but if you find you dont like it you mustnt blame anybody but your own self peter was agreeable so tom pried his mouth open and poured down the pain killer peter sprang a couple of yards in the air and then delivered a war whoop and set off round and round the room banging against furniture upsetting flower pots and making general havoc next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around in a frenzy of enjoyment with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness then he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path aunt polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets deliver a final mighty hurrah and sail through the open window carrying the rest of the flower pots with him the old lady stood petrified with astonishment peering over her glasses tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter tom what on earth ails that cat i dont know aunt gasped the boy why i never see anything like it what did make him act so deed i dont know aunt polly cats always act so when they re having a good time they do do they there was something in the tone that made tom apprehensive yesm that is i believe they do you do yesm the old lady was bending down tom watching with interest emphasized by anxiety too late he divined her drift the handle of the telltale tea spoon was visible under the bed valance aunt polly took it held it up tom winced and dropped his eyes aunt polly raised him by the usual handle his ear and cracked his head soundly with her thimble now sir what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so for i done it out of pity for him because he hadnt any aunt hadnt any aunt you numskull what has that got to do with it heaps because if hed had one shed a burnt him out herself shed a roasted his bowels out of him thout any more feeling than if he was a human aunt polly felt a sudden pang of remorse this was putting the thing in a new light what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy too she began to soften she felt sorry her eyes watered a little and she put her hand on toms head and said gently i was meaning for the best tom and tom it did do you good tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity i know you was meaning for the best aunty and so was i with peter it done him good too i never see him get around so since oh go long with you tom before you aggravate me again and you try and see if you cant be a good boy for once and you neednt take any more medicine tom reached school ahead of time it was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly and now as usual of late he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades he was sick he said and he looked it he tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking down the road presently jeff thatcher hove in sight and toms face lighted he gazed a moment and then turned sorrowfully away when jeff arrived tom accosted him and led up warily to opportunities for remark about becky but the giddy lad never could see the bait tom watched and watched hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one at last frocks ceased to appear and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer then one more frock passed in at the gate and toms heart gave a great bound the next instant he was out and going on like an indian yelling laughing chasing boys jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb throwing handsprings standing on his head doing all the heroic things he could conceive of and keeping a furtive eye out all the while to see if becky thatcher was noticing but she seemed to be unconscious of it all she never looked could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there he carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity came war whooping around snatched a boys cap hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse broke through a group of boys tumbling them in every direction and fell sprawling himself under beckys nose almost upsetting her and she turned with her nose in the air and he heard her say mf some people think they re mighty smart always showing off toms cheeks burned he gathered himself up and sneaked off crushed and crestfallen chapter xiii toms mind was made up now he was gloomy and desperate he was a forsaken friendless boy he said nobody loved him when they found out what they had driven him to perhaps they would be sorry he had tried to do right and get along but they would not let him since nothing would do them but to be rid of him let it be so and let them blame him for the consequences why shouldnt they what right had the friendless to complain yes they had forced him to it at last he would lead a life of crime there was no choice by this time he was far down meadow lane and the bell for school to take up tinkled faintly upon his ear he sobbed now to think he should never never hear that old familiar sound any more it was very hard but it was forced on him since he was driven out into the cold world he must submit but he forgave them then the sobs came thick and fast just at this point he met his souls sworn comrade joe harper hard eyed and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart plainly here were two souls with but a single thought tom wiping his eyes with his sleeve began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to return and ended by hoping that joe would not forget him but it transpired that this was a request which joe had just been going to make of tom and had come to hunt him up for that purpose his mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew nothing about it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go if she felt that way there was nothing for him to do but succumb he hoped she would be happy and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die as the two boys walked sorrowing along they made a new compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their troubles then they began to lay their plans joe was for being a hermit and living on crusts in a remote cave and dying some time of cold and want and grief but after listening to tom he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime and so he consented to be a pirate three miles below st petersburg at a point where the mississippi river was a trifle over a mile wide there was a long narrow wooded island with a shallow bar at the head of it and this offered well as a rendezvous it was not inhabited it lay far over toward the further shore abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest so jacksons island was chosen who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them then they hunted up huckleberry finn and he joined them promptly for all careers were one to him he was indifferent they presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour which was midnight there was a small log raft there which they meant to capture each would bring hooks and lines and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way as became outlaws and before the afternoon was done they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would hear something all who got this vague hint were cautioned to be mum and wait about midnight tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting place it was starlight and very still the mighty river lay like an ocean at rest tom listened a moment but no sound disturbed the quiet then he gave a low distinct whistle it was answered from under the bluff tom whistled twice more these signals were answered in the same way then a guarded voice said who goes there tom sawyer the black avenger of the spanish main name your names huck finn the red handed and joe harper the terror of the seas tom had furnished these titles from his favorite literature tis well give the countersign two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the brooding night blood then tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort there was an easy comfortable path along the shore under the bluff but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate the terror of the seas had brought a side of bacon and had about worn himself out with getting it there finn the red handed had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half cured leaf tobacco and had also brought a few corn cobs to make pipes with but none of the pirates smoked or chewed but himself the black avenger of the spanish main said it would never do to start without some fire that was a wise thought matches were hardly known there in that day they saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk they made an imposing adventure of it saying hist every now and then and suddenly halting with finger on lip moving with hands on imaginary dagger hilts and giving orders in dismal whispers that if the foe stirred to let him have it to the hilt because dead men tell no tales they knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or having a spree but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way they shoved off presently tom in command huck at the after oar and joe at the forward tom stood amidships gloomy browed and with folded arms and gave his orders in a low stern whisper luff and bring her to the wind aye aye sir steady steady y y y steady it is sir let her go off a point point it is sir as the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid stream it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for style and were not intended to mean anything in particular what sails she carrying courses tops ls and flying jib sir send the r yals up lay out aloft there half a dozen of ye foretopmaststunsl lively now aye aye sir shake out that maintogalansl sheets and braces now my hearties aye aye sir hellum a lee hard a port stand by to meet her when she comes port port now men with a will stead y y y steady it is sir the raft drew beyond the middle of the river the boys pointed her head right and then lay on their oars the river was not high so there was not more than a two or three mile current hardly a word was said during the next three quarters of an hour now the raft was passing before the distant town two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay peacefully sleeping beyond the vague vast sweep of star gemmed water unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening the black avenger stood still with folded arms looking his last upon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings and wishing she could see him now abroad on the wild sea facing peril and death with dauntless heart going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips it was but a small strain on his imagination to remove jacksons island beyond eye shot of the village and so he looked his last with a broken and satisfied heart the other pirates were looking their last too and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island but they discovered the danger in time and made shift to avert it about two o clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight part of the little rafts belongings consisted of an old sail and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather as became outlaws they built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest and then cooked some bacon in the frying pan for supper and used up half of the corn pone stock they had brought it seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island far from the haunts of men and they said they never would return to civilization the climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree trunks of their forest temple and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines when the last crisp slice of bacon was gone and the last allowance of corn pone devoured the boys stretched themselves out on the grass filled with contentment they could have found a cooler place but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting campfire aint it gay said joe its nuts said tom what would the boys say if they could see us say well theyd just die to be here hey hucky i reckon so said huckleberry anyways im suited i dont want nothing bettern this i dont ever get enough to eat gen ally and here they cant come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so its just the life for me said tom you dont have to get up mornings and you dont have to go to school and wash and all that blame foolishness you see a pirate dont have to do anything joe when hes ashore but a hermit he has to be praying considerable and then he dont have any fun anyway all by himself that way oh yes thats so said joe but i hadnt thought much about it you know id a good deal rather be a pirate now that i ve tried it you see said tom people dont go much on hermits nowadays like they used to in old times but a pirates always respected and a hermits got to sleep on the hardest place he can find and put sackcloth and ashes on his head and stand out in the rain and what does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for inquired huck i dono but they ve got to do it hermits always do youd have to do that if you was a hermit dernd if i would said huck well what would you do i dono but i wouldnt do that why huck youd have to howd you get around it why i just wouldnt stand it id run away run away well you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit youd be a disgrace the red handed made no response being better employed he had finished gouging out a cob and now he fitted a weed stem to it loaded it with tobacco and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment the other pirates envied him this majestic vice and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly presently huck said what does pirates have to do tom said oh they have just a bully time take ships and burn them and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where theres ghosts and things to watch it and kill everybody in the ships make em walk a plank and they carry the women to the island said joe they dont kill the women no assented tom they dont kill the women they re too noble and the womens always beautiful too and dont they wear the bulliest clothes oh no all gold and silver and di monds said joe with enthusiasm who said huck why the pirates huck scanned his own clothing forlornly i reckon i aint dressed fitten for a pirate said he with a regretful pathos in his voice but i aint got none but these but the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough after they should have begun their adventures they made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs the pipe dropped from the fingers of the red handed and he slept the sleep of the conscience free and the weary the terror of the seas and the black avenger of the spanish main had more difficulty in getting to sleep they said their prayers inwardly and lying down since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud in truth they had a mind not to say them at all but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep but an intruder came now that would not down it was conscience they began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away and next they thought of the stolen meat and then the real torture came they tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities it seemed to them in the end that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only hooking while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing and there was a command against that in the bible so they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing then conscience granted a truce and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep chapter xiv when tom awoke in the morning he wondered where he was he sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around then he comprehended it was the cool gray dawn and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods not a leaf stirred not a sound obtruded upon great natures meditation beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses a white layer of ashes covered the fire and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air joe and huck still slept now far away in the woods a bird called another answered presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself the marvel of nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy a little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf lifting two thirds of his body into the air from time to time and sniffing around then proceeding again for he was measuring tom said and when the worm approached him of its own accord he sat as still as a stone with his hopes rising and falling by turns as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon toms leg and began a journey over him his whole heart was glad for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform now a procession of ants appeared from nowhere in particular and went about their labors one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms and lugged it straight up a tree trunk a brown spotted lady bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade and tom bent down close to it and said lady bug lady bug fly away home your house is on fire your childrens alone and she took wing and went off to see about it which did not surprise the boy for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once a tumblebug came next heaving sturdily at its ball and tom touched the creature to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead the birds were fairly rioting by this time a catbird the northern mocker lit in a tree over toms head and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment then a shrill jay swept down a flash of blue flame and stopped on a twig almost within the boys reach cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the fox kind came skurrying along sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not all nature was wide awake and stirring now long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar they felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water a vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft but this only gratified them since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization they came back to camp wonderfully refreshed glad hearted and ravenous and they soon had the camp fire blazing up again huck found a spring of clear cold water close by and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves and felt that water sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that would be a good enough substitute for coffee while joe was slicing bacon for breakfast tom and huck asked him to hold on a minute they stepped to a promising nook in the river bank and threw in their lines almost immediately they had reward joe had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass a couple of sun perch and a small catfish provisions enough for quite a family they fried the fish with the bacon and were astonished for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before they did not know that the quicker a fresh water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is and they reflected little upon what a sauce open air sleeping open air exercise bathing and a large ingredient of hunger make too they lay around in the shade after breakfast while huck had a smoke and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition they tramped gayly along over decaying logs through tangled underbrush among solemn monarchs of the forest hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape vines now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers they found plenty of things to be delighted with but nothing to be astonished at they discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide they took a swim about every hour so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp they were too hungry to stop to fish but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk but the talk soon began to drag and then died the stillness the solemnity that brooded in the woods and the sense of loneliness began to tell upon the spirits of the boys they fell to thinking a sort of undefined longing crept upon them this took dim shape presently it was budding homesickness even finn the red handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads but they were all ashamed of their weakness and none was brave enough to speak his thought for some time now the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in the distance just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of but now this mysterious sound became more pronounced and forced a recognition the boys started glanced at each other and then each assumed a listening attitude there was a long silence profound and unbroken then a deep sullen boom came floating down out of the distance what is it exclaimed joe under his breath i wonder said tom in a whisper taint thunder said huckleberry in an awed tone becuz thunder hark said tom listen dont talk they waited a time that seemed an age and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush lets go and see they sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town they parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water the little steam ferry boat was about a mile below the village drifting with the current her broad deck seemed crowded with people there were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat but the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboats side and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again i know now exclaimed tom somebodys drownded thats it said huck they done that last summer when bill turner got drownded they shoot a cannon over the water and that makes him come up to the top yes and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in em and set em afloat and wherever theres anybody thats drownded they ll float right there and stop yes i ve heard about that said joe i wonder what makes the bread do that oh it aint the bread so much said tom i reckon its mostly what they say over it before they start it out but they dont say anything over it said huck i ve seen em and they dont well thats funny said tom but maybe they say it to themselves of course they do anybody might know that the other boys agreed that there was reason in what tom said because an ignorant lump of bread uninstructed by an incantation could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity by jings i wish i was over there now said joe i do too said huck id give heaps to know who it is the boys still listened and watched presently a revealing thought flashed through toms mind and he exclaimed boys i know whos drownded its us they felt like heroes in an instant here was a gorgeous triumph they were missed they were mourned hearts were breaking on their account tears were being shed accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged and best of all the departed were the talk of the whole town and the envy of all the boys as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned this was fine it was worth while to be a pirate after all as twilight drew on the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and the skiffs disappeared the pirates returned to camp they were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making they caught fish cooked supper and ate it and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon from their point of view but when the shadows of night closed them in they gradually ceased to talk and sat gazing into the fire with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere the excitement was gone now and tom and joe could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were misgivings came they grew troubled and unhappy a sigh or two escaped unawares by and by joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout feeler as to how the others might look upon a return to civilization not right now but tom withered him with derision huck being uncommitted as yet joined in with tom and the waverer quickly explained and was glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken hearted home sickness clinging to his garments as he could mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment as the night deepened huck began to nod and presently to snore joe followed next tom lay upon his elbow motionless for some time watching the two intently at last he got up cautiously on his knees and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung by the campfire he picked up and inspected several large semi cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore and finally chose two which seemed to suit him then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his red keel one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket and the other he put in joes hat and removed it to a little distance from the owner and he also put into the hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value among them a lump of chalk an india rubber ball three fishhooks and one of that kind of marbles known as a sure nough crystal then he tiptoed his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar chapter xv a few minutes later tom was in the shoal water of the bar wading toward the illinois shore before the depth reached his middle he was halfway over the current would permit no more wading now so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards he swam quartering upstream but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected however he reached the shore finally and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out he put his hand on his jacket pocket found his piece of bark safe and then struck through the woods following the shore with streaming garments shortly before ten o clock he came out into an open place opposite the village and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank everything was quiet under the blinking stars he crept down the bank watching with all his eyes slipped into the water swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did yawl duty at the boats stern he laid himself down under the thwarts and waited panting presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to cast off a minute or two later the skiffs head was standing high up against the boats swell and the voyage was begun tom felt happy in his success for he knew it was the boats last trip for the night at the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped and tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk landing fifty yards downstream out of danger of possible stragglers he flew along unfrequented alleys and shortly found himself at his aunts back fence he climbed over approached the ell and looked in at the sitting room window for a light was burning there there sat aunt polly sid mary and joe harpers mother grouped together talking they were by the bed and the bed was between them and the door tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack he continued pushing cautiously and quaking every time it creaked till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees so he put his head through and began warily what makes the candle blow so said aunt polly tom hurried up why that doors open i believe why of course it is no end of strange things now go long and shut it sid tom disappeared under the bed just in time he lay and breathed himself for a time and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunts foot but as i was saying said aunt polly he warnt bad so to say only misch ee vous only just giddy and harum scarum you know he warnt any more responsible than a colt he never meant any harm and he was the best hearted boy that ever was and she began to cry it was just so with my joe always full of his devilment and up to every kind of mischief but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be and laws bless me to think i went and whipped him for taking that cream never once recollecting that i throwed it out myself because it was sour and i never to see him again in this world never never never poor abused boy and mrs harper sobbed as if her heart would break i hope toms better off where he is said sid but if hed been better in some ways sid tom felt the glare of the old ladys eye though he could not see it not a word against my tom now that hes gone god ll take care of him never you trouble your self sir oh mrs harper i dont know how to give him up i dont know how to give him up he was such a comfort to me although he tormented my old heart out of me most the lord giveth and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord but its so hard oh its so hard only last saturday my joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and i knocked him sprawling little did i know then how soon oh if it was to do over again id hug him and bless him for it yes yes yes i know just how you feel mrs harper i know just exactly how you feel no longer ago than yesterday noon my tom took and filled the cat full of pain killer and i did think the cretur would tear the house down and god forgive me i cracked toms head with my thimble poor boy poor dead boy but hes out of all his troubles now and the last words i ever heard him say was to reproach but this memory was too much for the old lady and she broke entirely down tom was snuffling now himself and more in pity of himself than anybody else he could hear mary crying and putting in a kindly word for him from time to time he began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before still he was sufficiently touched by his aunts grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature too but he resisted and lay still he went on listening and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim then the small raft had been missed next certain boys said the missing lads had promised that the village should hear something soon the wise heads had put this and that together and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below presently but toward noon the raft had been found lodged against the missouri shore some five or six miles below the village and then hope perished they must be drowned else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if not sooner it was believed that the search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred in mid channel since the boys being good swimmers would otherwise have escaped to shore this was wednesday night if the bodies continued missing until sunday all hope would be given over and the funerals would be preached on that morning tom shuddered mrs harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go then with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each others arms and had a good consoling cry and then parted aunt polly was tender far beyond her wont in her goodnight to sid and mary sid snuffled a bit and mary went off crying with all her heart aunt polly knelt down and prayed for tom so touchingly so appealingly and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice that he was weltering in tears again long before she was through he had to keep still long after she went to bed for she kept making broken hearted ejaculations from time to time tossing unrestfully and turning over but at last she was still only moaning a little in her sleep now the boy stole out rose gradually by the bedside shaded the candle light with his hand and stood regarding her his heart was full of pity for her he took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle but something occurred to him and he lingered considering his face lighted with a happy solution of his thought he put the bark hastily in his pocket then he bent over and kissed the faded lips and straightway made his stealthy exit latching the door behind him he threaded his way back to the ferry landing found nobody at large there and walked boldly on board the boat for he knew she was tenantless except that there was a watchman who always turned in and slept like a graven image he untied the skiff at the stern slipped into it and was soon rowing cautiously upstream when he had pulled a mile above the village he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work he hit the landing on the other side neatly for this was a familiar bit of work to him he was moved to capture the skiff arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate but he knew a thorough search would be made for it and that might end in revelations so he stepped ashore and entered the woods he sat down and took a long rest torturing himself meanwhile to keep awake and then started warily down the home stretch the night was far spent it was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island bar he rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the great river with its splendor and then he plunged into the stream a little later he paused dripping upon the threshold of the camp and heard joe say no toms true blue huck and he ll come back he wont desert he knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate and toms too proud for that sort of thing hes up to something or other now i wonder what well the things is ours anyway aint they pretty near but not yet huck the writing says they are if he aint back here to breakfast which he is exclaimed tom with fine dramatic effect stepping grandly into camp a sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided and as the boys set to work upon it tom recounted and adorned his adventures they were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done then tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore chapter xvi after dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar they went about poking sticks into the sand and when they found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole they were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an english walnut they had a famous fried egg feast that night and another on friday morning after breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar and chased each other round and round shedding clothes as they went until they were naked and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar against the stiff current which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun and now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each others faces with their palms gradually approaching each other with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing sputtering laughing and gasping for breath at one and the same time when they were well exhausted they would run out and sprawl on the dry hot sand and lie there and cover themselves up with it and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh colored tights very fairly so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus with three clowns in it for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor next they got their marbles and played knucks and ringtaw and keeps till that amusement grew stale then joe and huck had another swim but tom would not venture because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm he did not venture again until he had found it and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest they gradually wandered apart dropped into the dumps and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun tom found himself writing becky in the sand with his big toe he scratched it out and was angry with himself for his weakness but he wrote it again nevertheless he could not help it he erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them but joes spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection he was so homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it the tears lay very near the surface huck was melancholy too tom was downhearted but tried hard not to show it he had a secret which he was not ready to tell yet but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon he would have to bring it out he said with a great show of cheerfulness i bet theres been pirates on this island before boys we ll explore it again they ve hid treasures here somewhere howd you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver hey but it roused only faint enthusiasm which faded out with no reply tom tried one or two other seductions but they failed too it was discouraging work joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy finally he said oh boys lets give it up i want to go home its so lonesome oh no joe you ll feel better by and by said tom just think of the fishing thats here i dont care for fishing i want to go home but joe there aint such another swimming place anywhere swimmings no good i dont seem to care for it somehow when there aint anybody to say i shan t go in i mean to go home oh shucks baby you want to see your mother i reckon yes i do want to see my mother and you would too if you had one i aint any more baby than you are and joe snuffled a little well we ll let the crybaby go home to his mother wont we huck poor thing does it want to see its mother and so it shall you like it here dont you huck we ll stay wont we huck saidy e s without any heart in it i ll never speak to you again as long as i live said joe rising there now and he moved moodily away and began to dress himself who cares said tom nobody wants you to go long home and get laughed at oh you re a nice pirate huck and me aint crybabies we ll stay wont we huck let him go if he wants to i reckon we can get along without him per aps but tom was uneasy nevertheless and was alarmed to see joe go sullenly on with his dressing and then it was discomforting to see huck eying joes preparations so wistfully and keeping up such an ominous silence presently without a parting word joe began to wade off toward the illinois shore toms heart began to sink he glanced at huck huck could not bear the look and dropped his eyes then he said i want to go too tom it was getting so lonesome anyway and now it ll be worse lets us go too tom i wont you can all go if you want to i mean to stay tom i better go well go long whos hendering you huck began to pick up his scattered clothes he said tom i wisht youd come too now you think it over we ll wait for you when we get to shore well you ll wait a blame long time thats all huck started sorrowfully away and tom stood looking after him with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too he hoped the boys would stop but they still waded slowly on it suddenly dawned on tom that it was become very lonely and still he made one final struggle with his pride and then darted after his comrades yelling wait wait i want to tell you something they presently stopped and turned around when he got to where they were he began unfolding his secret and they listened moodily till at last they saw the point he was driving at and then they set up a warwhoop of applause and said it was splendid and said if he had told them at first they wouldnt have started away he made a plausible excuse but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction the lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will chattering all the time about toms stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it after a dainty egg and fish dinner tom said he wanted to learn to smoke now joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try too so huck made pipes and filled them these novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine and they bit the tongue and were not considered manly anyway now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff charily and with slender confidence the smoke had an unpleasant taste and they gagged a little but tom said why its just as easy if id a knowed this was all id a learnt long ago so would i said joe its just nothing why many a time i ve looked at people smoking and thought well i wish i could do that but i never thought i could said tom thats just the way with me haint it huck you ve heard me talk just that way havent you huck i ll leave it to huck if i havent yes heaps of times said huck well i have too said tom oh hundreds of times once down by the slaughter house dont you remember huck bob tanner was there and johnny miller and jeff thatcher when i said it dont you remember huck bout me saying that yes thats so said huck that was the day after i lost a white alley no twas the day before there i told you so said tom huck recollects it i bleeve i could smoke this pipe all day said joe i dont feel sick neither do i said tom i could smoke it all day but i bet you jeff thatcher couldnt jeff thatcher why hed keel over just with two draws just let him try it once hed see i bet he would and johnny miller i wish could see johnny miller tackle it once oh dont i said joe why i bet you johnny miller couldnt any more do this than nothing just one little snifter would fetch him deed it would joe say i wish the boys could see us now so do i say boys dont say anything about it and some time when they re around i ll come up to you and say joe got a pipe i want a smoke and you ll say kind of careless like as if it warnt anything you ll say yes i got my old pipe and another one but my tobacker aint very good and i ll say oh thats all right if its strong enough and then you ll out with the pipes and we ll light up just as cam and then just see em look by jings that ll be gay tom i wish it was now so do i and when we tell em we learned when we was off pirating wont they wish theyd been along oh i reckon not i ll just bet they will so the talk ran on but presently it began to flag a trifle and grow disjointed the silences widened the expectoration marvellously increased every pore inside the boys cheeks became a spouting fountain they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do and sudden retchings followed every time both boys were looking very pale and miserable now joes pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers toms followed both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main joe said feebly i ve lost my knife i reckon i better go and find it tom said with quivering lips and halting utterance i ll help you you go over that way and i ll hunt around by the spring no you neednt come huck we can find it so huck sat down again and waited an hour then he found it lonesome and went to find his comrades they were wide apart in the woods both very pale both fast asleep but something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it they were not talkative at supper that night they had a humble look and when huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs they said no they were not feeling very well something they ate at dinner had disagreed with them about midnight joe awoke and called the boys there was a brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something the boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling they sat still intent and waiting the solemn hush continued beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished by and by another came a little stronger then another then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks and shuddered with the fancy that the spirit of the night had gone by there was a pause now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade separate and distinct that grew about their feet and it showed three white startled faces too a deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance a sweep of chilly air passed by rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops right over the boys heads they clung together in terror in the thick gloom that followed a few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves quick boys go for the tent exclaimed tom they sprang away stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark no two plunging in the same direction a furious blast roared through the trees making everything sing as it went one blinding flash after another came and peal on peal of deafening thunder and now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground the boys cried out to each other but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly however one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent cold scared and streaming with water but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for they could not talk the old sail flapped so furiously even if the other noises would have allowed them the tempest rose higher and higher and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast the boys seized each others hands and fled with many tumblings and bruises to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank now the battle was at its highest under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness the bending trees the billowy river white with foam the driving spray of spumeflakes the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in ear splitting explosive bursts keen and sharp and unspeakably appalling the storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces burn it up drown it to the treetops blow it away and deafen every creature in it all at one and the same moment it was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in but at last the battle was done and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings and peace resumed her sway the boys went back to camp a good deal awed but they found there was still something to be thankful for because the great sycamore the shelter of their beds was a ruin now blasted by the lightnings and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened everything in camp was drenched the campfire as well for they were but heedless lads like their generation and had made no provision against rain here was matter for dismay for they were soaked through and chilled they were eloquent in their distress but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting so they patiently wrought until with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs they coaxed the fire to burn again then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace and were gladhearted once more they dried their boiled ham and had a feast and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning for there was not a dry spot to sleep on anywhere around as the sun began to steal in upon the boys drowsiness came over them and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep they got scorched out by and by and drearily set about getting breakfast after the meal they felt rusty and stiff jointed and a little homesick once more tom saw the signs and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could but they cared nothing for marbles or circus or swimming or anything he reminded them of the imposing secret and raised a ray of cheer while it lasted he got them interested in a new device this was to knock off being pirates for a while and be indians for a change they were attracted by this idea so it was not long before they were stripped and striped from head to heel with black mud like so many zebras all of them chiefs of course and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an english settlement by and by they separated into three hostile tribes and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops and killed and scalped each other by thousands it was a gory day consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one they assembled in camp toward suppertime hungry and happy but now a difficulty arose hostile indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace there was no other process that ever they had heard of two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates however there was no other way so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed in due form and behold they were glad they had gone into savagery for they had gained something they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable they were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort no they practised cautiously after supper with right fair success and so they spent a jubilant evening they were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the six nations we will leave them to smoke and chatter and brag since we have no further use for them at present chapter xvii but there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil saturday afternoon the harpers and aunt pollys family were being put into mourning with great grief and many tears an unusual quiet possessed the village although it was ordinarily quiet enough in all conscience the villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air and talked little but they sighed often the saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children they had no heart in their sports and gradually gave them up in the afternoon becky thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse yard and feeling very melancholy but she found nothing there to comfort her she soliloquized oh if i only had a brass andiron knob again but i havent got anything now to remember him by and she choked back a little sob presently she stopped and said to herself it was right here oh if it was to do over again i wouldnt say that i wouldnt say it for the whole world but hes gone now i ll never never never see him any more this thought broke her down and she wandered away with tears rolling down her cheeks then quite a group of boys and girls playmates of toms and joes came by and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of how tom did so and so the last time they saw him and how joe said this and that small trifle pregnant with awful prophecy as they could easily see now and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time and then added something like and i was a standing just so just as i am now and as if you was him i was as close as that and he smiled just this way and then something seemed to go all over me like awful you know and i never thought what it meant of course but i can see now then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life and many claimed that dismal distinction and offered evidences more or less tampered with by the witness and when it was ultimately decided who did see the departed last and exchanged the last words with them the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance and were gaped at and envied by all the rest one poor chap who had no other grandeur to offer said with tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance well tom sawyer he licked me once but that bid for glory was a failure most of the boys could say that and so that cheapened the distinction too much the group loitered away still recalling memories of the lost heroes in awed voices when the sunday school hour was finished the next morning the bell began to toll instead of ringing in the usual way it was a very still sabbath and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that lay upon nature the villagers began to gather loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event but there was no whispering in the house only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there none could remember when the little church had been so full before there was finally a waiting pause an expectant dumbness and then aunt polly entered followed by sid and mary and they by the harper family all in deep black and the whole congregation the old minister as well rose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew there was another communing silence broken at intervals by muffled sobs and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed a moving hymn was sung and the text followed i am the resurrection and the life as the service proceeded the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces the winning ways and the rare promise of the lost lads that every soul there thinking he recognized these pictures felt a pang in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always before and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor boys the minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the departed too which illustrated their sweet generous natures and the people could easily see now how noble and beautiful those episodes were and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank rascalities well deserving of the cowhide the congregation became more and more moved as the pathetic tale went on till at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs the preacher himself giving way to his feelings and crying in the pulpit there was a rustle in the gallery which nobody noticed a moment later the church door creaked the minister raised his streaming eyes above his handkerchief and stood transfixed first one and then another pair of eyes followed the ministers and then almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle tom in the lead joe next and huck a ruin of drooping rags sneaking sheepishly in the rear they had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon aunt polly mary and the harpers threw themselves upon their restored ones smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings while poor huck stood abashed and uncomfortable not knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes he wavered and started to slink away but tom seized him and said aunt polly it aint fair somebodys got to be glad to see huck and so they shall im glad to see him poor motherless thing and the loving attentions aunt polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice praise god from whom all blessings flow sing and put your hearts in it and they did old hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst and while it shook the rafters tom sawyer the pirate looked around upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest moment of his life as the sold congregation trooped out they said they would almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear old hundred sung like that once more tom got more cuffs and kisses that day according to aunt pollys varying moods than he had earned before in a year and he hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to god and affection for himself chapter xviii that was toms great secret the scheme to return home with his brother pirates and attend their own funerals they had paddled over to the missouri shore on a log at dusk on saturday landing five or six miles below the village they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight and had then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches at breakfast monday morning aunt polly and mary were very loving to tom and very attentive to his wants there was an unusual amount of talk in the course of it aunt polly said well i dont say it wasnt a fine joke tom to keep everybody suffering most a week so you boys had a good time but it is a pity you could be so hard hearted as to let me suffer so if you could come over on a log to go to your funeral you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warnt dead but only run off yes you could have done that tom said mary and i believe you would if you had thought of it would you tom said aunt polly her face lighting wistfully say now would you if youd thought of it i well i dont know twould a spoiled everything tom i hoped you loved me that much said aunt polly with a grieved tone that discomforted the boy it would have been something if youd cared enough to think of it even if you didnt do it now auntie that aint any harm pleaded mary its only toms giddy way he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything mores the pity sid would have thought and sid would have come and done it too tom you ll look back some day when its too late and wish youd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little now auntie you know i do care for you said tom id know it better if you acted more like it i wish now id thought said tom with a repentant tone but i dreamt about you anyway thats something aint it it aint much a cat does that much but its better than nothing what did you dream why wednesday night i dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed and sid was sitting by the woodbox and mary next to him well so we did so we always do im glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us and i dreamt that joe harpers mother was here why she was here did you dream any more oh lots but its so dim now well try to recollect cant you somehow it seems to me that the wind the wind blowed the the try harder tom the wind did blow something come tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute and then said i ve got it now i ve got it now it blowed the candle mercy on us go on tom go on and it seems to me that you said why i believe that that door go on tom just let me study a moment just a moment oh yes you said you believed the door was open as im sitting here i did didnt i mary go on and then and then well i wont be certain but it seems like as if you made sid go and and well well what did i make him do tom what did i make him do you made him you oh you made him shut it well for the lands sake i never heard the beat of that in all my days dont tell me there aint anything in dreams any more sereny harper shall know of this before im an hour older id like to see her get around this with her rubbage bout superstition go on tom oh its all getting just as bright as day now next you said i warnt bad only mischeevous and harum scarum and not any more responsible than than i think it was a colt or something and so it was well goodness gracious go on tom and then you began to cry so i did so i did not the first time neither and then then mrs harper she began to cry and said joe was just the same and she wished she hadnt whipped him for taking cream when shed throwed it out her own self tom the sperrit was upon you you was a prophesying thats what you was doing land alive go on tom then sid he said he said i dont think i said anything said sid yes you did sid said mary shut your heads and let tom go on what did he say tom he said i think he said he hoped i was better off where i was gone to but if id been better sometimes thered you hear that it was his very words and you shut him up sharp i lay i did there must a been an angel there there was an angel there somewheres and mrs harper told about joe scaring her with a firecracker and you told about peter and the pain killer just as true as i live and then there was a whole lot of talk bout dragging the river for us and bout having the funeral sunday and then you and old miss harper hugged and cried and she went it happened just so it happened just so as sure as im a sitting in these very tracks tom you couldnt told it more like if youd a seen it and then what go on tom then i thought you prayed for me and i could see you and hear every word you said and you went to bed and i was so sorry that i took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark we aint dead we are only off being pirates and put it on the table by the candle and then you looked so good laying there asleep that i thought i went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips did you tom did you i just forgive you everything for that and she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of villains it was very kind even though it was only a dream sid soliloquized just audibly shut up sid a body does just the same in a dream as hed do if he was awake heres a big milum apple i ve been saving for you tom if you was ever found again now go long to school im thankful to the good god and father of us all i ve got you back thats long suffering and merciful to them that believe on him and keep his word though goodness knows im unworthy of it but if only the worthy ones got his blessings and had his hand to help them over the rough places theres few enough would smile here or ever enter into his rest when the long night comes go long sid mary tom take yourselves off you ve hendered me long enough the children left for school and the old lady to call on mrs harper and vanquish her realism with toms marvellous dream sid had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house it was this pretty thin as long a dream as that without any mistakes in it what a hero tom was become now he did not go skipping and prancing but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public eye was on him and indeed it was he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along but they were food and drink to him smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels as proud to be seen with him and tolerated by him as if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all but they were consuming with envy nevertheless they would have given anything to have that swarthy sun tanned skin of his and his glittering notoriety and tom would not have parted with either for a circus at school the children made so much of him and of joe and delivered such eloquent admiration from their eyes that the two heroes were not long in becoming insufferably stuck up they began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners but they only began it was not a thing likely to have an end with imaginations like theirs to furnish material and finally when they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around the very summit of glory was reached tom decided that he could be independent of becky thatcher now glory was sufficient he would live for glory now that he was distinguished maybe she would be wanting to make up well let her she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people presently she arrived tom pretended not to see her he moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates and screaming with laughter when she made a capture but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times too it gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him and so instead of winning him it only set him up the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about presently she gave over skylarking and moved irresolutely about sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward tom then she observed that now tom was talking more particularly to amy lawrence than to any one else she felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once she tried to go away but her feet were treacherous and carried her to the group instead she said to a girl almost at toms elbow with sham vivacity why mary austin you bad girl why didnt you come to sunday school i did come didnt you see me why no did you where did you sit i was in miss peters class where i always go i saw you did you why its funny i didnt see you i wanted to tell you about the picnic oh thats jolly whos going to give it my mas going to let me have one oh goody i hope she ll let me come well she will the picnics for me she ll let anybody come that i want and i want you thats ever so nice when is it going to be by and by maybe about vacation oh wont it be fun you going to have all the girls and boys yes every one thats friends to me or wants to be and she glanced ever so furtively at tom but he talked right along to amy lawrence about the terrible storm on the island and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree all to flinders while he was standing within three feet of it oh may i come said grace miller yes and me said sally rogers yes and me too said susy harper and joe yes and so on with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but tom and amy then tom turned coolly away still talking and took amy with him beckys lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering but the life had gone out of the picnic now and out of everything else she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call a good cry then she sat moody with wounded pride till the bell rang she roused up now with a vindictive cast in her eye and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what shed do at recess tom continued his flirtation with amy with jubilant self satisfaction and he kept drifting about to find becky and lacerate her with the performance at last he spied her but there was a sudden falling of his mercury she was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture book with alfred temple and so absorbed were they and their heads so close together over the book that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides jealousy ran red hot through toms veins he began to hate himself for throwing away the chance becky had offered for a reconciliation he called himself a fool and all the hard names he could think of he wanted to cry with vexation amy chatted happily along as they walked for her heart was singing but toms tongue had lost its function he did not hear what amy was saying and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent which was as often misplaced as otherwise he kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse again and again to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there he could not help it and it maddened him to see as he thought he saw that becky thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living but she did see nevertheless and she knew she was winning her fight too and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered amys happy prattle became intolerable tom hinted at things he had to attend to things that must be done and time was fleeting but in vain the girl chirped on tom thought oh hang her aint i ever going to get rid of her at last he must be attending to those things and she said artlessly that she would be around when school let out and he hastened away hating her for it any other boy tom thought grating his teeth any boy in the whole town but that saint louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy oh all right i licked you the first day you ever saw this town mister and i ll lick you again you just wait till i catch you out i ll just take and and he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy pummelling the air and kicking and gouging oh you do do you you holler nough do you now then let that learn you and so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction tom fled home at noon his conscience could not endure any more of amys grateful happiness and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress becky resumed her picture inspections with alfred but as the minutes dragged along and no tom came to suffer her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest gravity and absentmindedness followed and then melancholy two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep but it was a false hope no tom came at last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadnt carried it so far when poor alfred seeing that he was losing her he did not know how kept exclaiming oh heres a jolly one look at this she lost patience at last and said oh dont bother me i dont care for them and burst into tears and got up and walked away alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her but she said go away and leave me alone cant you i hate you so the boy halted wondering what he could have done for she had said she would look at pictures all through the nooning and she walked on crying then alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse he was humiliated and angry he easily guessed his way to the truth the girl had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon tom sawyer he was far from hating tom the less when this thought occurred to him he wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself toms spelling book fell under his eye here was his opportunity he gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page becky glancing in at a window behind him at the moment saw the act and moved on without discovering herself she started homeward now intending to find tom and tell him tom would be thankful and their troubles would be healed before she was half way home however she had changed her mind the thought of toms treatment of her when she was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame she resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling books account and to hate him forever into the bargain chapter xix tom arrived at home in a dreary mood and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market tom i ve a notion to skin you alive auntie what have i done well you ve done enough here i go over to sereny harper like an old softy expecting im going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream when lo and behold you shed found out from joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night tom i dont know what is to become of a boy that will act like that it makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to sereny harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word this was a new aspect of the thing his smartness of the morning had seemed to tom a good joke before and very ingenious it merely looked mean and shabby now he hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment then he said auntie i wish i hadnt done it but i didnt think oh child you never think you never think of anything but your own selfishness you could think to come all the way over here from jacksons island in the night to laugh at our troubles and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream but you couldnt ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow auntie i know now it was mean but i didnt mean to be mean i didnt honest and besides i didnt come over here to laugh at you that night what did you come for then it was to tell you not to be uneasy about us because we hadnt got drownded tom tom i would be the thankfullest soul in this world if i could believe you ever had as good a thought as that but you know you never did and i know it tom indeed and deed i did auntie i wish i may never stir if i didnt oh tom dont lie dont do it it only makes things a hundred times worse it aint a lie auntie its the truth i wanted to keep you from grieving that was all that made me come id give the whole world to believe that it would cover up a power of sins tom id most be glad youd run off and acted so bad but it aint reasonable because why didnt you tell me child why you see when you got to talking about the funeral i just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church and i couldnt somehow bear to spoil it so i just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum what bark the bark i had wrote on to tell you wed gone pirating i wish now youd waked up when i kissed you i do honest the hard lines in his aunts face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes did you kiss me tom why yes i did are you sure you did tom why yes i did auntie certain sure what did you kiss me for tom because i loved you so and you laid there moaning and i was so sorry the words sounded like truth the old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said kiss me again tom and be off with you to school now and dont bother me any more the moment he was gone she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which tom had gone pirating in then she stopped with it in her hand and said to herself no i dont dare poor boy i reckon hes lied about it but its a blessed blessed lie theres such a comfort come from it i hope the lord i know the lord will forgive him because it was such good heartedness in him to tell it but i dont want to find out its a lie i wont look she put the jacket away and stood by musing a minute twice she put out her hand to take the garment again and twice she refrained once more she ventured and this time she fortified herself with the thought its a good lie its a good lie i wont let it grieve me so she sought the jacket pocket a moment later she was reading toms piece of bark through flowing tears and saying i could forgive the boy now if hed committed a million sins chapter xx there was something about aunt pollys manner when she kissed tom that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again he started to school and had the luck of coming upon becky thatcher at the head of meadow lane his mood always determined his manner without a moments hesitation he ran to her and said i acted mighty mean today becky and im so sorry i wont ever ever do that way again as long as ever i live please make up wont you the girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face i ll thank you to keep yourself to yourself mr thomas sawyer i ll never speak to you again she tossed her head and passed on tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say who cares miss smarty until the right time to say it had gone by so he said nothing but he was in a fine rage nevertheless he moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy and imagining how he would trounce her if she were he presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed she hurled one in return and the angry breach was complete it seemed to becky in her hot resentment that she could hardly wait for school to take in she was so impatient to see tom flogged for the injured spelling book if she had had any lingering notion of exposing alfred temple toms offensive fling had driven it entirely away poor girl she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself the master mr dobbins had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition the darling of his desires was to be a doctor but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting he kept that book under lock and key there was not an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it but the chance never came every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book but no two theories were alike and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case now as becky was passing by the desk which stood near the door she noticed that the key was in the lock it was a precious moment she glanced around found herself alone and the next instant she had the book in her hands the titlepage professor somebodys anatomy carried no information to her mind so she began to turn the leaves she came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece a human figure stark naked at that moment a shadow fell on the page and tom sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture becky snatched at the book to close it and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle she thrust the volume into the desk turned the key and burst out crying with shame and vexation tom sawyer you are just as mean as you can be to sneak up on a person and look at what they re looking at how could i know you was looking at anything you ought to be ashamed of yourself tom sawyer you know you re going to tell on me and oh what shall i do what shall i do i ll be whipped and i never was whipped in school then she stamped her little foot and said be so mean if you want to i know something thats going to happen you just wait and you ll see hateful hateful hateful and she flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying tom stood still rather flustered by this onslaught presently he said to himself what a curious kind of a fool a girl is never been licked in school shucks whats a licking thats just like a girl they re so thin skinned and chicken hearted well of course i aint going to tell old dobbins on this little fool because theres other ways of getting even on her that aint so mean but what of it old dobbins will ask who it was tore his book nobody ll answer then he ll do just the way he always does ask first one and then t other and when he comes to the right girl he ll know it without any telling girls faces always tell on them they aint got any backbone she ll get licked well its a kind of a tight place for becky thatcher because there aint any way out of it tom conned the thing a moment longer and then added all right though shed like to see me in just such a fix let her sweat it out tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside in a few moments the master arrived and school took in tom did not feel a strong interest in his studies every time he stole a glance at the girls side of the room beckys face troubled him considering all things he did not want to pity her and yet it was all he could do to help it he could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name presently the spelling book discovery was made and toms mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings she did not expect that tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself and she was right the denial only seemed to make the thing worse for tom becky supposed she would be glad of that and she tried to believe she was glad of it but she found she was not certain when the worst came to the worst she had an impulse to get up and tell on alfred temple but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still because said she to herself he ll tell about me tearing the picture sure i wouldnt say a word not to save his life tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken hearted for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling book himself in some skylarking bout he had denied it for forms sake and because it was custom and had stuck to the denial from principle a whole hour drifted by the master sat nodding in his throne the air was drowsy with the hum of study by and by mr dobbins straightened himself up yawned then unlocked his desk and reached for his book but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it most of the pupils glanced up languidly but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes mr dobbins fingered his book absently for a while then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read tom shot a glance at becky he had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did with a gun levelled at its head instantly he forgot his quarrel with her quick something must be done done in a flash too but the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention good he had an inspiration he would run and snatch the book spring through the door and fly but his resolution shook for one little instant and the chance was lost the master opened the volume if tom only had the wasted opportunity back again too late there was no help for becky now he said the next moment the master faced the school every eye sank under his gaze there was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear there was silence while one might count ten the master was gathering his wrath then he spoke who tore this book there was not a sound one could have heard a pin drop the stillness continued the master searched face after face for signs of guilt benjamin rogers did you tear this book a denial another pause joseph harper did you another denial toms uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow torture of these proceedings the master scanned the ranks of boys considered a while then turned to the girls amy lawrence a shake of the head gracie miller the same sign susan harper did you do this another negative the next girl was becky thatcher tom was trembling from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the situation rebecca thatcher tom glanced at her face it was white with terror did you tear no look me in the face her hands rose in appeal did you tear this book a thought shot like lightning through toms brain he sprang to his feet and shouted i done it the school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly tom stood a moment to gather his dismembered faculties and when he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise the gratitude the adoration that shone upon him out of poor beckys eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings inspired by the splendor of his own act he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even mr dobbins had ever administered and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done and not count the tedious time as loss either tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against alfred temple for with shame and repentance becky had told him all not forgetting her own treachery but even the longing for vengeance had to give way soon to pleasanter musings and he fell asleep at last with beckys latest words lingering dreamily in his ear tom how could you be so noble chapter xxi vacation was approaching the schoolmaster always severe grew severer and more exacting than ever for he wanted the school to make a good showing on examination day his rod and his ferule were seldom idle now at least among the smaller pupils only the biggest boys and young ladies of eighteen and twenty escaped lashing mr dobbins lashings were very vigorous ones too for although he carried under his wig a perfectly bald and shiny head he had only reached middle age and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle as the great day approached all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings the consequence was that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge they threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief but he kept ahead all the time the retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted at last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory they swore in the signpainters boy told him the scheme and asked his help he had his own reasons for being delighted for the master boarded in his fathers family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him the masters wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled and the signpainters boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on examination evening he would manage the thing while he napped in his chair then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school in the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived at eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers the master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform with his blackboard behind him he was looking tolerably mellow three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils to his left back of the rows of citizens was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening rows of small boys washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort rows of gawky big boys snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms their grandmothers ancient trinkets their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair all the rest of the house was filled with non participating scholars the exercises began a very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited youd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage etc accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order but he got through safely though cruelly scared and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired a little shamefaced girl lisped mary had a little lamb etc performed a compassion inspiring curtsy got her meed of applause and sat down flushed and happy tom sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible give me liberty or give me death speech with fine fury and frantic gesticulation and broke down in the middle of it a ghastly stage fright seized him his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke true he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the houses silence too which was even worse than its sympathy the master frowned and this completed the disaster tom struggled awhile and then retired utterly defeated there was a weak attempt at applause but it died early the boy stood on the burning deck followed also the assyrian came down and other declamatory gems then there were reading exercises and a spelling fight the meagre latin class recited with honor the prime feature of the evening was in order now original compositions by the young ladies each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform cleared her throat held up her manuscript tied with dainty ribbon and proceeded to read with labored attention to expression and punctuation the themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them their grandmothers and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the crusades friendship was one memories of other days religion in history dream land the advantages of culture forms of political government compared and contrasted melancholy filial love heart longings etc etc a prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy another was a wasteful and opulent gush of fine language another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them no matter what the subject might be a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification the glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools and it is not sufficient today it never will be sufficient while the world stands perhaps there is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious but enough of this homely truth is unpalatable let us return to the examination the first composition that was read was one entitled is this then life perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it in the common walks of life with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity imagination is busy sketching rose tinted pictures of joy in fancy the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng the observed of all observers her graceful form arrayed in snowy robes is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance her eye is brightest her step is lightest in the gay assembly in such delicious fancies time quickly glides by and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the elysian world of which she has had such bright dreams how fairy like does everything appear to her enchanted vision each new scene is more charming than the last but after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior all is vanity the flattery which once charmed her soul now grates harshly upon her ear the ballroom has lost its charms and with wasted health and imbittered heart she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul and so forth and so on there was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading accompanied by whispered ejaculations of how sweet how eloquent so true etc and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic then arose a slim melancholy girl whose face had the interesting paleness that comes of pills and indigestion and read a poem two stanzas of it will do a missouri maidens farewell to alabama alabama goodbye i love thee well but yet for a while do i leave thee now sad yes sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell and burning recollections throng my brow for i have wandered through thy flowery woods have roamed and read near tallapoosas stream have listened to tallassees warring floods and wooed on coosas side auroras beam yet shame i not to bear an o erfull heart nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes tis from no stranger land i now must part tis to no strangers left i yield these sighs welcome and home were mine within this state whose vales i leave whose spires fade fast from me and cold must be mine eyes and heart and tete when dear alabama they turn cold on thee there were very few there who knew what tete meant but the poem was very satisfactory nevertheless next appeared a dark complexioned black eyed black haired young lady who paused an impressive moment assumed a tragic expression and began to read in a measured solemn tone a vision dark and tempestuous was night around the throne on high not a single star quivered but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious franklin even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene at such a time so dark so dreary for human sympathy my very spirit sighed but instead thereof my dearest friend my counsellor my comforter and guide my joy in grief my second bliss in joy came to my side she moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancys eden by the romantic and young a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness so soft was her step it failed to make even a sound and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch as other unobtrusive beauties she would have glided away unperceived unsought a strange sadness rested upon her features like icy tears upon the robe of december as she pointed to the contending elements without and bade me contemplate the two beings presented this nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non presbyterians that it took the first prize this composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening the mayor of the village in delivering the prize to the author of it made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most eloquent thing he had ever listened to and that daniel webster himself might well be proud of it it may be remarked in passing that the number of compositions in which the word beauteous was over fondled and human experience referred to as lifes page was up to the usual average now the master mellow almost to the verge of geniality put his chair aside turned his back to the audience and began to draw a map of america on the blackboard to exercise the geography class upon but he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand and a smothered titter rippled over the house he knew what the matter was and set himself to right it he sponged out lines and remade them but he only distorted them more than ever and the tittering was more pronounced he threw his entire attention upon his work now as if determined not to be put down by the mirth he felt that all eyes were fastened upon him he imagined he was succeeding and yet the tittering continued it even manifestly increased and well it might there was a garret above pierced with a scuttle over his head and down through this scuttle came a cat suspended around the haunches by a string she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air the tittering rose higher and higher the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teachers head down down a little lower and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws clung to it and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession and how the light did blaze abroad from the masters bald pate for the signpainters boy had gilded it that broke up the meeting the boys were avenged vacation had come note the pretended compositions quoted in this chapter are taken without alteration from a volume entitled prose and poetry by a western lady but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl pattern and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be chapter xxii tom joined the new order of cadets of temperance being attracted by the showy character of their regalia he promised to abstain from smoking chewing and profanity as long as he remained a member now he found out a new thing namely that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order fourth of july was coming but he soon gave that up gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty eight hours and fixed his hopes upon old judge frazer justice of the peace who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral since he was so high an official during three days tom was deeply concerned about the judges condition and hungry for news of it sometimes his hopes ran high so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking glass but the judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating at last he was pronounced upon the mend and then convalescent tom was disgusted and felt a sense of injury too he handed in his resignation at once and that night the judge suffered a relapse and died tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again the funeral was a fine thing the cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy tom was a free boy again however there was something in that he could drink and swear now but found to his surprise that he did not want to the simple fact that he could took the desire away and the charm of it tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands he attempted a diary but nothing happened during three days and so he abandoned it the first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town and made a sensation tom and joe harper got up a band of performers and were happy for two days even the glorious fourth was in some sense a failure for it rained hard there was no procession in consequence and the greatest man in the world as tom supposed mr benton an actual united states senator proved an overwhelming disappointment for he was not twenty five feet high nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it a circus came the boys played circus for three days afterward in tents made of rag carpeting admission three pins for boys two for girls and then circusing was abandoned a phrenologist and a mesmerizer came and went again and left the village duller and drearier than ever there were some boys and girls parties but they were so few and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder becky thatcher was gone to her constantinople home to stay with her parents during vacation so there was no bright side to life anywhere the dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery it was a very cancer for permanency and pain then came the measles during two long weeks tom lay a prisoner dead to the world and its happenings he was very ill he was interested in nothing when he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature there had been a revival and everybody had got religion not only the adults but even the boys and girls tom went about hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face but disappointment crossed him everywhere he found joe harper studying a testament and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle he sought ben rogers and found him visiting the poor with a basket of tracts he hunted up jim hollis who called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression and when in desperation he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of huckleberry finn and was received with a scriptural quotation his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost forever and forever and that night there came on a terrific storm with driving rain awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning he covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him he believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result it might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself by and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object the boys first impulse was to be grateful and reform his second was to wait for there might not be any more storms the next day the doctors were back tom had relapsed the three weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age when he got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared remembering how lonely was his estate how companionless and forlorn he was he drifted listlessly down the street and found jim hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder in the presence of her victim a bird he found joe harper and huck finn up an alley eating a stolen melon poor lads they like tom had suffered a relapse chapter xxiii at last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred and vigorously the murder trial came on in the court it became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately tom could not get away from it every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as feelers he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip it kept him in a cold shiver all the time he took huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him it would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer moreover he wanted to assure himself that huck had remained discreet huck have you ever told anybody about that bout what you know what oh course i havent never a word never a solitary word so help me what makes you ask well i was afeard why tom sawyer we wouldnt be alive two days if that got found out you know that tom felt more comfortable after a pause huck they couldnt anybody get you to tell could they get me to tell why if i wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they could get me to tell they aint no different way well thats all right then i reckon we re safe as long as we keep mum but lets swear again anyway its more surer im agreed so they swore again with dread solemnities what is the talk around huck i ve heard a power of it talk well its just muff potter muff potter muff potter all the time it keeps me in a sweat constant sos i want to hide som ers thats just the same way they go on round me i reckon hes a goner dont you feel sorry for him sometimes most always most always he aint no account but then he haint ever done anything to hurt anybody just fishes a little to get money to get drunk on and loafs around considerable but lord we all do that leastways most of us preachers and such like but hes kind of good he give me half a fish once when there warnt enough for two and lots of times hes kind of stood by me when i was out of luck well hes mended kites for me huck and knitted hooks on to my line i wish we could get him out of there my we couldnt get him out tom and besides twouldnt do any good theyd ketch him again yes so they would but i hate to hear em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done that i do too tom lord i hear em say hes the bloodiest looking villain in this country and they wonder he wasnt ever hung before yes they talk like that all the time i ve heard em say that if he was to get free theyd lynch him and theyd do it too the boys had a long talk but it brought them little comfort as the twilight drew on they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties but nothing happened there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive the boys did as they had often done before went to the cell grating and gave potter some tobacco and matches he was on the ground floor and there were no guards his gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before it cut deeper than ever this time they felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when potter said you ve been mighty good to me boys bettern anybody else in this town and i dont forget it i dont often i says to myself says i i used to mend all the boys kites and things and show em where the good fishin places was and befriend em what i could and now they ve all forgot old muff when hes in trouble but tom dont and huck dont they dont forget him says i and i dont forget them well boys i done an awful thing drunk and crazy at the time thats the only way i account for it and now i got to swing for it and its right right and best too i reckon hope so anyway well we wont talk about that i dont want to make you feel bad you ve befriended me but what i want to say is dont you ever get drunk then you wont ever get here stand a litter furder west so thats it its a prime comfort to see faces thats friendly when a bodys in such a muck of trouble and there dont none come here but yourn good friendly faces good friendly faces git up on one anothers backs and let me touch em thats it shake hands yourn ll come through the bars but mines too big little hands and weak but they ve helped muff potter a power and theyd help him more if they could tom went home miserable and his dreams that night were full of horrors the next day and the day after he hung about the courtroom drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in but forcing himself to stay out huck was having the same experience they studiously avoided each other each wandered away from time to time but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom but invariably heard distressing news the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor potter at the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that injun joes evidence stood firm and unshaken and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jurys verdict would be tom was out late that night and came to bed through the window he was in a tremendous state of excitement it was hours before he got to sleep all the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning for this was to be the great day both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience after a long wait the jury filed in and took their places shortly afterward potter pale and haggard timid and hopeless was brought in with chains upon him and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him no less conspicuous was injun joe stolid as ever there was another pause and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court the usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed these details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating now a witness was called who testified that he found muff potter washing in the brook at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered and that he immediately sneaked away after some further questioning counsel for the prosecution said take the witness the prisoner raised his eyes for a moment but dropped them again when his own counsel said i have no questions to ask him the next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse counsel for the prosecution said take the witness i have no questions to ask him potters lawyer replied a third witness swore he had often seen the knife in potters possession take the witness counsel for potter declined to question him the faces of the audience began to betray annoyance did this attorney mean to throw away his clients life without an effort several witnesses deposed concerning potters guilty behavior when brought to the scene of the murder they were allowed to leave the stand without being cross questioned every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was brought out by credible witnesses but none of them were cross examined by potters lawyer the perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench counsel for the prosecution now said by the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion we have fastened this awful crime beyond all possibility of question upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar we rest our case here a groan escaped from poor potter and he put his face in his hands and rocked his body softly to and fro while a painful silence reigned in the courtroom many men were moved and many womens compassion testified itself in tears counsel for the defence rose and said your honor in our remarks at the opening of this trial we foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink we have changed our mind we shall not offer that plea then to the clerk call thomas sawyer a puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house not even excepting potters every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand the boy looked wild enough for he was badly scared the oath was administered thomas sawyer where were you on the seventeenth of june about the hour of midnight tom glanced at injun joes iron face and his tongue failed him the audience listened breathless but the words refused to come after a few moments however the boy got a little of his strength back and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear in the graveyard a little bit louder please dont be afraid you were in the graveyard a contemptuous smile flitted across injun joes face were you anywhere near horse williams grave yes sir speak up just a trifle louder how near were you near as i am to you were you hidden or not i was hid where behind the elms thats on the edge of the grave injun joe gave a barely perceptible start any one with you yes sir i went there with wait wait a moment never mind mentioning your companions name we will produce him at the proper time did you carry anything there with you tom hesitated and looked confused speak out my boy dont be diffident the truth is always respectable what did you take there only a a dead cat there was a ripple of mirth which the court checked we will produce the skeleton of that cat now my boy tell us everything that occurred tell it in your own way dont skip anything and dont be afraid tom began hesitatingly at first but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed more and more easily in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice every eye fixed itself upon him with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words taking no note of time rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale the strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said and as the doctor fetched the board around and muff potter fell injun joe jumped with the knife and crash quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window tore his way through all opposers and was gone chapter xxiv tom was a glittering hero once more the pet of the old the envy of the young his name even went into immortal print for the village paper magnified him there were some that believed he would be president yet if he escaped hanging as usual the fickle unreasoning world took muff potter to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before but that sort of conduct is to the worlds credit therefore it is not well to find fault with it toms days were days of splendor and exultation to him but his nights were seasons of horror injun joe infested all his dreams and always with doom in his eye hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall poor huck was in the same state of wretchedness and terror for tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial and huck was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out yet notwithstanding injun joes flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court the poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy but what of that since toms harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyers house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths hucks confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated daily muff potters gratitude made tom glad he had spoken but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue half the time tom was afraid injun joe would never be captured the other half he was afraid he would be he felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse rewards had been offered the country had been scoured but no injun joe was found one of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels a detective came up from st louis moused around shook his head looked wise and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve that is to say he found a clew but you cant hang a clew for murder and so after that detective had got through and gone home tom felt just as insecure as he was before the slow days drifted on and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension chapter xxv there comes a time in every rightly constructed boys life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure this desire suddenly came upon tom one day he sallied out to find joe harper but failed of success next he sought ben rogers he had gone fishing presently he stumbled upon huck finn the red handed huck would answer tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially huck was willing huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money where ll we dig said huck oh most anywhere why is it hid all around no indeed it aint its hid in mighty particular places huck sometimes on islands sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree just where the shadow falls at midnight but mostly under the floor in ha nted houses who hides it why robbers of course whod you reckon sunday school sup rintendents i dont know if twas mine i wouldnt hide it id spend it and have a good time so would i but robbers dont do that way they always hide it and leave it there dont they come after it any more no they think they will but they generally forget the marks or else they die anyway it lays there a long time and gets rusty and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks a paper thats got to be ciphered over about a week because its mostly signs and hy roglyphics hyro which hy roglyphics pictures and things you know that dont seem to mean anything have you got one of them papers tom no well then how you going to find the marks i dont want any marks they always bury it under a ha nted house or on an island or under a dead tree thats got one limb sticking out well we ve tried jacksons island a little and we can try it again some time and theres the old ha nted house up the still house branch and theres lots of dead limb trees dead loads of em is it under all of them how you talk no then how you going to know which one to go for go for all of em why tom it ll take all summer well what of that suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it all rusty and gray or rotten chest full of di monds hows that hucks eyes glowed thats bully plenty bully enough for me just you gimme the hundred dollars and i dont want no di monds all right but i bet you i aint going to throw off on di monds some of ems worth twenty dollars apiece there aint any hardly buts worth six bits or a dollar no is that so cert nly anybody ll tell you so haint you ever seen one huck not as i remember oh kings have slathers of them well i don know no kings tom i reckon you dont but if you was to go to europe youd see a raft of em hopping around do they hop hop your granny no well what did you say they did for shucks i only meant youd see em not hopping of course what do they want to hop for but i mean youd just see em scattered around you know in a kind of a general way like that old humpbacked richard richard whats his other name he didnt have any other name kings dont have any but a given name no but they dont well if they like it tom all right but i dont want to be a king and have only just a given name like a nigger but say where you going to dig first well i dont knows pose we tackle that old dead limb tree on the hill t other side of still house branch im agreed so they got a crippled pick and a shovel and set out on their three mile tramp they arrived hot and panting and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke i like this said tom so do i say huck if we find a treasure here what you going to do with your share well i ll have pie and a glass of soda every day and i ll go to every circus that comes along i bet i ll have a gay time well aint you going to save any of it save it what for why so as to have something to live on by and by oh that aint any use pap would come back to thish yer town some day and get his claws on it if i didnt hurry up and i tell you hed clean it out pretty quick what you going to do with yourn tom im going to buy a new drum and a sure nough sword and a red necktie and a bull pup and get married married thats it tom you why you aint in your right mind wait you ll see well thats the foolishest thing you could do look at pap and my mother fight why they used to fight all the time i remember mighty well that aint anything the girl im going to marry wont fight tom i reckon they re all alike they ll all comb a body now you better think bout this awhile i tell you you better whats the name of the gal it aint a gal at all its a girl its all the same i reckon some says gal some says girl boths right like enough anyway whats her name tom i ll tell you some time not now all right that ll do only if you get married i ll be more lonesomer than ever no you wont you ll come and live with me now stir out of this and we ll go to digging they worked and sweated for half an hour no result they toiled another halfhour still no result huck said do they always bury it as deep as this sometimes not always not generally i reckon we havent got the right place so they chose a new spot and began again the labor dragged a little but still they made progress they pegged away in silence for some time finally huck leaned on his shovel swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve and said where you going to dig next after we get this one i reckon maybe we ll tackle the old tree thats over yonder on cardiff hill back of the widows i reckon that ll be a good one but wont the widow take it away from us tom its on her land she take it away maybe shed like to try it once whoever finds one of these hid treasures it belongs to him it dont make any difference whose land its on that was satisfactory the work went on by and by huck said blame it we must be in the wrong place again what do you think it is mighty curious huck i dont understand it sometimes witches interfere i reckon maybe thats whats the trouble now shucks witches aint got no power in the daytime well thats so i didnt think of that oh i know what the matter is what a blamed lot of fools we are you got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight and thats where you dig then consound it we ve fooled away all this work for nothing now hang it all we got to come back in the night its an awful long way can you get out i bet i will we ve got to do it tonight too because if somebody sees these holes they ll know in a minute whats here and they ll go for it well i ll come around and maow tonight all right lets hide the tools in the bushes the boys were there that night about the appointed time they sat in the shadow waiting it was a lonely place and an hour made solemn by old traditions spirits whispered in the rustling leaves ghosts lurked in the murky nooks the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance an owl answered with his sepulchral note the boys were subdued by these solemnities and talked little by and by they judged that twelve had come they marked where the shadow fell and began to dig their hopes commenced to rise their interest grew stronger and their industry kept pace with it the hole deepened and still deepened but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something they only suffered a new disappointment it was only a stone or a chunk at last tom said it aint any use huck we re wrong again well but we cant be wrong we spotted the shadder to a dot i know it but then theres another thing whats that why we only guessed at the time like enough it was too late or too early huck dropped his shovel thats it said he thats the very trouble we got to give this one up we cant ever tell the right time and besides this kind of things too awful here this time of night with witches and ghosts a fluttering around so i feel as if somethings behind me all the time and im afeard to turn around becuz maybe theres others in front a waiting for a chance i been creeping all over ever since i got here well i ve been pretty much so too huck they most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree to look out for it lordy yes they do i ve always heard that tom i dont like to fool around much where theres dead people a bodys bound to get into trouble with em sure i dont like to stir em up eithers pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something dont tom its awful well it just is huck i dont feel comfortable a bit say tom lets give this place up and try somewheres else all right i reckon we better what ll it be tom considered awhile and then said the ha nted house thats it blame it i dont like ha nted houses tom why they re a dern sight worsen dead people dead people might talk maybe but they dont come sliding around in a shroud when you aint noticing and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth the way a ghost does i couldnt stand such a thing as that tom nobody could yes but huck ghosts dont travel around only at night they wont hender us from digging there in the daytime well thats so but you know mighty well people dont go about that ha nted house in the day nor the night well thats mostly because they dont like to go where a mans been murdered anyway but nothings ever been seen around that house except in the night just some blue lights slipping by the windows no regular ghosts well where you see one of them blue lights flickering around tom you can bet theres a ghost mighty close behind it it stands to reason becuz you know that they dont anybody but ghosts use em yes thats so but anyway they dont come around in the daytime so whats the use of our being afeard well all right we ll tackle the ha nted house if you say so but i reckon its taking chances they had started down the hill by this time there in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the ha nted house utterly isolated its fences gone long ago rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps the chimney crumbled to ruin the window sashes vacant a corner of the roof caved in the boys gazed awhile half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window then talking in a low tone as befitted the time and the circumstances they struck far off to the right to give the haunted house a wide berth and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of cardiff hill chapter xvi about noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree they had come for their tools tom was impatient to go to the haunted house huck was measurably so also but suddenly said lookyhere tom do you know what day it is tom mentally ran over the days of the week and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them my i never once thought of it huck well i didnt neither but all at once it popped onto me that it was friday blame it a body cant be too careful huck we might a got into an awful scrape tackling such a thing on a friday might better say we would theres some lucky days maybe but friday aint any fool knows that i dont reckon you was the first that found it out huck well i never said i was did i and friday aint all neither i had a rotten bad dream last night dreampt about rats no sure sign of trouble did they fight no well thats good huck when they dont fight its only a sign that theres trouble around you know all we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it we ll drop this thing for today and play do you know robin hood huck no whos robin hood why he was one of the greatest men that was ever in england and the best he was a robber cracky i wisht i was who did he rob only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings and such like but he never bothered the poor he loved em he always divided up with em perfectly square well he must a been a brick i bet you he was huck oh he was the noblest man that ever was they aint any such men now i can tell you he could lick any man in england with one hand tied behind him and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten cent piece every time a mile and a half whats a yew bow i dont know its some kind of a bow of course and if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry and curse but we ll play robin hood its nobby fun i ll learn you im agreed so they played robin hood all the afternoon now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrows prospects and possibilities there as the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of cardiff hill on saturday shortly after noon the boys were at the dead tree again they had a smoke and a chat in the shade and then dug a little in their last hole not with great hope but merely because tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel the thing failed this time however so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure hunting when they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place that they were afraid for a moment to venture in then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep they saw a weedgrown floorless room unplastered an ancient fireplace vacant windows a ruinous staircase and here there and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs they presently entered softly with quickened pulses talking in whispers ears alert to catch the slightest sound and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat in a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination rather admiring their own boldness and wondering at it too next they wanted to look upstairs this was something like cutting off retreat but they got to daring each other and of course there could be but one result they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent up there were the same signs of decay in one corner they found a closet that promised mystery but the promise was a fraud there was nothing in it their courage was up now and well in hand they were about to go down and begin work when sh said tom what is it whispered huck blanching with fright sh there hear it yes oh my lets run keep still dont you budge they re coming right toward the door the boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the planking and lay waiting in a misery of fear they ve stopped no coming here they are dont whisper another word huck my goodness i wish i was out of this two men entered each boy said to himself theres the old deaf and dumb spaniard thats been about town once or twice lately never saw t other man before t other was a ragged unkempt creature with nothing very pleasant in his face the spaniard was wrapped in a serape he had bushy white whiskers long white hair flowed from under his sombrero and he wore green goggles when they came int other was talking in a low voice they sat down on the ground facing the door with their backs to the wall and the speaker continued his remarks his manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded no said he i ve thought it all over and i dont like it its dangerous dangerous grunted the deaf and dumb spaniard to the vast surprise of the boys milksop this voice made the boys gasp and quake it was injun joes there was silence for some time then joe said whats any more dangerous than that job up yonder but nothings come of it thats different away up the river so and not another house about twont ever be known that we tried anyway long as we didnt succeed well whats more dangerous than coming here in the daytime anybody would suspicion us that saw us i know that but there warnt any other place as handy after that fool of a job i want to quit this shanty i wanted to yesterday only it warnt any use trying to stir out of here with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view those infernal boys quaked again under the inspiration of this remark and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was friday and concluded to wait a day they wished in their hearts they had waited a year the two men got out some food and made a luncheon after a long and thoughtful silence injun joe said look here lad you go back up the river where you belong wait there till you hear from me i ll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more for a look we ll do that dangerous job after i ve spied around a little and think things look well for it then for texas we ll leg it together this was satisfactory both men presently fell to yawning and injun joe said im dead for sleep its your turn to watch he curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore his comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet presently the watcher began to nod his head drooped lower and lower both men began to snore now the boys drew a long grateful breath tom whispered nows our chance come huck said i cant id die if they was to wake tom urged huck held back at last tom rose slowly and softly and started alone but the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright he never made a second attempt the boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting now one snore ceased injun joe sat up stared around smiled grimly upon his comrade whose head was drooping upon his knees stirred him up with his foot and said here you re a watchman aint you all right though nothings happened my have i been asleep oh partly partly nearly time for us to be moving pard what ll we do with what little swag we ve got left i dont know leave it here as we ve always done i reckon no use to take it away till we start south six hundred and fifty in silvers something to carry well all right it wont matter to come here once more no but id say come in the night as we used to do its better yes but look here it may be a good while before i get the right chance at that job accidents might happen taint in such a very good place we ll just regularly bury it and bury it deep good idea said the comrade who walked across the room knelt down raised one of the rearward hearth stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly he subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for injun joe and passed the bag to the latter who was on his knees in the corner now digging with his bowie knife the boys forgot all their fears all their miseries in an instant with gloating eyes they watched every movement luck the splendor of it was beyond all imagination six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich here was treasure hunting under the happiest auspices there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig they nudged each other every moment eloquent nudges and easily understood for they simply meant oh but aint you glad now we re here joes knife struck upon something hello said he what is it said his comrade half rotten plank no its a box i believe here bear a hand and we ll see what its here for never mind i ve broke a hole he reached his hand in and drew it out man its money the two men examined the handful of coins they were gold the boys above were as excited as themselves and as delighted joes comrade said we ll make quick work of this theres an old rusty pick over amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace i saw it a minute ago he ran and brought the boys pick and shovel injun joe took the pick looked it over critically shook his head muttered something to himself and then began to use it the box was soon unearthed it was not very large it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it the men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence pard theres thousands of dollars here said injun joe twas always said that murrels gang used to be around here one summer the stranger observed i know it said injun joe and this looks like it i should say now you wont need to do that job the halfbreed frowned said he you dont know me least you dont know all about that thing taint robbery altogether its revenge and a wicked light flamed in his eyes i ll need your help in it when its finished then texas go home to your nance and your kids and stand by till you hear from me well if you say so what ll we do with this bury it again yes ravishing delight overhead no by the great sachem no profound distress overhead id nearly forgot that pick had fresh earth on it the boys were sick with terror in a moment what business has a pick and a shovel here what business with fresh earth on them who brought them here and where are they gone have you heard anybody seen anybody what bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed not exactly not exactly we ll take it to my den why of course might have thought of that before you mean number one no number two under the cross the other place is bad too common all right its nearly dark enough to start injun joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out presently he said who could have brought those tools here do you reckon they can be upstairs the boys breath forsook them injun joe put his hand on his knife halted a moment undecided and then turned toward the stairway the boys thought of the closet but their strength was gone the steps came creaking up the stairs the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads they were about to spring for the closet when there was a crash of rotten timbers and injun joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway he gathered himself up cursing and his comrade said now whats the use of all that if its anybody and they re up there let them stay there who cares if they want to jump down now and get into trouble who objects it will be dark in fifteen minutes and then let them follow us if they want to im willing in my opinion whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something i ll bet they re running yet joe grumbled awhile then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight and moved toward the river with their precious box tom and huck rose up weak but vastly relieved and stared after them through the chinks between the logs of the house follow not they they were content to reach ground again without broken necks and take the townward track over the hill they did not talk much they were too much absorbed in hating themselves hating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there but for that injun joe never would have suspected he would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his revenge was satisfied and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing bitter bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there they resolved to keep a lookout for that spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job and follow him to number two wherever that might be then a ghastly thought occurred to tom revenge what if he means us huck oh dont said huck nearly fainting they talked it all over and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody else at least that he might at least mean nobody but tom since only tom had testified very very small comfort it was to tom to be alone in danger company would be a palpable improvement he thought chapter xxvii the adventure of the day mightily tormented toms dreams that night four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune as he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away somewhat as if they had happened in another world or in a time long gone by then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream there was one very strong argument in favor of this idea namely that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real he had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before and he was like all boys of his age and station in life in that he imagined that all references to hundreds and thousands were mere fanciful forms of speech and that no such sums really existed in the world he never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any ones possession if his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague splendid ungraspable dollars but the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking them over and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream after all this uncertainty must be swept away he would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find huck huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy tom concluded to let huck lead up to the subject if he did not do it then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream hello huck hello yourself silence for a minute tom if wed a left the blame tools at the dead tree wed a got the money oh aint it awful taint a dream then taint a dream somehow i most wish it was dogd if i dont huck what aint a dream oh that thing yesterday i been half thinking it was dream if them stairs hadnt broke down youd a seen how much dream it was i ve had dreams enough all night with that patch eyed spanish devil going for me all through em rot him no not rot him find him track the money tom we ll never find him a feller dont have only one chance for such a pile and that ones lost id feel mighty shaky if i was to see him anyway well sod i but id like to see him anyway and track him out to his number two number two yes thats it i been thinking bout that but i cant make nothing out of it what do you reckon it is i dono its too deep say huck maybe its the number of a house goody no tom that aint it if it is it aint in this one horse town they aint no numbers here well thats so lemme think a minute here its the number of a room in a tavern you know oh thats the trick they aint only two taverns we can find out quick you stay here huck till i come tom was off at once he did not care to have hucks company in public places he was gone half an hour he found that in the best tavern no had long been occupied by a young lawyer and was still so occupied in the less ostentatious house no was a mystery the tavern keepers young son said it was kept locked all the time and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night he did not know any particular reason for this state of things had had some little curiosity but it was rather feeble had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was ha nted had noticed that there was a light in there the night before thats what i ve found out huck i reckon thats the very no we re after i reckon it is tom now what you going to do lemme think tom thought a long time then he said i ll tell you the back door of that no is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find and i ll nip all of aunties and the first dark night we ll go there and try em and mind you keep a lookout for injun joe because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge if you see him you just follow him and if he dont go to that no that aint the place lordy i dont want to foller him by myself why it ll be night sure he mightnt ever see you and if he did maybe hed never think anything well if its pretty dark i reckon i ll track him i dono i dono i ll try you bet i ll follow him if its dark huck why he might a found out he couldnt get his revenge and be going right after that money its so tom its so i ll foller him i will by jingoes now you re talking dont you ever weaken huck and i wont chapter xxviii that night tom and huck were ready for their adventure they hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door nobody entered the alley or left it nobody resembling the spaniard entered or left the tavern door the night promised to be a fair one so tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on huck was to come and maow whereupon he would slip out and try the keys but the night remained clear and huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve tuesday the boys had the same ill luck also wednesday but thursday night promised better tom slipped out in good season with his aunts old tin lantern and a large towel to blindfold it with he hid the lantern in hucks sugar hogshead and the watch began an hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights the only ones thereabouts were put out no spaniard had been seen nobody had entered or left the alley everything was auspicious the blackness of darkness reigned the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder tom got his lantern lit it in the hogshead wrapped it closely in the towel and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern huck stood sentry and tom felt his way into the alley then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon hucks spirits like a mountain he began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern it would frighten him but it would at least tell him that tom was alive yet it seemed hours since tom had disappeared surely he must have fainted maybe he was dead maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement in his uneasiness huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley fearing all sorts of dreadful things and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath there was not much to take away for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls and his heart would soon wear itself out the way it was beating suddenly there was a flash of light and tom came tearing by him run said he run for your life he neednt have repeated it once was enough huck was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered the boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter house at the lower end of the village just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down as soon as tom got his breath he said huck it was awful i tried two of the keys just as soft as i could but they seemed to make such a power of racket that i couldnt hardly get my breath i was so scared they wouldnt turn in the lock either well without noticing what i was doing i took hold of the knob and open comes the door it warnt locked i hopped in and shook off the towel and great caesars ghost what whatd you see tom huck i most stepped onto injun joes hand no yes he was lying there sound asleep on the floor with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out lordy what did you do did he wake up no never budged drunk i reckon i just grabbed that towel and started id never a thought of the towel i bet well i would my aunt would make me mighty sick if i lost it say tom did you see that box huck i didnt wait to look around i didnt see the box i didnt see the cross i didnt see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by injun joe yes i saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room dont you see now whats the matter with that ha nted room how why its ha nted with whiskey maybe all the temperance taverns have got a ha nted room hey huck well i reckon maybe thats so whod a thought such a thing but say tom nows a mighty good time to get that box if injun joes drunk it is that you try it huck shuddered well no i reckon not and i reckon not huck only one bottle alongside of injun joe aint enough if thered been three hed be drunk enough and id do it there was a long pause for reflection and then tom said lookyhere huck less not try that thing any more till we know injun joes not in there its too scary now if we watch every night we ll be dead sure to see him go out some time or other and then we ll snatch that box quickern lightning well im agreed i ll watch the whole night long and i ll do it every night too if you ll do the other part of the job all right i will all you got to do is to trot up hooper street a block and maow and if im asleep you throw some gravel at the window and that ll fetch me agreed and good as wheat now huck the storms over and i ll go home it ll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours you go back and watch that long will you i said i would tom and i will i ll ha nt that tavern every night for a year i ll sleep all day and i ll stand watch all night thats all right now where you going to sleep in ben rogers hayloft he lets me and so does his paps nigger man uncle jake i tote water for uncle jake whenever he wants me to and any time i ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it thats a mighty good nigger tom he likes me becuz i dont ever act as if i was above him sometime i ve set right down and eat with him but you neednt tell that a bodys got to do things when hes awful hungry he wouldnt want to do as a steady thing well if i dont want you in the daytime i ll let you sleep i wont come bothering around any time you see somethings up in the night just skip right around and maow chapter xxix the first thing tom heard on friday morning was a glad piece of news judge thatchers family had come back to town the night before both injun joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment and becky took the chief place in the boys interest he saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing hispy and gully keeper with a crowd of their schoolmates the day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long promised and long delayed picnic and she consented the childs delight was boundless and toms not more moderate the invitations were sent out before sunset and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation toms excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour and he had good hopes of hearing hucks maow and of having his treasure to astonish becky and the picnickers with next day but he was disappointed no signal came that night morning came eventually and by ten or eleven o clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at judge thatchers and everything was ready for a start it was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence the children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty three or thereabouts the old steam ferry boat was chartered for the occasion presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision baskets sid was sick and had to miss the fun mary remained at home to entertain him the last thing mrs thatcher said to becky was you ll not get back till late perhaps youd better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry landing child then i ll stay with susy harper mamma very well and mind and behave yourself and dont be any trouble presently as they tripped along tom said to becky say i ll tell you what we ll do stead of going to joe harpers we ll climb right up the hill and stop at the widow douglas she ll have ice cream she has it most every day dead loads of it and she ll be awful glad to have us oh that will be fun then becky reflected a moment and said but what will mamma say how ll she ever know the girl turned the idea over in her mind and said reluctantly i reckon its wrong but but shucks your mother wont know and so whats the harm all she wants is that you ll be safe and i bet you shed a said go there if shed a thought of it i know she would the widow douglas splendid hospitality was a tempting bait it and toms persuasions presently carried the day so it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the nights programme presently it occurred to tom that maybe huck might come this very night and give the signal the thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations still he could not bear to give up the fun at widow douglas and why should he give it up he reasoned the signal did not come the night before so why should it be any more likely to come tonight the sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure and boy like he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up the crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter all the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with and by and by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites and then the destruction of the good things began after the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks by and by somebody shouted whos ready for the cave everybody was bundles of candles were procured and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill the mouth of the cave was up the hillside an opening shaped like a letter a its massive oaken door stood unbarred within was a small chamber chilly as an icehouse and walled by nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat it was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun but the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off and the romping began again the moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it a struggle and a gallant defence followed but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase but all things have an end by and by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead this main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand for mcdougals cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere it was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms and never find the end of the cave and that he might go down and down and still down into the earth and it was just the same labyrinth under labyrinth and no end to any of them no man knew the cave that was an impossible thing most of the young men knew a portion of it and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion tom sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one the procession moved along the main avenue some three quarters of a mile and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues fly along the dismal corridors and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the known ground by and by one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave panting hilarious smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings daubed with clay and entirely delighted with the success of the day then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand the clanging bell had been calling for half an hour however this sort of close to the days adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory when the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboats lights went glinting past the wharf he heard no noise on board for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death he wondered what boat it was and why she did not stop at the wharf and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business the night was growing cloudy and dark ten o clock came and the noise of vehicles ceased scattered lights began to wink out all straggling foot passengers disappeared the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts eleven o clock came and the tavern lights were put out darkness everywhere now huck waited what seemed a weary long time but nothing happened his faith was weakening was there any use was there really any use why not give it up and turn in a noise fell upon his ear he was all attention in an instant the alley door closed softly he sprang to the corner of the brick store the next moment two men brushed by him and one seemed to have something under his arm it must be that box so they were going to remove the treasure why call tom now it would be absurd the men would get away with the box and never be found again no he would stick to their wake and follow them he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery so communing with himself huck stepped out and glided along behind the men cat like with bare feet allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible they moved up the river street three blocks then turned to the left up a crossstreet they went straight ahead then until they came to the path that led up cardiff hill this they took they passed by the old welshmans house halfway up the hill without hesitating and still climbed upward good thought huck they will bury it in the old quarry but they never stopped at the quarry they passed on up the summit they plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes and were at once hidden in the gloom huck closed up and shortened his distance now for they would never be able to see him he trotted along awhile then slackened his pace fearing he was gaining too fast moved on a piece then stopped altogether listened no sound none save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart the hooting of an owl came over the hill ominous sound but no footsteps heavens was everything lost he was about to spring with winged feet when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him hucks heart shot into his throat but he swallowed it again and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground he knew where he was he knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into widow douglas grounds very well he thought let them bury it there it wont be hard to find now there was a voice a very low voice injun joes damn her maybe shes got company theres lights late as it is i cant see any this was that strangers voice the stranger of the haunted house a deadly chill went to hucks heart this then was the revenge job his thought was to fly then he remembered that the widow douglas had been kind to him more than once and maybe these men were going to murder her he wished he dared venture to warn her but he knew he didnt dare they might come and catch him he thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the strangers remark and injun joes next which was because the bush is in your way now this way now you see dont you yes well there is company there i reckon better give it up give it up and i just leaving this country forever give it up and maybe never have another chance i tell you again as i ve told you before i dont care for her swag you may have it but her husband was rough on me many times he was rough on me and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant and that aint all it aint a millionth part of it he had me horsewhipped horsewhipped in front of the jail like a nigger with all the town looking on horsewhipped do you understand he took advantage of me and died but i ll take it out of her oh dont kill her dont do that kill who said anything about killing i would kill him if he was here but not her when you want to get revenge on a woman you dont kill her bosh you go for her looks you slit her nostrils you notch her ears like a sow by god thats keep your opinion to yourself it will be safest for you i ll tie her to the bed if she bleeds to death is that my fault i ll not cry if she does my friend you ll help me in this thing for my sake thats why you re here i mightnt be able alone if you flinch i ll kill you do you

in a shiver do it now and company there look here i ll get suspicious of you first thing you know no we ll wait till the lights are out theres no hurry huck felt that a silence was going to ensue a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back planted his foot carefully and firmly after balancing one legged in a precarious way and almost toppling over first on one side and then on the other he took another step back with the same elaboration and the same risks then another and another and a twig snapped under his foot his breath stopped and he listened there was no sound the stillness was perfect his gratitude was measureless now he turned in his tracks between the walls of sumach bushes turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship and then stepped quickly but cautiously along when he emerged at the quarry he felt secure and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew down down he sped till he reached the welshmans he banged at the door and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows whats the row there whos banging what do you want let me in quick i ll tell everything why who are you huckleberry finn quick let me in huckleberry finn indeed it aint a name to open many doors i judge but let him in lads and lets see whats the trouble please dont ever tell i told you were hucks first words when he got in please dont id be killed sure but the widows been good friends to me sometimes and i want to tell i will tell if you ll promise you wont ever say it was me by george he has got something to tell or he wouldnt act so exclaimed the old man out with it and nobody here ll ever tell lad three minutes later the old man and his sons well armed were up the hill and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe their weapons in their hands huck accompanied them no further he hid behind a great bowlder and fell to listening there was a lagging anxious silence and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry huck waited for no particulars he sprang away and sped down the hill as fast as his legs could carry him chapter xxx as the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on sunday morning huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old welshmans door the inmates were asleep but it was a sleep that was set on a hair trigger on account of the exciting episode of the night a call came from a window whos there hucks scared voice answered in a low tone please let me in its only huck finn its a name that can open this door night or day lad and welcome these were strange words to the vagabond boys ears and the pleasantest he had ever heard he could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before the door was quickly unlocked and he entered huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves now my boy i hope you re good and hungry because breakfast will be ready as soon as the suns up and we ll have a piping hot one too make yourself easy about that i and the boys hoped youd turn up and stop here last night i was awful scared said huck and i run i took out when the pistols went off and i didnt stop for three mile i ve come now becuz i wanted to know about it you know and i come before daylight becuz i didnt want to run across them devils even if they was dead well poor chap you do look as if youd had a hard night of it but theres a bed here for you when you ve had your breakfast no they aint dead lad we are sorry enough for that you see we knew right where to put our hands on them by your description so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them dark as a cellar that sumach path was and just then i found i was going to sneeze it was the meanest kind of luck i tried to keep it back but no use twas bound to come and it did come i was in the lead with my pistol raised and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a rustling to get out of the path i sung out fire boys and blazed away at the place where the rustling was so did the boys but they were off in a jiffy those villains and we after them down through the woods i judge we never touched them they fired a shot apiece as they started but their bullets whizzed by and didnt do us any harm as soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing and went down and stirred up the constables they got a posse together and went off to guard the river bank and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods my boys will be with them presently i wish we had some sort of description of those rascals twould help a good deal but you couldnt see what they were like in the dark lad i suppose oh yes i saw them downtown and follered them splendid describe them describe them my boy ones the old deaf and dumb spaniard thats ben around here once or twice and t others a mean looking ragged thats enough lad we know the men happened on them in the woods back of the widows one day and they slunk away off with you boys and tell the sheriff get your breakfast tomorrow morning the welshmans sons departed at once as they were leaving the room huck sprang up and exclaimed oh please dont tell any body it was me that blowed on them oh please all right if you say it huck but you ought to have the credit of what you did oh no no please dont tell when the young men were gone the old welshman said they wont tell and i wont but why dont you want it known huck would not explain further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world he would be killed for knowing it sure the old man promised secrecy once more and said how did you come to follow these fellows lad were they looking suspicious huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply then he said well you see im a kind of a hard lot least everybody says so and i dont see nothing agin it and sometimes i cant sleep much on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing that was the way of it last night i couldnt sleep and so i come along upstreet bout midnight a turning it all over and when i got to that old shackly brick store by the temperance tavern i backed up agin the wall to have another think well just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me with something under their arm and i reckoned theyd stole it one was a smoking and t other one wanted a light so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and i see that the big one was the deaf and dumb spaniard by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye and t other one was a rusty ragged looking devil could you see the rags by the light of the cigars this staggered huck for a moment then he said well i dont know but somehow it seems as if i did then they went on and you follered em yes that was it i wanted to see what was up they sneaked along so i dogged em to the widders stile and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder and the spaniard swear hed spile her looks just as i told you and your two what the deaf and dumb man said all that huck had made another terrible mistake he was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the spaniard might be and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do he made several efforts to creep out of his scrape but the old mans eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder presently the welshman said my boy dont be afraid of me i wouldnt hurt a hair of your head for all the world no id protect you id protect you this spaniard is not deaf and dumb you ve let that slip without intending it you cant cover that up now you know something about that spaniard that you want to keep dark now trust me tell me what it is and trust me i wont betray you huck looked into the old mans honest eyes a moment then bent over and whispered in his ear taint a spaniard its injun joe the welshman almost jumped out of his chair in a moment he said its all plain enough now when you talked about notching ears and slitting noses i judged that that was your own embellishment because white men dont take that sort of revenge but an injun thats a different matter altogether during breakfast the talk went on and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done before going to bed was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood they found none but captured a bulky bundle of of what if the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning suddenness from hucks blanched lips his eyes were staring wide now and his breath suspended waiting for the answer the welshman started stared in return three seconds five seconds ten then replied of burglars tools why whats the matter with you huck sank back panting gently but deeply unutterably grateful the welshman eyed him gravely curiously and presently said yes burglars tools that appears to relieve you a good deal but what did give you that turn what were you expecting wed found huck was in a close place the inquiring eye was upon him he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer nothing suggested itself the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper a senseless reply offered there was no time to weigh it so at a venture he uttered it feebly sunday school books maybe poor huck was too distressed to smile but the old man laughed loud and joyously shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a mans pocket because it cut down the doctors bill like everything then he added poor old chap you re white and jaded you aint well a bit no wonder you re a little flighty and off your balance but you ll come out of it rest and sleep will fetch you out all right i hope huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure as soon as he had heard the talk at the widows stile he had only thought it was not the treasure however he had not known that it wasnt and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self possession but on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not the bundle and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable in fact everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction now the treasure must be still in no the men would be captured and jailed that day and he and tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door huck jumped for a hiding place for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late event the welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen among them the widow douglas and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill to stare at the stile so the news had spread the welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors the widows gratitude for her preservation was outspoken dont say a word about it madam theres another that you re more beholden to than you are to me and my boys maybe but he dont allow me to tell his name we wouldnt have been there but for him of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter but the welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors and through them be transmitted to the whole town for he refused to part with his secret when all else had been learned the widow said i went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise why didnt you come and wake me we judged it warnt worth while those fellows warnt likely to come again they hadnt any tools left to work with and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death my three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night they ve just come back more visitors came and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more there was no sabbath school during day school vacation but everybody was early at church the stirring event was well canvassed news came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered when the sermon was finished judge thatchers wife dropped alongside of mrs harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said is my becky going to sleep all day i just expected she would be tired to death your becky yes with a startled look didnt she stay with you last night why no mrs thatcher turned pale and sank into a pew just as aunt polly talking briskly with a friend passed by aunt polly said goodmorning mrs thatcher goodmorning mrs harper i ve got a boy thats turned up missing i reckon my tom stayed at your house last night one of you and now hes afraid to come to church i ve got to settle with him mrs thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever he didnt stay with us said mrs harper beginning to look uneasy a marked anxiety came into aunt pollys face joe harper have you seen my tom this morning nom when did you see him last joe tried to remember but was not sure he could say the people had stopped moving out of church whispers passed along and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance children were anxiously questioned and young teachers they all said they had not noticed whether tom and becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip it was dark no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing one young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave mrs thatcher swooned away aunt polly fell to crying and wringing her hands the alarm swept from lip to lip from group to group from street to street and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up the cardiff hill episode sank into instant insignificance the burglars were forgotten horses were saddled skiffs were manned the ferryboat ordered out and before the horror was half an hour old two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave all the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead many women visited aunt polly and mrs thatcher and tried to comfort them they cried with them too and that was still better than words all the tedious night the town waited for news but when the morning dawned at last all the word that came was send more candles and send food mrs thatcher was almost crazed and aunt polly also judge thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave but they conveyed no real cheer the old welshman came home toward daylight spattered with candle grease smeared with clay and almost worn out he found huck still in the bed that had been provided for him and delirious with fever the physicians were all at the cave so the widow douglas came and took charge of the patient she said she would do her best by him because whether he was good bad or indifferent he was the lords and nothing that was the lords was a thing to be neglected the welshman said huck had good spots in him and the widow said you can depend on it thats the lords mark he dont leave it off he never does puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village but the strongest of the citizens continued searching all the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance and shoutings and pistol shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles in one place far from the section usually traversed by tourists the names becky tom had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle smoke and near at hand a grease soiled bit of ribbon mrs thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it she said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came some said that now and then in the cave a far away speck of light would glimmer and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle and then a sickening disappointment always followed the children were not there it was only a searchers light three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along and the village sank into a hopeless stupor no one had heart for anything the accidental discovery just made that the proprietor of the temperance tavern kept liquor on his premises scarcely fluttered the public pulse tremendous as the fact was in a lucid interval huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns and finally asked dimly dreading the worst if anything had been discovered at the temperance tavern since he had been ill yes said the widow huck started up in bed wildeyed what what was it liquor and the place has been shut up lie down child what a turn you did give me only tell me just one thing only just one please was it tom sawyer that found it the widow burst into tears hush hush child hush i ve told you before you must not talk you are very very sick then nothing but liquor had been found there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold so the treasure was gone forever gone forever but what could she be crying about curious that she should cry these thoughts worked their dim way through hucks mind and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep the widow said to herself there hes asleep poor wreck tom sawyer find it pity but somebody could find tom sawyer ah there aint many left now thats got hope enough or strength enough either to go on searching chapter xxxi now to return to tom and beckys share in the picnic they tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company visiting the familiar wonders of the cave wonders dubbed with rather over descriptive names such as the drawing room the cathedral aladdins palace and so on presently the hide and seek frolicking began and tom and becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names dates postoffice addresses and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed in candle smoke still drifting along and talking they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed they smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on presently they came to a place where a little stream of water trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it had in the slow dragging ages formed a laced and ruffled niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for beckys gratification he found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him becky responded to his call and they made a smoke mark for future guidance and started upon their quest they wound this way and that far down into the secret depths of the cave made another mark and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about in one place they found a spacious cavern from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a mans leg they walked all about it wondering and admiring and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it this shortly brought them to a bewitching spring whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together the result of the ceaseless water drip of centuries under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together thousands in a bunch the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds squeaking and darting furiously at the candles tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct he seized beckys hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered and none too soon for a bat struck beckys light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern the bats chased the children a good distance but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered and at last got rid of the perilous things tom found a subterranean lake shortly which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows he wanted to explore its borders but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile first now for the first time the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children becky said why i didnt notice but it seems ever so long since i heard any of the others come to think becky we are away down below them and i dont know how far away north or south or east or whichever it is we couldnt hear them here becky grew apprehensive i wonder how long we ve been down here tom we better start back yes i reckon we betterp raps we better can you find the way tom its all a mixed up crookedness to me i reckon i could find it but then the bats if they put our candles out it will be an awful fix lets try some other way so as not to go through there well but i hope we wont get lost it would be so awful and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities they started through a corridor and traversed it in silence a long way glancing at each new opening to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it but they were all strange every time tom made an examination becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign and he would say cheerily oh its all right this aint the one but we ll come to it right away but he felt less and less hopeful with each failure and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted he still said it was all right but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said all is lost becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear and tried hard to keep back the tears but they would come at last she said oh tom never mind the bats lets go back that way we seem to get worse and worse off all the time listen said he profound silence silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush tom shouted the call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter oh dont do it again tom it is too horrid said becky it is horrid but i better becky they might hear us you know and he shouted again the might was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter it so confessed a perishing hope the children stood still and listened but there was no result tom turned upon the back track at once and hurried his steps it was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to becky he could not find his way back oh tom you didnt make any marks becky i was such a fool such a fool i never thought we might want to come back no i cant find the way its all mixed up tom tom we re lost we re lost we never can get out of this awful place oh why did we ever leave the others she sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that tom was appalled with the idea that she might die or lose her reason he sat down by her and put his arms around her she buried her face in his bosom she clung to him she poured out her terrors her unavailing regrets and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter tom begged her to pluck up hope again and she said she could not he fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation this had a better effect she said she would try to hope again she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more for he was no more to blame than she she said so they moved on again aimlessly simply at random all they could do was to move keep moving for a little while hope made a show of reviving not with any reason to back it but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure by and by tom took beckys candle and blew it out this economy meant so much words were not needed becky understood and her hope died again she knew that tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets yet he must economize by and by fatigue began to assert its claims the children tried to pay attention for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious moving in some direction in any direction was at least progress and might bear fruit but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit at last beckys frail limbs refused to carry her farther she sat down tom rested with her and they talked of home and the friends there and the comfortable beds and above all the light becky cried and tom tried to think of some way of comforting her but all his encouragements were grown thread bare with use and sounded like sarcasms fatigue bore so heavily upon becky that she drowsed off to sleep tom was grateful he sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams and by and by a smile dawned and rested there the peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories while he was deep in his musings becky woke up with a breezy little laugh but it was stricken dead upon her lips and a groan followed it oh how could i sleep i wish i never never had waked no no i dont tom dont look so i wont say it again im glad you ve slept becky you ll feel rested now and we ll find the way out we can try tom but i ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream i reckon we are going there maybe not maybe not cheer up becky and lets go on trying they rose up and wandered along hand in hand and hopeless they tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks and yet it was plain that this could not be for their candles were not gone yet a long time after this they could not tell how long tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water they must find a spring they found one presently and tom said it was time to rest again both were cruelly tired yet becky said she thought she could go a little farther she was surprised to hear tom dissent she could not understand it they sat down and tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay thought was soon busy nothing was said for some time then becky broke the silence tom i am so hungry tom took something out of his pocket do you remember this said he becky almost smiled its our wedding cake tom yes i wish it was as big as a barrel for its all we ve got i saved it from the picnic for us to dream on tom the way grownup people do with wedding cake but it ll be our she dropped the sentence where it was tom divided the cake and becky ate with good appetite while tom nibbled at his moiety there was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with by and by becky suggested that they move on again tom was silent a moment then he said becky can you bear it if i tell you something beckys face paled but she thought she could well then becky we must stay here where theres water to drink that little piece is our last candle becky gave loose to tears and wailings tom did what he could to comfort her but with little effect at length becky said tom well becky they ll miss us and hunt for us yes they will certainly they will maybe they re hunting for us now tom why i reckon maybe they are i hope they are when would they miss us tom when they get back to the boat i reckon tom it might be dark then would they notice we hadnt come i dont know but anyway your mother would miss you as soon as they got home a frightened look in beckys face brought tom to his senses and he saw that he had made a blunder becky was not to have gone home that night the children became silent and thoughtful in a moment a new burst of grief from becky showed tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also that the sabbath morning might be half spent before mrs thatcher discovered that becky was not at mrs harpers the children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last saw the feeble flame rise and fall climb the thin column of smoke linger at its top a moment and then the horror of utter darkness reigned how long afterward it was that becky came to a slow consciousness that she was crying in toms arms neither could tell all that they knew was that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more tom said it might be sunday now maybe monday he tried to get becky to talk but her sorrows were too oppressive all her hopes were gone tom said that they must have been missed long ago and no doubt the search was going on he would shout and maybe some one would come he tried it but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more the hours wasted away and hunger came to torment the captives again a portion of toms half of the cake was left they divided and ate it but they seemed hungrier than before the poor morsel of food only whetted desire by and by tom said sh did you hear that both held their breath and listened there was a sound like the faintest far off shout instantly tom answered it and leading becky by the hand started groping down the corridor in its direction presently he listened again again the sound was heard and apparently a little nearer its them said tom they re coming come along becky we re all right now the joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming their speed was slow however because pitfalls were somewhat common and had to be guarded against they shortly came to one and had to stop it might be three feet deep it might be a hundred there was no passing it at any rate tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could no bottom they must stay there and wait until the searchers came they listened evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant a moment or two more and they had gone altogether the heart sinking misery of it tom whooped until he was hoarse but it was of no use he talked hopefully to becky but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again the children groped their way back to the spring the weary time dragged on they slept again and awoke famished and woe stricken tom believed it must be tuesday by this time now an idea struck him there were some side passages near at hand it would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness he took a kite line from his pocket tied it to a projection and he and becky started tom in the lead unwinding the line as he groped along at the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a jumping off place tom got down on his knees and felt below and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right and at that moment not twenty yards away a human hand holding a candle appeared from behind a rock tom lifted up a glorious shout and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to injun joes tom was paralyzed he could not move he was vastly gratified the next moment to see the spaniard take to his heels and get himself out of sight tom wondered that joe had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court but the echoes must have disguised the voice without doubt that was it he reasoned toms fright weakened every muscle in his body he said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting injun joe again he was careful to keep from becky what it was he had seen he told her he had only shouted for luck but hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes the children awoke tortured with a raging hunger tom believed that it must be wednesday or thursday or even friday or saturday now and that the search had been given over he proposed to explore another passage he felt willing to risk injun joe and all other terrors but becky was very weak she had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused she said she would wait now where she was and die it would not be long she told tom to go with the kite line and explore if he chose but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her and she made him promise that when the awful time came he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over tom kissed her with a choking sensation in his throat and made a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave then he took the kite line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom chapter xxxii tuesday afternoon came and waned to the twilight the village of st petersburg still mourned the lost children had not been found public prayers had been offered up for them and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioners whole heart in it but still no good news came from the cave the majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations saying that it was plain the children could never be found mrs thatcher was very ill and a great part of the time delirious people said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time then lay it wearily down again with a moan aunt polly had drooped into a settled melancholy and her gray hair had grown almost white the village went to its rest on tuesday night sad and forlorn away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half clad people who shouted turn out turn out they re found they re found tin pans and horns were added to the din the population massed itself and moved toward the river met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens thronged around it joined its homeward march and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah the village was illuminated nobody went to bed again it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen during the first half hour a procession of villagers filed through judge thatchers house seized the saved ones and kissed them squeezed mrs thatchers hand tried to speak but couldnt and drifted out raining tears all over the place aunt pollys happiness was complete and mrs thatchers nearly so it would be complete however as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal and closed with a description of how he left becky and went on an exploring expedition how he followed two avenues as far as his kite line would reach how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite line and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far off speck that looked like daylight dropped the line and groped toward it pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole and saw the broad mississippi rolling by and if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more he told how he went back for becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff for she was tired and knew she was going to die and wanted to he described how he labored with her and convinced her and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out how they sat there and cried for gladness how some men came along in a skiff and tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition how the men didnt believe the wild tale at first because said they you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in then took them aboard rowed to a house gave them supper made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home before day dawn judge thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out in the cave by the twine clews they had strung behind them and informed of the great news three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off at once as tom and becky soon discovered they were bedridden all of wednesday and thursday and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn all the time tom got about a little on thursday was downtown friday and nearly as whole as ever saturday but becky did not leave her room until sunday and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness tom learned of hucks sickness and went to see him on friday but could not be admitted to the bedroom neither could he on saturday or sunday he was admitted daily after that but was warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic the widow douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed at home tom learned of the cardiff hill event also that the ragged mans body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry landing he had been drowned while trying to escape perhaps about a fortnight after toms rescue from the cave he started off to visit huck who had grown plenty strong enough now to hear exciting talk and tom had some that would interest him he thought judge thatchers house was on toms way and he stopped to see becky the judge and some friends set tom to talking and some one asked him ironically if he wouldnt like to go to the cave again tom said he thought he wouldnt mind it the judge said well there are others just like you tom i ve not the least doubt but we have taken care of that nobody will get lost in that cave any more why because i had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago and triple locked and i ve got the keys tom turned as white as a sheet whats the matter boy here run somebody fetch a glass of water the water was brought and thrown into toms face ah now you re all right what was the matter with you tom oh judge injun joes in the cave chapter xxxiii within a few minutes the news had spread and a dozen skiff loads of men were on their way to mcdougals cave and the ferryboat well filled with passengers soon followed tom sawyer was in the skiff that bore judge thatcher when the cave door was unlocked a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place injun joe lay stretched upon the ground dead with his face close to the crack of the door as if his longing eyes had been fixed to the latest moment upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside tom was touched for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered his pity was moved but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security now which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody minded outcast injun joes bowie knife lay close by its blade broken in two the great foundation beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through with tedious labor useless labor too it was for the native rock formed a sill outside it and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect the only damage done was to the knife itself but if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still for if the beam had been wholly cut away injun joe could not have squeezed his body under the door and he knew it so he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something in order to pass the weary time in order to employ his tortured faculties ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule left there by tourists but there were none now the prisoner had searched them out and eaten them he had also contrived to catch a few bats and these also he had eaten leaving only their claws the poor unfortunate had starved to death in one place near at hand a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages builded by the water drip from a stalactite overhead the captive had broken off the stalagmite and upon the stump had placed a stone wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock tick a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours that drop was falling when the pyramids were new when troy fell when the foundations of rome were laid when christ was crucified when the conqueror created the british empire when columbus sailed when the massacre at lexington was news it is falling now it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history and the twilight of tradition and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion has everything a purpose and a mission did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insects need and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come no matter it is many and many a year since the hapless half breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of mcdougals cave injun joes cup stands first in the list of the caverns marvels even aladdins palace cannot rival it injun joe was buried near the mouth of the cave and people flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around they brought their children and all sorts of provisions and confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the hanging this funeral stopped the further growth of one thing the petition to the governor for injun joes pardon the petition had been largely signed many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot injun joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the village but what of that if he had been satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon petition and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water works the morning after the funeral tom took huck to a private place to have an important talk huck had learned all about toms adventure from the welshman and the widow douglas by this time but tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him that thing was what he wanted to talk about now hucks face saddened he said i know what it is you got into no and never found anything but whiskey nobody told me it was you but i just knowed it must a ben you soon as i heard bout that whiskey business and i knowed you hadnt got the money becuz youd a got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else tom somethings always told me wed never get holt of that swag why huck i never told on that tavern keeper you know his tavern was all right the saturday i went to the picnic dont you remember you was to watch there that night oh yes why it seems bout a year ago it was that very night that i follered injun joe to the widders you followed him yes but you keep mum i reckon injun joes left friends behind him and i dont want em souring on me and doing me mean tricks if it hadnt ben for me hed be down in texas now all right then huck told his entire adventure in confidence to tom who had only heard of the welshmans part of it before well said huck presently coming back to the main question whoever nipped the whiskey in no nipped the money too i reckon anyways its a goner for us tom huck that money wasnt ever in no what huck searched his comrades face keenly tom have you got on the track of that money again huck its in the cave hucks eyes blazed say it again tom the moneys in the cave tom honest injun now is it fun or earnest earnest huck just as earnest as ever i was in my life will you go in there with me and help get it out i bet i will i will if its where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost huck we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world good as wheat what makes you think the moneys huck you just wait till we get in there if we dont find it i ll agree to give you my drum and every thing i ve got in the world i will by jings all right its a whiz when do you say right now if you say it are you strong enough is it far in the cave i ben on my pins a little three or four days now but i cant walk moren a mile tom least i dont think i could its about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go huck but theres a mighty short cut that they dont anybody but me know about huck i ll take you right to it in a skiff i ll float the skiff down there and i ll pull it back again all by myself you neednt ever turn your hand over less start right off tom all right we want some bread and meat and our pipes and a little bag or two and two or three kite strings and some of these new fangled things they call lucifer matches i tell you manys the time i wished i had some when i was in there before a trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was absent and got under way at once when they were several miles below cave hollow tom said now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollow no houses no wood yards bushes all alike but do you see that white place up yonder where theres been a landslide well thats one of my marks we ll get ashore now they landed now huck where we re a standing you could touch that hole i got out of with a fishing pole see if you can find it huck searched all the place about and found nothing tom proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said here you are look at it huck its the snuggest hole in this country you just keep mum about it all along i ve been wanting to be a robber but i knew id got to have a thing like this and where to run across it was the bother we ve got it now and we ll keep it quiet only we ll let joe harper and ben rogers in because of course theres got to be a gang or else there wouldnt be any style about it tom sawyers gang it sounds splendid dont it huck well it just does tom and who ll we rob oh most anybody waylay people thats mostly the way and kill them no not always hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom whats a ransom money you make them raise all they can offn their friends and after you ve kept them a year if it aint raised then you kill them thats the general way only you dont kill the women you shut up the women but you dont kill them they re always beautiful and rich and awfully scared you take their watches and things but you always take your hat off and talk polite they aint anybody as polite as robbers you ll see that in any book well the women get to loving you and after they ve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldnt get them to leave if you drove them out theyd turn right around and come back its so in all the books why its real bully tom i believe its bettern to be a pirate yes its better in some ways because its close to home and circuses and all that by this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole tom in the lead they toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel then made their spliced kite strings fast and moved on a few steps brought them to the spring and tom felt a shudder quiver all through him he showed huck the fragment of candle wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall and described how he and becky had watched the flame struggle and expire the boys began to quiet down to whispers now for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits they went on and presently entered and followed toms other corridor until they reached the jumping off place the candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high tom whispered now i ll show you something huck he held his candle aloft and said look as far around the corner as you can do you see that there on the big rock over yonder done with candle smoke tom its a cross now wheres your number two under the cross hey right yonders where i saw injun joe poke up his candle huck huck stared at the mystic sign awhile and then said with a shaky voice tom less git out of here what and leave the treasure yes leave it injun joes ghost is round about there certain no it aint huck no it aint it would ha nt the place where he died away out at the mouth of the cave five mile from here no tom it wouldnt it would hang round the money i know the ways of ghosts and so do you tom began to fear that huck was right mis givings gathered in his mind but presently an idea occurred to him lookyhere huck what fools we re making of ourselves injun joes ghost aint a going to come around where theres a cross the point was well taken it had its effect tom i didnt think of that but thats so its luck for us that cross is i reckon we ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box tom went first cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended huck followed four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in the boys examined three of them with no result they found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock with a pallet of blankets spread down in it also an old suspender some bacon rind and the well gnawed bones of two or three fowls but there was no moneybox the lads searched and researched this place but in vain tom said he said under the cross well this comes nearest to being under the cross it cant be under the rock itself because that sets solid on the ground they searched everywhere once more and then sat down discouraged huck could suggest nothing by and by tom said lookyhere huck theres footprints and some candle grease on the clay about one side of this rock but not on the other sides now whats that for i bet you the money is under the rock im going to dig in the clay that aint no bad notion tom said huck with animation toms real barlow was out at once and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood hey huck you hear that huck began to dig and scratch now some boards were soon uncovered and removed they had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could but said he could not see to the end of the rift he proposed to explore he stooped and passed under the narrow way descended gradually he followed its winding course first to the right then to the left huck at his heels tom turned a short curve by and by and exclaimed my goodness huck lookyhere it was the treasure box sure enough occupying a snug little cavern along with an empty powder keg a couple of guns in leather cases two or three pairs of old moccasins a leather belt and some other rubbish well soaked with the water drip got it at last said huck ploughing among the tarnished coins with his hand my but we re rich tom huck i always reckoned wed get it its just too good to believe but we have got it sure say lets not fool around here lets snake it out lemme see if i can lift the box it weighed about fifty pounds tom could lift it after an awkward fashion but could not carry it conveniently i thought so he said they carried it like it was heavy that day at the ha nted house i noticed that i reckon i was right to think of fetching the little bags along the money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock now less fetch the guns and things said huck no huck leave them there they re just the tricks to have when we go to robbing we ll keep them there all the time and we ll hold our orgies there too its an awful snug place for orgies what orgies i dono but robbers always have orgies and of course we ve got to have them too come along huck we ve been in here a long time its getting late i reckon im hungry too we ll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff they presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes looked warily out found the coast clear and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff as the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight chatting cheerily with huck and landed shortly after dark now huck said tom we ll hide the money in the loft of the widows woodshed and i ll come up in the morning and we ll count it and divide and then we ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till i run and hook benny taylors little wagon i wont be gone a minute he disappeared and presently returned with the wagon put the two small sacks into it threw some old rags on top of them and started off dragging his cargo behind him when the boys reached the welshmans house they stopped to rest just as they were about to move on the welshman stepped out and said hallo whos that huck and tom sawyer good come along with me boys you are keeping everybody waiting here hurry up trot ahead i ll haul the wagon for you why its not as light as it might be got bricks in it or old metal old metal said tom i judged so the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work but thats human nature hurry along hurry along the boys wanted to know what the hurry was about never mind you ll see when we get to the widow douglas huck said with some apprehension for he was long used to being falsely accused mr jones we havent been doing nothing the welshman laughed well i dont know huck my boy i dont know about that aint you and the widow good friends yes well shes ben good friends to me anyway all right then what do you want to be afraid for this question was not entirely answered in hucks slow mind before he found himself pushed along with tom into mrs douglas drawing room mr jones left the wagon near the door and followed the place was grandly lighted and everybody that was of any consequence in the village was there the thatchers were there the harpers the rogerses aunt polly sid mary the minister the editor and a great many more and all dressed in their best the widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings they were covered with clay and candle grease aunt polly blushed crimson with humiliation and frowned and shook her head at tom nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did however mr jones said tom wasnt at home yet so i gave him up but i stumbled on him and huck right at my door and so i just brought them along in a hurry and you did just right said the widow come with me boys she took them to a bedchamber and said now wash and dress yourselves here are two new suits of clothes shirts socks everything complete they re hucks no no thanks huck mr jones bought one and i the other but they ll fit both of you get into them we ll wait come down when you are slicked up enough then she left chapter xxxiv huck said tom we can slope if we can find a rope the window aint high from the ground shucks what do you want to slope for well i aint used to that kind of a crowd i cant stand it i aint going down there tom oh bother it aint anything i dont mind it a bit i ll take care of you sid appeared tom said he auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon mary got your sunday clothes ready and everybodys been fretting about you say aint this grease and clay on your clothes now mr siddy you jist tend to your own business whats all this blowout about anyway its one of the widows parties that shes always having this time its for the welshman and his sons on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night and say i can tell you something if you want to know well what why old mr jones is going to try to spring something on the people here tonight but i overheard him tell auntie today about it as a secret but i reckon its not much of a secret now everybody knows the widow too for all she tries to let on she dont mr jones was bound huck should be here couldnt get along with his grand secret without huck you know secret about what sid about huck tracking the robbers to the widows i reckon mr jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise but i bet you it will drop pretty flat sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way sid was it you that told oh never mind who it was somebody told thats enough sid theres only one person in this town mean enough to do that and thats you if you had been in hucks place youd a sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers you cant do any but mean things and you cant bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones there no thanks as the widow says and tom cuffed sids ears and helped him to the door with several kicks now go and tell auntie if you dare and tomorrow you ll catch it some minutes later the widows guests were at the supper table and a dozen children were propped up at little side tables in the same room after the fashion of that country and that day at the proper time mr jones made his little speech in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons but said that there was another person whose modesty and so forth and so on he sprung his secret about hucks share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances however the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude upon huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybodys gaze and everybodys laudations the widow said she meant to give huck a home under her roof and have him educated and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way toms chance was come he said huck dont need it hucks rich nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke but the silence was a little awkward tom broke it hucks got money maybe you dont believe it but hes got lots of it oh you neednt smile i reckon i can show you you just wait a minute tom ran out of doors the company looked at each other with a perplexed interest and inquiringly at huck who was tongue tied sid what ails tom said aunt polly he well there aint ever any making of that boy out i never tom entered struggling with the weight of his sacks and aunt polly did not finish her sentence tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said there what did i tell you half of its hucks and half of its mine the spectacle took the general breath away all gazed nobody spoke for a moment then there was a unanimous call for an explanation tom said he could furnish it and he did the tale was long but brimful of interest there was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the charm of its flow when he had finished mr jones said i thought i had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion but it dont amount to anything now this one makes it sing mighty small im willing to allow the money was counted the sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand dollars it was more than any one present had ever seen at one time before though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that in property chapter xxxv the reader may rest satisfied that toms and hucks windfall made a mighty stir in the poor little village of st petersburg so vast a sum all in actual cash seemed next to incredible it was talked about gloated over glorified until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement every haunted house in st petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected plank by plank and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasure and not by boys but men pretty grave unromantic men too some of them wherever tom and huck appeared they were courted admired stared at the boys were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before but now their sayings were treasured and repeated everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things moreover their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality the village paper published biographical sketches of the boys the widow douglas put hucks money out at six per cent and judge thatcher did the same with toms at aunt pollys request each lad had an income now that was simply prodigious a dollar for every weekday in the year and half of the sundays it was just what the minister got no it was what he was promised he generally couldnt collect it a dollar and a quarter a week would board lodge and school a boy in those old simple days and clothe him and wash him too for that matter judge thatcher had conceived a great opinion of tom he said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave when becky told her father in strict confidence how tom had taken her whipping at school the judge was visibly moved and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own the judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble a generous a magnanimous lie a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast with george washingtons lauded truth about the hatchet becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that she went straight off and told tom about it judge thatcher hoped to see tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day he said he meant to look to it that tom should be admitted to the national military academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country in order that he might be ready for either career or both huck finns wealth and the fact that he was now under the widow douglas protection introduced him into society no dragged him into it hurled him into it and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear the widows servants kept him clean and neat combed and brushed and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend he had to eat with a knife and fork he had to use napkin cup and plate he had to learn his book he had to go to church he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth whithersoever he turned the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot he bravely bore his miseries three weeks and then one day turned up missing for forty eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress the public were profoundly concerned they searched high and low they dragged the river for his body early the third morning tom sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter house and in one of them he found the refugee huck had slept there he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food and was lying off now in comfort with his pipe he was unkempt uncombed and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy tom routed him out told him the trouble he had been causing and urged him to go home hucks face lost its tranquil content and took a melancholy cast he said dont talk about it tom i ve tried it and it dont work it dont work tom it aint for me i aint used to it the widders good to me and friendly but i cant stand them ways she makes me get up just at the same time every morning she makes me wash they comb me all to thunder she wont let me sleep in the woodshed i got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me tom they dont seem to

comfort id got to go up in the attic and rip out awhile every day to git a taste in my mouth or id a died tom the widder wouldnt let me smoke she wouldnt let me yell she wouldnt let me gape nor

widder oh huck you know i cant do that taint fair and besides if you ll try this thing just a while longer you ll come to like it like it yes the way id like a hot stove if i was to set on it long enough no tom i wont be rich and i wont live in them cussed smothery houses i like the woods and the river and hogsheads and i ll stick to em too blame it all just as wed got guns and a cave and all just fixed to rob here this dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all tom saw his opportunity lookyhere huck being rich aint going to keep me back from turning robber no oh good licks are you in real dead wood earnest tom just as dead earnest as im sitting here but huck we cant let you into the gang if you aint respectable you know hucks joy was quenched cant let me in tom didnt you let me go for a pirate yes but thats different a robber is more high toned than what a pirate is as a general thing in most countries they re awful high up in the nobility dukes and such now tom haint you always ben friendly to me you wouldnt shet me out would you tom you wouldnt do that now would you tom huck i wouldnt want to and i dont want to but what would people say why theyd say mph tom sawyers gang pretty low characters in it theyd mean you huck you wouldnt like that and i wouldnt huck was silent for some time engaged in a mental struggle finally he said well i ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if i can come to stand it if you ll let me b long to the gang tom all right huck its a whiz come along old chap and i ll ask the widow to let up on you a

coffin and sign it with blood now thats something like why its a million times bullier than pirating i ll stick to the widder till i rot tom and if i git to be a reg lar ripper of a robber and everybody talking bout it i reckon she ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet conclusion so endeth this chronicle it being strictly a history of a boy it must stop here the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a man when one writes a novel about grown people he knows exactly where to stop that is with a marriage but when he writes of juveniles he must stop where he best can most of the characters that perform in this book still live and are prosperous and happy some day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present a tramp abroad part chapter i the knighted knave of bergen one day it occurred to me that it had been many years since the world had been afforded the spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake a journey through europe on foot after much thought i decided that i was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle so i determined to do it this was in march i looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the capacity of agent and finally hired a mr harris for this service it was also my purpose to study art while in europe mr harris was in sympathy with me in this he was as much of an enthusiast in art as i was and not less anxious to learn to paint i desired to learn the german language so did harris toward the middle of april we sailed in the holsatia captain brandt and had a very pleasant trip indeed after a brief rest at hamburg we made preparations for a long pedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather but at the last moment we changed the program for private reasons and took the express train we made a short halt at frankfort on the main and found it an interesting city i would have liked to visit the birthplace of gutenburg but it could not be done as no memorandum of the site of the house has been kept so we spent an hour in the goethe mansion instead the city permits this house to belong to private parties instead of gracing and dignifying herself with the honor of possessing and protecting it frankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of being the place where the following incident occurred charlemagne while chasing the saxons as he said or being chased by them as they said arrived at the bank of the river at dawn in a fog the enemy were either before him or behind him but in any case he wanted to get across very badly he would have given anything for a guide but none was to be had presently he saw a deer followed by her young approach the water he watched her judging that she would seek a ford and he was right she waded over and the army followed so a great frankish victory or defeat was gained or avoided and in order to commemorate the episode charlemagne commanded a city to be built there which he named frankfort the ford of the franks none of the other cities where this event happened were named for it this is good evidence that frankfort was the first place it occurred at frankfort has another distinction it is the birthplace of the german alphabet or at least of the german word for alphabet buchstaben they say that the first movable types were made on birch sticks buchstabe hence the name i was taught a lesson in political economy in frankfort i had brought from home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars by way of experiment i stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street took four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars and laid down a silver piece worth cents the man gave me cents change in frankfort everybody wears clean clothes and i think we noticed that this strange thing was the case in hamburg too and in the villages along the road even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient quarters of frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule the little children of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a bodys lap and as for the uniforms of the soldiers they were newness and brightness carried to perfection one could never detect a smirch or a grain of dust upon them the street car conductors and drivers wore pretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the bandbox and their manners were as fine as their clothes in one of the shops i had the luck to stumble upon a book which has charmed me nearly to death it is entitled the legends of the rhine from basle to rotterdam by fj kiefer translated by lw garnhamb a all tourists mention the rhine legends in that sort of way which quietly pretends that the mentioner has been familiar with them all his life and that the reader cannot possibly be ignorant of them but no tourist ever tells them so this little book fed me in a very hungry place and i in my turn intend to feed my reader with one or two little lunches from the same larder i shall not mar garnhams translation by meddling with its english for the most toothsome thing about it is its quaint fashion of building english sentences on the german plan and punctuating them accordingly to no plan at all in the chapter devoted to legends of frankfort i find the following the knave of bergen in frankfort at the romer was a great mask ball at the coronation festival and in the illuminated saloon the clanging music invited to dance and splendidly appeared the rich toilets and charms of the ladies and the festively costumed princes and knights all seemed pleasure joy and roguish gaiety only one of the numerous guests had a gloomy exterior but exactly the black armor in which he walked about excited general attention and his tall figure as well as the noble propriety of his movements attracted especially the regards of the ladies who the knight was nobody could guess for his vizier was well closed and nothing made him recognizable proud and yet modest he advanced to the empress bowed on one knee before her seat and begged for the favor of a waltz with the queen of the festival and she allowed his request with light and graceful steps he danced through the long saloon with the sovereign who thought never to have found a more dexterous and excellent dancer but also by the grace of his manner and fine conversation he knew to win the queen and she graciously accorded him a second dance for which he begged a third and a fourth as well as others were not refused him how all regarded the happy dancer how many envied him the high favor how increased curiosity who the masked knight could be also the emperor became more and more excited with curiosity and with great suspense one awaited the hour when according to mask law each masked guest must make himself known this moment came but although all other unmasked the secret knight still refused to allow his features to be seen till at last the queen driven by curiosity and vexed at the obstinate refusal commanded him to open his vizier he opened it and none of the high ladies and knights knew him but from the crowded spectators officials advanced who recognized the black dancer and horror and terror spread in the saloon as they said who the supposed knight was it was the executioner of bergen but glowing with rage the king commanded to seize the criminal and lead him to death who had ventured to dance with the queen so disgraced the empress and insulted the crown the culpable threw himself at the emperor and said indeed i have heavily sinned against all noble guests assembled here but most heavily against you my sovereign and my queen the queen is insulted by my haughtiness equal to treason but no punishment even blood will not be able to wash out the disgrace which you have suffered by me therefore oh king allow me to propose a remedy to efface the shame and to render it as if not done draw your sword and knight me then i will throw down my gauntlet to everyone who dares to speak disrespectfully of my king the emperor was surprised at this bold proposal however it appeared the wisest to him you are a knave he replied after a moments consideration however your advice is good and displays prudence as your offense shows adventurous courage well then and gave him the knight stroke so i raise you to nobility who begged for grace for your offense now kneels before me rise as knight knavish you have acted and knave of bergen shall you be called henceforth and gladly the black knight rose three cheers were given in honor of the emperor and loud cries of joy testified the approbation with which the queen danced still once with the knave of bergen chapter ii heidelberg landing a monarch at heidelberg we stopped at a hotel by the railway station next morning as we sat in my room waiting for breakfast to come up we got a good deal interested in something which was going on over the way in front of another hotel first the personage who is called the portier who is not the porter but is a sort of first mate of a hotel see appendix a appeared at the door in a spick and span new blue cloth uniform decorated with shining brass buttons and with bands of gold lace around his cap and wristbands and he wore white gloves too he shed an official glance upon the situation and then began to give orders two women servants came out with pails and brooms and brushes and gave the sidewalk a thorough scrubbing meanwhile two others scrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door beyond these we could see some men servants taking up the carpet of the grand staircase this carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and banged and swept out of it then brought back and put down again the brass stair rods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to their places now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming plants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the base of the staircase other servants adorned all the balconies of the various stories with flowers and banners others ascended to the roof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there now came some more chamber maids and retouched the sidewalk and afterward wiped the marble steps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather brushes now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the marble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone the portier cast his eye along it and found it was not absolutely straight he commanded it to be straightened the servants made the effort made several efforts in fact but the portier was not satisfied he finally had it taken up and then he put it down himself and got it right at this stage of the proceedings a narrow bright red carpet was unrolled and stretched from the top of the marble steps to the curbstone along the center of the black carpet this red path cost the portier more trouble than even the black one had done but he patiently fixed and refixed it until it was exactly right and lay precisely in the middle of the black carpet in new york these performances would have gathered a mighty crowd of curious and intensely interested spectators but here it only captured an audience of half a dozen little boys who stood in a row across the pavement some with their school knapsacks on their backs and their hands in their pockets others with arms full of bundles and all absorbed in the show occasionally one of them skipped irreverently over the carpet and took up a position on the other side this always visibly annoyed the portier now came a waiting interval the landlord in plain clothes and bareheaded placed himself on the bottom marble step abreast the portier who stood on the other end of the same steps six or eight waiters gloved bareheaded and wearing their whitest linen their whitest cravats and their finest swallow tails grouped themselves about these chiefs but leaving the carpetway clear nobody moved or spoke any more but only waited in a short time the shrill piping of a coming train was heard and immediately groups of people began to gather in the street two or three open carriages arrived and deposited some maids of honor and some male officials at the hotel presently another open carriage brought the grand duke of baden a stately man in uniform who wore the handsome brass mounted steel spiked helmet of the army on his head last came the empress of germany and the grand duchess of baden in a closed carriage these passed through the low bowing groups of servants and disappeared in the hotel exhibiting to us only the backs of their heads and then the show was over it appears to be as difficult to land a monarch as it is to launch a ship but as to heidelberg the weather was growing pretty warm very warm in fact so we left the valley and took quarters at the schloss hotel on the hill above the castle heidelberg lies at the mouth of a narrow gorge a gorge the shape of a shepherds crook if one looks up it he perceives that it is about straight for a mile and a half then makes a sharp curve to the right and disappears this gorge along whose bottom pours the swift neckar is confined between or cloven through a couple of long steep ridges a thousand feet high and densely wooded clear to their summits with the exception of one section which has been shaved and put under cultivation these ridges are chopped off at the mouth of the gorge and form two bold and conspicuous headlands with heidelberg nestling between them from their bases spreads away the vast dim expanse of the rhine valley and into this expanse the neckar goes wandering in shining curves and is presently lost to view now if one turns and looks up the gorge once more he will see the schloss hotel on the right perched on a precipice overlooking the neckar a precipice which is so sumptuously cushioned and draped with foliage that no glimpse of the rock appears the building seems very airily situated it has the appearance of being on a shelf half way up the wooded mountainside and as it is remote and isolated and very white it makes a strong mark against the lofty leafy rampart at its back this hotel had a feature which was a decided novelty and one which might be adopted with advantage by any house which is perched in a commanding situation this feature may be described as a series of glass enclosed parlors clinging to the outside of the house one against each and every bed chamber and drawing room they are like long narrow high ceiled bird cages hung against the building my room was a corner room and had two of these things a north one and a west one from the north cage one looks up the neckar gorge from the west one he looks down it this last affords the most extensive view and it is one of the loveliest that can be imagined too out of a billowy upheaval of vivid green foliage a rifle shot removed rises the huge ruin of heidelberg castle see appendix b with empty window arches ivy mailed battlements moldering towers the lear of inanimate nature deserted discrowned beaten by the storms but royal still and beautiful it is a fine sight to see the evening sunlight suddenly strike the leafy declivity at the castles base and dash up it and drench it as with a luminous spray while the adjacent groves are in deep shadow behind the castle swells a great dome shaped hill forest clad and beyond that a nobler and loftier one the castle looks down upon the compact brown roofed town and from the town two picturesque old bridges span the river now the view broadens through the gateway of the sentinel headlands you gaze out over the wide rhine plain which stretches away softly and richly tinted grows gradually and dreamily indistinct and finally melts imperceptibly into the remote horizon i have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm about it as this one gives the first night we were there we went to bed and to sleep early but i awoke at the end of two or three hours and lay a comfortable while listening to the soothing patter of the rain against the balcony windows i took it to be rain but it turned out to be only the murmur of the restless neckar tumbling over her dikes and dams far below in the gorge i got up and went into the west balcony and saw a wonderful sight away down on the level under the black mass of the castle the town lay stretched along the river its intricate cobweb of streets jeweled with twinkling lights there were rows of lights on the bridges these flung lances of light upon the water in the black shadows of the arches and away at the extremity of all this fairy spectacle blinked and glowed a massed multitude of gas jets which seemed to cover acres of ground it was as if all the diamonds in the world had been spread out there i did not know before that a half mile of sextuple railway tracks could be made such an adornment one thinks heidelberg by day with its surroundings is the last possibility of the beautiful but when he sees heidelberg by night a fallen milky way with that glittering railway constellation pinned to the border he requires time to consider upon the verdict one never tires of poking about in the dense woods that clothe all these lofty neckar hills to their tops the great deeps of a boundless forest have a beguiling and impressive charm in any country but german legends and fairy tales have given these an added charm they have peopled all that region with gnomes and dwarfs and all sorts of mysterious and uncanny creatures at the time i am writing of i had been reading so much of this literature that sometimes i was not sure but i was beginning to believe in the gnomes and fairies as realities one afternoon i got lost in the woods about a mile from the hotel and presently fell into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk and kobolds and enchanted folk and the rest of the pleasant legendary stuff and so by stimulating my fancy i finally got to imagining i glimpsed small flitting shapes here and there down the columned aisles of the forest it was a place which was peculiarly meet for the occasion it was a pine wood with so thick and soft a carpet of brown needles that ones footfall made no more sound than if he were treading on wool the tree trunks were as round and straight and smooth as pillars and stood close together they were bare of branches to a point about twenty five feet above ground and from there upward so thick with boughs that not a ray of sunlight could pierce through the world was bright with sunshine outside but a deep and mellow twilight reigned in there and also a deep silence so profound that i seemed to hear my own breathings when i had stood ten minutes thinking and imagining and getting my spirit in tune with the place and in the right mood to enjoy the supernatural a raven suddenly uttered a horse croak over my head it made me start and then i was angry because i started i looked up and the creature was sitting on a limb right over me looking down at me i felt something of the same sense of humiliation and injury which one feels when he finds that a human stranger has been clandestinely inspecting him in his privacy and mentally commenting upon him i eyed the raven and the raven eyed me nothing was said during some seconds then the bird stepped a little way along his limb to get a better point of observation lifted his wings stuck his head far down below his shoulders toward me and croaked again a croak with a distinctly insulting expression about it if he had spoken in english he could not have said any more plainly than he did say in raven well what do you want here i felt as foolish as if i had been caught in some mean act by a responsible being and reproved for it however i made no reply i would not bandy words with a raven the adversary waited a while with his shoulders still lifted his head thrust down between them and his keen bright eye fixed on me then he threw out two or three more insults which i could not understand further than that i knew a portion of them consisted of language not used in church i still made no reply now the adversary raised his head and called there was an answering croak from a little distance in the wood evidently a croak of inquiry the adversary explained with enthusiasm and the other raven dropped everything and came the two sat side by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and offensively as two great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug the thing became more and more embarrassing they called in another friend this was too much i saw that they had the advantage of me and so i concluded to get out of the scrape by walking out of it they enjoyed my defeat as much as any low white people could have done they craned their necks and laughed at me for a raven can laugh just like a man they squalled insulting remarks after me as long as they could see me they were nothing but ravens i knew that what they thought of me could be a matter of no consequence and yet when even a raven shouts after you what a hat oh pull down your vest and that sort of thing it hurts you and humiliates you and there is no getting around it with fine reasoning and pretty arguments animals talk to each other of course there can be no question about that but i suppose there are very few people who can understand them i never knew but one man who could i knew he could however because he told me so himself he was a middle aged simple hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner of california among the woods and mountains a good many years and had studied the ways of his only neighbors the beasts and the birds until he believed he could accurately translate any remark which they made this was jim baker according to jim baker some animals have only a limited education and some use only simple words and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure whereas certain other animals have a large vocabulary a fine command of language and a ready and fluent delivery consequently these latter talk a great deal they like it they are so conscious of their talent and they enjoy showing off baker said that after long and careful observation he had come to the conclusion that the bluejays were the best talkers he had found among birds and beasts said he theres more to a bluejay than any other creature he has got more moods and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures and mind you whatever a bluejay feels he can put into language and no mere commonplace language either but rattling out and out book talk and bristling with metaphor too just bristling and as for command of language why you never see a bluejay get stuck for a word no man ever did they just boil out of him and another thing i ve noticed a good deal and theres no bird or cow or anything that uses as good grammar as a bluejay you may say a cat uses good grammar well a cat does but you let a cat get excited once you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed nights and you ll hear grammar that will give you the lockjaw ignorant people think its the noise which fighting cats make that is so aggravating but it aint so its the sickening grammar they use now i ve never heard a jay use bad grammar but very seldom and when they do they are as ashamed as a human they shut right down and leave you may call a jay a bird well so he is in a measure but hes got feathers on him and dont belong to no church perhaps but otherwise he is just as much human as you be and i ll tell you for why a jays gifts and instincts and feelings and interests cover the whole ground a jay hasnt got any more principle than a congressman a jay will lie a jay will steal a jay will deceive a jay will betray and four times out of five a jay will go back on his solemnest promise the sacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you cant cram into no bluejays head now on top of all this theres another thing a jay can out swear any gentleman in the mines you think a cat can swear well a cat can but you give a bluejay a subject that calls for his reserve powers and where is your cat dont talk to me i know too much about this thing in the one little particular of scolding just good clean out and out scolding a bluejay can lay over anything human or divine yes sir a jay is everything that a man is a jay can cry a jay can laugh a jay can feel shame a jay can reason and plan and discuss a jay likes gossip and scandal a jay has got a sense of humor a jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do maybe better if a jay aint human he better take in his sign thats all now im going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some bluejays chapter iii bakers bluejay yarn what stumped the blue jays when i first begun to understand jay language correctly there was a little incident happened here seven years ago the last man in this region but me moved away there stands his house been empty ever since a log house with a plank roof just one big room and no more no ceiling nothing between the rafters and the floor well one sunday morning i was sitting out here in front of my cabin with my cat taking the sun and looking at the blue hills and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees and thinking of the home away yonder in the states that i hadnt heard from in thirteen years when a bluejay lit on that house with an acorn in his mouth and says hello i reckon i ve struck something when he spoke the acorn dropped out of his mouth and rolled down the roof of course but he didnt care his mind was all on the thing he had struck it was a knot hole in the roof he cocked his head to one side shut one eye and put the other one to the hole like a possum looking down a jug then he glanced up with his bright eyes gave a wink or two with his wings which signifies gratification you understand and says it looks like a hole its located like a hole blamed if i dont believe it is a hole then he cocked his head down and took another look he glances up perfectly joyful this time winks his wings and his tail both and says oh no this aint no fat thing i reckon if i aint in luck why its a perfectly elegant hole so he flew down and got that acorn and fetched it up and dropped it in and was just tilting his head back with the heavenliest smile on his face when all of a sudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath offn a razor and the queerest look of surprise took its place then he says why i didnt hear it fall he cocked his eye at the hole again and took a long look raised up and shook his head stepped around to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side shook his head again he studied a while then he just went into the details walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass no use now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute and finally says well its too many for me thats certain must be a mighty long hole however i aint got no time to fool around here i got to tend to business i reckon its all right chance it anyway so he flew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in and tried to flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it but he was too late he held his eye there as much as a minute then he raised up and sighed and says confound it i dont seem to understand this thing no way however i ll tackle her again he fetched another acorn and done his level best to see what become of it but he couldnt he says well i never struck no such a hole as this before im of the opinion its a totally new kind of a hole then he begun to get mad he held in for a spell walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself but his feelings got the upper hand of him presently and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face i never see a bird take on so about a little thing when he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a minute then he says well you re a long hole and a deep hole and a mighty singular hole altogether but i ve started in to fill you and im damned if i dont fill you if it takes a hundred years and with that away he went you never see a bird work so since you was born he laid into his work like a nigger and the way he hove acorns into that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most exciting and astonishing spectacles i ever struck he never stopped to take a look anymore he just hove em in and went for more well at last he could hardly flop his wings he was so tuckered out he comes a dropping down once more sweating like an ice pitcher dropped his acorn in and says now i guess i ve got the bulge on you by this time so he bent down for a look if you ll believe me when his head come up again he was just pale with rage he says i ve shoveled acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years and if i can see a sign of one of em i wish i may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes he just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and lean his back agin the chimbly and then he collected his impressions and begun to free his mind i see in a second that what i had mistook for profanity in the mines was only just the rudiments as you may say another jay was going by and heard him doing his devotions and stops to inquire what was up the sufferer told him the whole circumstance and says now yonders the hole and if you dont believe me go and look for yourself so this fellow went and looked and comes back and says how many did you say you put in there not any less than two tons says the sufferer the other jay went and looked again he couldnt seem to make it out so he raised a yell and three more jays come they all examined the hole they all made the sufferer tell it over again then they all discussed it and got off as many leather headed opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could have done they called in more jays then more and more till pretty soon this whole region peared to have a blue flush about it there must have been five thousand of them and such another jawing and disputing and ripping and cussing you never heard every jay in the whole lot put his eye to the hole and delivered a more chuckle headed opinion about the mystery than the jay that went there before him they examined the house all over too the door was standing half open and at last one old jay happened to go and light on it and look in of course that knocked the mystery galley west in a second there lay the acorns scattered all over the floor he flopped his wings and raised a whoop come here he says come here everybody hangd if this fool hasnt been trying to fill up a house with acorns they all came a swooping down like a blue cloud and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance the whole absurdity of the contract that that first jay had tackled hit him home and he fell over backward suffocating with laughter and the next jay took his place and done the same well sir they roosted around here on the housetop and the trees for an hour and guffawed over that thing like human beings it aint any use to tell me a bluejay hasnt got a sense of humor because i know better and memory too they brought jays here from all over the united states to look down that hole every summer for three years other birds too and they could all see the point except an owl that come from nova scotia to visit the yo semite and he took this thing in on his way back he said he couldnt see anything funny in it but then he was a good deal disappointed about yo semite too chapter iv student life the laborious beer king the summer semester was in full tide consequently the most frequent figure in and about heidelberg was the student most of the students were germans of course but the representatives of foreign lands were very numerous they hailed from every corner of the globe for instruction is cheap in heidelberg and so is living too the anglo american club composed of british and american students had twenty five members and there was still much material left to draw from nine tenths of the heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform the other tenth wore caps of various colors and belonged to social organizations called corps there were five corps each with a color of its own there were white caps blue caps and red yellow and green ones the famous duel fighting is confined to the corps boys the kneip seems to be a specialty of theirs too kneips are held now and then to celebrate great occasions like the election of a beer king for instance the solemnity is simple the five corps assemble at night and at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer out of pint mugs as fast as possible and each man keeps his own count usually by laying aside a lucifer match for each mug he empties the election is soon decided when the candidates can hold no more a count is instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of pints is proclaimed king i was told that the last beer king elected by the corps or by his own capabilities emptied his mug seventy five times no stomach could hold all that quantity at one time of course but there are ways of frequently creating a vacuum which those who have been much at sea will understand one sees so many students abroad at all hours that he presently begins to wonder if they ever have any working hours some of them have some of them havent each can choose for himself whether he will work or play for german university life is a very free life it seems to have no restraints the student does not live in the college buildings but hires his own lodgings in any locality he prefers and he takes his meals when and where he pleases he goes to bed when it suits him and does not get up at all unless he wants to he is not entered at the university for any particular length of time so he is likely to change about he passes no examinations upon entering college he merely pays a trifling fee of five or ten dollars receives a card entitling him to the privileges of the university and that is the end of it he is now ready for business or play as he shall prefer if he elects to work he finds a large list of lectures to choose from he selects the subjects which he will study and enters his name for these studies but he can skip attendance the result of this system is that lecture courses upon specialties of an unusual nature are often delivered to very slim audiences while those upon more practical and every day matters of education are delivered to very large ones i heard of one case where day after day the lecturers audience consisted of three students and always the same three but one day two of them remained away the lecturer began as usual gentlemen then without a smile he corrected himself saying sir and went on with his discourse it is said that the vast majority of the heidelberg students are hard workers and make the most of their opportunities that they have no surplus means to spend in dissipation and no time to spare for frolicking one lecture follows right on the heels of another with very little time for the student to get out of one hall and into the next but the industrious ones manage it by going on a trot the professors assist them in the saving of their time by being promptly in their little boxed up pulpits when the hours strike and as promptly out again when the hour finishes i entered an empty lecture room one day just before the clock struck the place had simple unpainted pine desks and benches for about two hundred persons about a minute before the clock struck a hundred and fifty students swarmed in rushed to their seats immediately spread open their notebooks and dipped their pens in ink when the clock began to strike a burly professor entered was received with a round of applause moved swiftly down the center aisle said gentlemen and began to talk as he climbed his pulpit steps and by the time he had arrived in his box and faced his audience his lecture was well under way and all the pens were going he had no notes he talked with prodigious rapidity and energy for an hour then the students began to remind him in certain well understood ways that his time was up he seized his hat still talking proceeded swiftly down his pulpit steps got out the last word of his discourse as he struck the floor everybody rose respectfully and he swept rapidly down the aisle and disappeared an instant rush for some other lecture room followed and in a minute i was alone with the empty benches once more yes without doubt idle students are not the rule out of eight hundred in the town i knew the faces of only about fifty but these i saw everywhere and daily they walked about the streets and the wooded hills they drove in cabs they boated on the river they sipped beer and coffee afternoons in the schloss gardens a good many of them wore colored caps of the corps they were finely and fashionably dressed their manners were quite superb and they led an easy careless comfortable life if a dozen of them sat together and a lady or a gentleman passed whom one of them knew and saluted they all rose to their feet and took off their caps the members of a corps always received a fellow member in this way too but they paid no attention to members of other corps they did not seem to see them this was not a discourtesy it was only a part of the elaborate and rigid corps etiquette there seems to be no chilly distance existing between the german students and the professor but on the contrary a companionable intercourse the opposite of chilliness and reserve when the professor enters a beer hall in the evening where students are gathered together these rise up and take off their caps and invite the old gentleman to sit with them and partake he accepts and the pleasant talk and the beer flow for an hour or two and by and by the professor properly charged and comfortable gives a cordial good night while the students stand bowing and uncovered and then he moves on his happy way homeward with all his vast cargo of learning afloat in his hold nobody finds fault or feels outraged no harm has been done it seemed to be a part of corps etiquette to keep a dog or so too i mean a corps dog the common property of the organization like the corps steward or head servant then there are other dogs owned by individuals on a summer afternoon in the castle gardens i have seen six students march solemnly into the grounds in single file each carrying a bright chinese parasol and leading a prodigious dog by a string it was a very imposing spectacle sometimes there would be as many dogs around the pavilion as students and of all breeds and of all degrees of beauty and ugliness these dogs had a rather dry time of it for they were tied to the benches and had no amusement for an hour or two at a time except what they could get out of pawing at the gnats or trying to sleep and not succeeding however they got a lump of sugar occasionally they were fond of that it seemed right and proper that students should indulge in dogs but everybody else had them too old men and young ones old women and nice young ladies if there is one spectacle that is unpleasanter than another it is that of an elegantly dressed young lady towing a dog by a string it is said to be the sign and symbol of blighted love it seems to me that some other way of advertising it might be devised which would be just as conspicuous and yet not so trying to the proprieties it would be a mistake to suppose that the easy going pleasure seeking student carries an empty head just the contrary he has spent nine years in the gymnasium under a system which allowed him no freedom but vigorously compelled him to work like a slave consequently he has left the gymnasium with an education which is so extensive and complete that the most a university can do for it is to perfect some of its profounder specialties it is said that when a pupil leaves the gymnasium he not only has a comprehensive education but he knows what he knows it is not befogged with uncertainty it is burnt into him so that it will stay for instance he does not merely read and write greek but speaks it the same with the latin foreign youth steer clear of the gymnasium its rules are too severe they go to the university to put a mansard roof on their whole general education but the german student already has his mansard roof so he goes there to add a steeple in the nature of some specialty such as a particular branch of law or diseases of the eye or special study of the ancient gothic tongues so this german attends only the lectures which belong to the chosen branch and drinks his beer and tows his dog around and has a general good time the rest of the day he has been in rigid bondage so long that the large liberty of the university life is just what he needs and likes and thoroughly appreciates and as it cannot last forever he makes the most of it while it does last and so lays up a good rest against the day that must see him put on the chains once more and enter the slavery of official or professional life chapter v at the students dueling ground dueling by wholesale one day in the interest of science my agent obtained permission to bring me to the students dueling place we crossed the river and drove up the bank a few hundred yards then turned to the left entered a narrow alley followed it a hundred yards and arrived at a two story public house we were acquainted with its outside aspect for it was visible from the hotel we went upstairs and passed into a large whitewashed apartment which was perhaps fifty feet long by thirty feet wide and twenty or twenty five high it was a well lighted place there was no carpet across one end and down both sides of the room extended a row of tables and at these tables some fifty or seventy five students see appendix c were sitting some of them were sipping wine others were playing cards others chess other groups were chatting together and many were smoking cigarettes while they waited for the coming duels nearly all of them wore colored caps there were white caps green caps blue caps red caps and bright yellow ones so all the five corps were present in strong force in the windows at the vacant end of the room stood six or eight narrow bladed swords with large protecting guards for the hand and outside was a man at work sharpening others on a grindstone he understood his business for when a sword left his hand one could shave himself with it it was observable that the young gentlemen neither bowed to nor spoke with students whose caps differed in color from their own this did not mean hostility but only an armed neutrality it was considered that a person could strike harder in the duel and with a more earnest interest if he had never been in a condition of comradeship with his antagonist therefore comradeship between the corps was not permitted at intervals the presidents of the five corps have a cold official intercourse with each other but nothing further for example when the regular dueling day of one of the corps approaches its president calls for volunteers from among the membership to offer battle three or more respond but there must not be less than three the president lays their names before the other presidents with the request that they furnish antagonists for these challengers from among their corps this is promptly done it chanced that the present occasion was the battle day of the red cap corps they were the challengers and certain caps of other colors had volunteered to meet them the students fight duels in the room which i have described two days in every week during seven and a half or eight months in every year this custom had continued in germany two hundred and fifty years to return to my narrative a student in a white cap met us and introduced us to six or eight friends of his who also wore white caps and while we stood conversing two strange looking figures were led in from another room they were students panoplied for the duel they were bareheaded their eyes were protected by iron goggles which projected an inch or more the leather straps of which bound their ears flat against their heads were wound around and around with thick wrappings which a sword could not cut through from chin to ankle they were padded thoroughly against injury their arms were bandaged and rebandaged layer upon layer until they looked like solid black logs these weird apparitions had been handsome youths clad in fashionable attire fifteen minutes before but now they did not resemble any beings one ever sees unless in nightmares they strode along with their arms projecting straight out from their bodies they did not hold them out themselves but fellow students walked beside them and gave the needed support there was a rush for the vacant end of the room now and we followed and got good places the combatants were placed face to face each with several members of his own corps about him to assist two seconds well padded and with swords in their hands took their stations a student belonging to neither of the opposing corps placed himself in a good position to umpire the combat another student stood by with a watch and a memorandum book to keep record of the time and the number and nature of the wounds a gray haired surgeon was present with his lint his bandages and his instruments after a moments pause the duelists saluted the umpire respectfully then one after another the several officials stepped forward gracefully removed their caps and saluted him also and returned to their places everything was ready now students stood crowded together in the foreground and others stood behind them on chairs and tables every face was turned toward the center of attraction the combatants were watching each other with alert eyes a perfect stillness a breathless interest reigned i felt that i was going to see some wary work but not so the instant the word was given the two apparitions sprang forward and began to rain blows down upon each other with such lightning rapidity that i could not quite tell whether i saw the swords or only flashes they made in the air the rattling din of these blows as they struck steel or paddings was something wonderfully stirring and they were struck with such terrific force that i could not understand why the opposing sword was not beaten down under the assault presently in the midst of the sword flashes i saw a handful of hair skip into the air as if it had lain loose on the victims head and a breath of wind had puffed it suddenly away the seconds cried halt and knocked up the combatants swords with their own the duelists sat down a student official stepped forward examined the wounded head and touched the place with a sponge once or twice the surgeon came and turned back the hair from the wound and revealed a crimson gash two or three inches long and proceeded to bind an oval piece of leather and a bunch of lint over it the tally keeper stepped up and tallied one for the opposition in his book then the duelists took position again a small stream of blood was flowing down the side of the injured mans head and over his shoulder and down his body to the floor but he did not seem to mind this the word was given and they plunged at each other as fiercely as before once more the blows rained and rattled and flashed every few moments the quick eyed seconds would notice that a sword was bent then they called halt struck up the contending weapons and an assisting student straightened the bent one the wonderful turmoil went on presently a bright spark sprung from a blade and that blade broken in several pieces sent one of its fragments flying to the ceiling a new sword was provided and the fight proceeded the exercise was tremendous of course and in time the fighters began to show great fatigue they were allowed to rest a moment every little while they got other rests by wounding each other for then they could sit down while the doctor applied the lint and bandages the law is that the battle must continue fifteen minutes if the men can hold out and as the pauses do not count this duel was protracted to twenty or thirty minutes i judged at last it was decided that the men were too much wearied to do battle longer they were led away drenched with crimson from head to foot that was a good fight but it could not count partly because it did not last the lawful fifteen minutes of actual fighting and partly because neither man was disabled by his wound it was a drawn battle and corps law requires that drawn battles shall be refought as soon as the adversaries are well of their hurts during the conflict i had talked a little now and then with a young gentleman of the white cap corps and he had mentioned that he was to fight next and had also pointed out his challenger a young gentleman who was leaning against the opposite wall smoking a cigarette and restfully observing the duel then in progress my acquaintanceship with a party to the coming contest had the effect of giving me a kind of personal interest in it i naturally wished he might win and it was the reverse of pleasant to learn that he probably would not because although he was a notable swordsman the challenger was held to be his superior the duel presently began and in the same furious way which had marked the previous one i stood close by but could not tell which blows told and which did not they fell and vanished so like flashes of light they all seemed to tell the swords always bent over the opponents heads from the forehead back over the crown and seemed to touch all the way but it was not so a protecting blade invisible to me was always interposed between at the end of ten seconds each man had struck twelve or fifteen blows and warded off twelve or fifteen and no harm done then a sword became disabled and a short rest followed whilst a new one was brought early in the next round the white corps student got an ugly wound on the side of his head and gave his opponent one like it in the third round the latter received another bad wound in the head and the former had his under lip divided after that the white corps student gave many severe wounds but got none of the consequence in return at the end of five minutes from the beginning of the duel the surgeon stopped it the challenging party had suffered such injuries that any addition to them might be dangerous these injuries were a fearful spectacle but are better left undescribed so against expectation my acquaintance was the victor chapter vi a sport that sometimes kills the third duel was brief and bloody the surgeon stopped it when he saw that one of the men had received such bad wounds that he could not fight longer without endangering his life the fourth duel was a tremendous encounter but at the end of five or six minutes the surgeon interfered once more another man so severely hurt as to render it unsafe to add to his harms i watched this engagement as i watched the others with rapt interest and strong excitement and with a shrink and a shudder for every blow that laid open a cheek or a forehead and a conscious paling of my face when i occasionally saw a wound of a yet more shocking nature inflicted my eyes were upon the loser of this duel when he got his last and vanquishing wound it was in his face and it carried away his but no matter i must not enter into details i had but a glance and then turned quickly but i would not have been looking at all if i had known what was coming no that is probably not true one thinks he would not look if he knew what was coming but the interest and the excitement are so powerful that they would doubtless conquer all other feelings and so under the fierce exhilaration of the clashing steel he would yield and look after all sometimes spectators of these duels faint and it does seem a very reasonable thing to do too both parties to this fourth duel were badly hurt so much that the surgeon was at work upon them nearly or quite an hour a fact which is suggestive but this waiting interval was not wasted in idleness by the assembled students it was past noon therefore they ordered their landlord downstairs to send up hot beefsteaks chickens and such things and these they ate sitting comfortable at the several tables whilst they chatted disputed and laughed the door to the surgeons room stood open meantime but the cutting sewing splicing and bandaging going on in there in plain view did not seem to disturb anyones appetite i went in and saw the surgeon labor awhile but could not enjoy it was much less trying to see the wounds given and received than to see them mended the stir and turmoil and the music of the steel were wanting here ones nerves were wrung by this grisly spectacle whilst the duels compensating pleasurable thrill was lacking finally the doctor finished and the men who were to fight the closing battle of the day came forth a good many dinners were not completed yet but no matter they could be eaten cold after the battle therefore everybody crowded forth to see this was not a love duel but a satisfaction affair these two students had quarreled and were here to settle it they did not belong to any of the corps but they were furnished with weapons and armor and permitted to fight here by the five corps as a courtesy evidently these two young men were unfamiliar with the dueling ceremonies though they were not unfamiliar with the sword when they were placed in position they thought it was time to begin and then did begin too and with a most impetuous energy without waiting for anybody to give the word this vastly amused the spectators and even broke down their studied and courtly gravity and surprised them into laughter of course the seconds struck up the swords and started the duel over again at the word the deluge of blows began but before long the surgeon once more interfered for the only reason which ever permits him to interfere and the days war was over it was now two in the afternoon and i had been present since half past nine in the morning the field of battle was indeed a red one by this time but some sawdust soon righted that there had been one duel before i arrived in it one of the men received many injuries while the other one escaped without a scratch i had seen the heads and faces of ten youths gashed in every direction by the keen two edged blades and yet had not seen a victim wince nor heard a moan or detected any fleeting expression which confessed the sharp pain the hurts were inflicting this was good fortitude indeed such endurance is to be expected in savages and prize fighters for they are born and educated to it but to find it in such perfection in these gently bred and kindly natured young fellows is matter for surprise it was not merely under the excitement of the sword play that this fortitude was shown it was shown in the surgeons room where an uninspiring quiet reigned and where there was no audience the doctors manipulations brought out neither grimaces nor moans and in the fights it was observable that these lads hacked and slashed with the same tremendous spirit after they were covered with streaming wounds which they had shown in the beginning the world in general looks upon the college duels as very farcical affairs true but considering that the college duel is fought by boys that the swords are real swords and that the head and face are exposed it seems to me that it is a farce which had quite a grave side to it people laugh at it mainly because they think the student is so covered up with armor that he cannot be hurt but it is not so his eyes and ears are protected but the rest of his face and head are bare he can not only be badly wounded but his life is in danger and he would sometimes lose it but for the interference of the surgeon it is not intended that his life shall be endangered fatal accidents are possible however for instance the students sword may break and the end of it fly up behind his antagonists ear and cut an artery which could not be reached if the sword remained whole this has happened sometimes and death has resulted on the spot formerly the students armpits were not protected and at that time the swords were pointed whereas they are blunt now so an artery in the armpit was sometimes cut and death followed then in the days of sharp pointed swords a spectator was an occasional victim the end of a broken sword flew five or ten feet and buried itself in his neck or his heart and death ensued instantly the student duels in germany occasion two or three deaths every year now but this arises only from the carelessness of the wounded men they eat or drink imprudently or commit excesses in the way of overexertion inflammation sets in and gets such a headway that it cannot be arrested indeed there is blood and pain and danger enough about the college duel to entitle it to a considerable degree of respect all the customs all the laws all the details pertaining to the student duel are quaint and naive the grave precise and courtly ceremony with which the thing is conducted invests it with a sort of antique charm this dignity and these knightly graces suggest the tournament not the prize fight the laws are as curious as they are strict for instance the duelist may step forward from the line he is placed upon if he chooses but never back of it if he steps back of it or even leans back it is considered that he did it to avoid a blow or contrive an advantage so he is dismissed from his corps in disgrace it would seem natural to step from under a descending sword unconsciously and against ones will and intent yet this unconsciousness is not allowed again if under the sudden anguish of a wound the receiver of it makes a grimace he falls some degrees in the estimation of his fellows his corps are ashamed of him they call him hare foot which is the german equivalent for chicken hearted chapter vii how bismark fought in addition to the corps laws there are some corps usages which have the force of laws perhaps the president of a corps notices that one of the membership who is no longer an exempt that is a freshman has remained a sophomore some little time without volunteering to fight some day the president instead of calling for volunteers will appoint this sophomore to measure swords with a student of another corps he is free to decline everybody says so there is no compulsion this is all true but i have not heard of any student who did decline to decline and still remain in the corps would make him unpleasantly conspicuous and properly so since he knew when he joined that his main business as a member would be to fight no there is no law against declining except the law of custom which is confessedly stronger than written law everywhere the ten men whose duels i had witnessed did not go away when their hurts were dressed as i had supposed they would but came back one after another as soon as they were free of the surgeon and mingled with the assemblage in the dueling room the white cap student who won the second fight witnessed the remaining three and talked with us during the intermissions he could not talk very well because his opponents sword had cut his under lip in two and then the surgeon had sewed it together and overlaid it with a profusion of white plaster patches neither could he eat easily still he contrived to accomplish a slow and troublesome luncheon while the last duel was preparing the man who was the worst hurt of all played chess while waiting to see this engagement a good part of his face was covered with patches and bandages and all the rest of his head was covered and concealed by them it is said that the student likes to appear on the street and in other public places in this kind of array and that this predilection often keeps him out when exposure to rain or sun is a positive danger for him newly bandaged students are a very common spectacle in the public gardens of heidelberg it is also said that the student is glad to get wounds in the face because the scars they leave will show so well there and it is also said that these face wounds are so prized that youths have even been known to pull them apart from time to time and put red wine in them to make them heal badly and leave as ugly a scar as possible it does not look reasonable but it is roundly asserted and maintained nevertheless i am sure of one thing scars are plenty enough in germany among the young men and very grim ones they are too they crisscross the face in angry red welts and are permanent and ineffaceable some of these scars are of a very strange and dreadful aspect and the effect is striking when several such accent the milder ones which form a city map on a mans face they suggest the burned district then we had often noticed that many of the students wore a colored silk band or ribbon diagonally across their breasts it transpired that this signifies that the wearer has fought three duels in which a decision was reached duels in which he either whipped or was whipped for drawn battles do not count after a student has received his ribbon he is free he can cease from fighting without reproach except some one insult him his president cannot appoint him to fight he can volunteer if he wants to or remain quiescent if he prefers to do so statistics show that he does not prefer to remain quiescent they show that the duel has a singular fascination about it somewhere for these free men so far from resting upon the privilege of the badge are always volunteering a corps student told me it was of record that prince bismarck fought thirty two of these duels in a single summer term when he was in college so he fought twenty nine after his badge had given him the right to retire from the field from my diary dined in a hotel a few miles up the neckar in a room whose walls were hung all over with framed portrait groups of the five corps some were recent but many antedated photography and were pictured in lithography the dates ranged back to forty or fifty years ago nearly every individual wore the ribbon across his breast in one portrait group representing as each of these pictures did an entire corps i took pains to count the ribbons there were twenty seven members and twenty one of them wore that significant badge the statistics may be found to possess interest in several particulars two days in every week are devoted to dueling the rule is rigid that there must be three duels on each of these days there are generally more but there cannot be fewer there were six the day i was present sometimes there are seven or eight it is insisted that eight duels a week four for each of the two days is too low an average to draw a calculation from but i will reckon from that basis preferring an understatement to an overstatement of the case this requires about four hundred and eighty or five hundred duelists a year for in summer the college term is about three and a half months and in winter it is four months and sometimes longer of the seven hundred and fifty students in the university at the time i am writing of only eighty belonged to the five corps and it is only these corps that do the dueling occasionally other students borrow the arms and battleground of the five corps in order to settle a quarrel but this does not happen every dueling day consequently eighty youths furnish the material for some two hundred and fifty duels a year this average gives six fights a year to each of the eighty this large work could not be accomplished if the badge holders stood upon their privilege and ceased to volunteer they have to borrow the arms because they could not get them elsewhere or otherwise as i understand it the public authorities all over germany allow the five corps to keep swords but do not allow them to use them this is law is rigid it is only the execution of it that is lax of course where there is so much fighting the students make it a point to keep themselves in constant practice with the foil one often sees them at the tables in the castle grounds using their whips or canes to illustrate some new sword trick which they have heard about and between the duels on the day whose history i have been writing the swords were not always idle every now and then we heard a succession of the keen hissing sounds which the sword makes when it is being put through its paces in the air and this informed us that a student was practicing necessarily this unceasing attention to the art develops an expert occasionally he becomes famous in his own university his renown spreads to other universities he is invited to goettingen to fight with a goettingen expert if he is victorious he will be invited to other colleges or those colleges will send their experts to him americans and englishmen often join one or another of the five corps a year or two ago the principal heidelberg expert was a big kentuckian he was invited to the various universities and left a wake of victory behind him all about germany but at last a little student in strasburg defeated him there was formerly a student in heidelberg who had picked up somewhere and mastered a peculiar trick of cutting up under instead of cleaving down from above while the trick lasted he won in sixteen successive duels in his university but by that time observers had discovered what his charm was and how to break it therefore his championship ceased a rule which forbids social intercourse between members of different corps is strict in the dueling house in the parks on the street and anywhere and everywhere that the students go caps of a color group themselves together if all the tables in a public garden were crowded but one and that one had two red cap students at it and ten vacant places the yellow caps the blue caps the white caps and the green caps seeking seats would go by that table and not seem to see it nor seem to be aware that there was such a table in the grounds the student by whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the dueling place wore the white cap prussian corps he introduced us to many white caps but to none of another color the corps etiquette extended even to us who were strangers and required us to group with the white corps only and speak only with the white corps while we were their guests and keep aloof from the caps of the other colors once i wished to examine some of the swords but an american student said it would not be quite polite these now in the windows all have red hilts or blue they will bring in some with white hilts presently and those you can handle freely when a sword was broken in the first duel i wanted a piece of it but its hilt was the wrong color so it was considered best and politest to await a properer season it was brought to me after the room was cleared and i will now make a life size sketch of it by tracing a line around it with my pen to show the width of the weapon figure the length of these swords is about three feet and they are quite heavy ones disposition to cheer during the course of the duels or at their close was naturally strong but corps etiquette forbade any demonstrations of this sort however brilliant a contest or a victory might be no sign or sound betrayed that any one was moved a dignified gravity and repression were maintained at all times when the dueling was finished and we were ready to go the gentlemen of the prussian corps to whom we had been introduced took off their caps in the courteous german way and also shook hands their brethren of the same order took off their caps and bowed but without shaking hands the gentlemen of the other corps treated us just as they would have treated white caps they fell apart apparently unconsciously and left us an unobstructed pathway but did not seem to see us or know we were there if we had gone thither the following week as guests of another corps the white caps without meaning any offense would have observed the etiquette of their order and ignored our presence how strangely are comedy and tragedy blended in this life i had not been home a full half hour after witnessing those playful sham duels when circumstances made it necessary for me to get ready immediately to assist personally at a real one a duel with no effeminate limitation in the matter of results but a battle to the death an account of it in the next chapter will show the reader that duels between boys for fun and duels between men in earnest are very different affairs a tramp abroad

of the most dangerous institutions of our day since it is always fought in the open air the combatants are nearly sure to catch coldm paul de cassagnac the most inveterate of the french duelists had suffered so often in this way that he is at last a confirmed invalid and the best physician in paris has expressed the opinion that if he goes on dueling for fifteen or twenty years more unless he forms the habit of fighting in a comfortable room where damps and draughts cannot intrude he will eventually endanger his life this ought to moderate the talk of those people who are so stubborn in maintaining that the french duel is the most health giving of recreations because of the open air exercise it affords and it ought also to moderate that foolish talk about french duelists and socialist hated monarchs being the only people who are immortal but it is time to get at my subject as soon as i heard of the late fiery outbreak between m gambetta and m fourtou in the french assembly i knew that trouble must follow i knew it because a long personal friendship with m gambetta revealed to me the desperate and implacable nature of the man vast as are his physical proportions i knew that the thirst for revenge would penetrate to the remotest frontiers of his person i did not wait for him to call on me but went at once to him as i had expected i found the brave fellow steeped in a profound french calm i say french calm because french calmness and english calmness have points of difference he was moving swiftly back and forth among the debris of his furniture now and then staving chance fragments of it across the room with his foot grinding a constant grist of curses through his set teeth and halting every little while to deposit another handful of his hair on the pile which he had been building of it on the table he threw his arms around my neck bent me over his stomach to his breast kissed me on both cheeks hugged me four or five times and then placed me in his own arm chair as soon as i had got well again we began business at once i said i supposed he would wish me to act as his second and he said of course i said i must be allowed to act under a french name so that i might be shielded from obloquy in my country in case of fatal results he winced here probably at the suggestion that dueling was not regarded with respect in america however he agreed to my requirement this accounts for the fact that in all the newspaper reports m gambettas second was apparently a frenchman first we drew up my principals will i insisted upon this and stuck to my point i said i had never heard of a man in his right mind going out to fight a duel without first making his will he said he had never heard of a man in his right mind doing anything of the kind when he had finished the will he wished to proceed to a choice of his last words he wanted to know how the following words as a dying exclamation struck me i die for my god for my country for freedom of speech for progress and the universal brotherhood of man i objected that this would require too lingering a death it was a good speech for a consumptive but not suited to the exigencies of the field of honor we wrangled over a good many ante mortem outbursts but i finally got him to cut his obituary down to this which he copied into his memorandum book purposing to get it by heart i die that france might live i said that this remark seemed to lack relevancy but he said relevancy was a matter of no consequence in last words what you wanted was thrill the next thing in order was the choice of weapons my principal said he was not feeling well and would leave that and the other details of the proposed meeting to me therefore i wrote the following note and carried it to m fourtous friend sirm gambetta accepts m fourtous challenge and authorizes me to propose plessis piquet as the place of meeting tomorrow morning at daybreak as the time and axes as the weapons i am sir with great respect mark twain m fourtous friend read this note and shuddered then he turned to me and said with a suggestion of severity in his tone have you considered sir what would be the inevitable result of such a meeting as this well for instance what would it be bloodshed thats about the size of it i said now if it is a fair question what was your side proposing to shed i had him there he saw he had made a blunder so he hastened to explain it away he said he had spoken jestingly then he added that he and his principal would enjoy axes and indeed prefer them but such weapons were barred by the french code and so i must change my proposal i walked the floor turning the thing over in my mind and finally it occurred to me that gatling guns at fifteen paces would be a likely way to get a verdict on the field of honor so i framed this idea into a proposition but it was not accepted the code was in the way again i proposed rifles then double barreled shotguns then colts navy revolvers these being all rejected i reflected awhile and sarcastically suggested brickbats at three quarters of a mile i always hate to fool away a humorous thing on a person who has no perception of humor and it filled me with bitterness when this man went soberly away to submit the last proposition to his principal he came back presently and said his principal was charmed with the idea of brickbats at three quarters of a mile but must decline on account of the danger to disinterested parties passing between them then i said well i am at the end of my string now perhaps you would be good enough to suggest a weapon perhaps you have even had one in your mind all the time his countenance brightened and he said with alacrity oh without doubt monsieur so he fell to hunting in his pockets pocket after pocket and he had plenty of them muttering all the while now what could i have done with them at last he was successful he fished out of his vest pocket a couple of little things which i carried to the light and ascertained to be pistols they were single barreled and silver mounted and very dainty and pretty i was not able to speak for emotion i silently hung one of them on my watch chain and returned the other my companion in crime now unrolled a postage stamp containing several cartridges and gave me one of them i asked if he meant to signify by this that our men were to be allowed but one shot apiece he replied that the french code permitted no more i then begged him to go and suggest a distance for my mind was growing weak and confused under the strain which had been put upon it he named sixty five yards i nearly lost my patience i said sixty five yards with these instruments squirt guns would be deadlier at fifty consider my friend you and i are banded together to destroy life not make it eternal but with all my persuasions all my arguments i was only able to get him to reduce the distance to thirty five yards and even this concession he made with reluctance and said with a sigh i wash my hands of this slaughter on your head be it there was nothing for me but to go home to my old lion heart and tell my humiliating story when i enteredm gambetta was laying his last lock of hair upon the altar he sprang toward me exclaiming you have made the fatal arrangements i see it in your eye i have his face paled a trifle and he leaned upon the table for support he breathed thick and heavily for a moment or two so tumultuous were his feelings then he hoarsely whispered the weapon the weapon quick what is the weapon this and i displayed that silver mounted thing he cast but one glance at it then swooned ponderously to the floor when he came to he said mournfully the unnatural calm to which i have subjected myself has told upon my nerves but away with weakness i will confront my fate like a man and a frenchman he rose to his feet and assumed an attitude which for sublimity has never been approached by man and has seldom been surpassed by statues then he said in his deep bass tones behold i am calm i am ready reveal to me the distance thirty five yards i could not lift him up of course but i rolled him over and poured water down his back he presently came to and said thirty five yards without a rest but why ask since murder was that mans intention why should he palter with small details but mark you one thing in my fall the world shall see how the chivalry of france meets death after a long silence he asked was nothing said about that mans family standing up with him as an offset to my bulk but no matter i would not stoop to make such a suggestion if he is not noble enough to suggest it himself he is welcome to this advantage which no honorable man would take he now sank into a sort of stupor of reflection which lasted some minutes after which he broke silence with the hour what is the hour fixed for the collision dawn tomorrow he seemed greatly surprised and immediately said insanity i never heard of such a thing nobody is abroad at such an hour that is the reason i named it do you mean to say you want an audience it is no time to bandy words i am astonished that m fourtou should ever have agreed to so strange an innovation go at once and require a later hour i ran downstairs threw open the front door and almost plunged into the arms of m fourtous second he said i have the honor to say that my principal strenuously objects to the hour chosen and begs you will consent to change it to half past nine any courtesy sir which it is in our power to extend is at the service of your excellent principal we agree to the proposed change of time i beg you to accept the thanks of my client then he turned to a person behind him and said you hearm noir the hour is altered to half past nine whereupon m noir bowed expressed his thanks and went away my accomplice continued if agreeable to you your chief surgeons and ours shall proceed to the field in the same carriage as is customary it is entirely agreeable to me and i am obliged to you for mentioning the surgeons for i am afraid i should not have thought of them how many shall i want i supposed two or three will be enough two is the customary number for each party i refer to chief surgeons but considering the exalted positions occupied by our clients it will be well and decorous that each of us appoint several consulting surgeons from among the highest in the profession these will come in their own private carriages have you engaged a hearse bless my stupidity i never thought of it i will attend to it right away i must seem very ignorant to you but you must try to overlook that because i have never had any experience of such a swell duel as this before i have had a good deal to do with duels on the pacific coast but i see now that they were crude affairs a hearse sho we used to leave the elected lying around loose and let anybody cord them up and cart them off that wanted to have you anything further to suggest nothing except that the head undertakers shall ride together as is usual the subordinates and mutes will go on foot as is also usual i will see you at eight o clock in the morning and we will then arrange the order of the procession i have the honor to bid you a good day i returned to my client who said very well at what hour is the engagement to begin half past nine very good indeed have you sent the fact to the newspapers sir if after our long and intimate friendship you can for a moment deem me capable of so base a treachery tut tut what words are these my dear friend have i wounded you ah forgive me i am overloading you with labor therefore go on with the other details and drop this one from your list the bloody minded fourtou will be sure to attend to it or i myself yes to make certain i will drop a note to my journalistic friendm noir oh come to think of it you may save yourself the trouble that other second has informed m noir h m i might have known it it is just like that fourtou who always wants to make a display at half past nine in the morning the procession approached the field of plessis piquet in the following order first came our carriage nobody in it but m gambetta and myself then a carriage containing m fourtou and his second then a carriage containing two poet orators who did not believe in god and these had ms funeral orations projecting from their breast pockets then a carriage containing the head surgeons and their cases of instruments then eight private carriages containing consulting surgeons then a hack containing a coroner then the two hearses then a carriage containing the head undertakers then a train of assistants and mutes on foot and after these came plodding through the fog a long procession of camp followers police and citizens generally it was a noble turnout and would have made a fine display if we had had thinner weather there was no conversation i spoke several times to my principal but i judge he was not aware of it for he always referred to his note book and muttered absently i die that france might live arrived on the field my fellow second and i paced off the thirty five yards and then drew lots for choice of position this latter was but an ornamental ceremony for all the choices were alike in such weather these preliminaries being ended i went to my principal and asked him if he was ready he spread himself out to his full width and said in a stern voice ready let the batteries be charged the loading process was done in the presence of duly constituted witnesses we considered it best to perform this delicate service with the assistance of a lantern on account of the state of the weather we now placed our men at this point the police noticed that the public had massed themselves together on the right and left of the field they therefore begged a delay while they should put these poor people in a place of safety the request was granted the police having ordered the two multitudes to take positions behind the duelists we were once more ready the weather growing still more opaque it was agreed between myself and the other second that before giving the fatal signal we should each deliver a loud whoop to enable the combatants to ascertain each others whereabouts i now returned to my principal and was distressed to observe that he had lost a good deal of his spirit i tried my best to hearten him i said indeed sir things are not as bad as they seem considering the character of the weapons the limited number of shots allowed the generous distance the impenetrable solidity of the fog and the added fact that one of the combatants is one eyed and the other cross eyed and near sighted it seems to me that this conflict need not necessarily be fatal there are chances that both of you may survive therefore cheer up do not be downhearted this speech had so good an effect that my principal immediately stretched forth his hand and said i am myself again give me the weapon i laid it all lonely and forlorn in the center of the vast solitude of his palm he gazed at it and shuddered and still mournfully contemplating it he murmured in a broken voice alas it is not death i dread but mutilation i heartened him once more and with such success that he presently said let the tragedy begin stand at my back do not desert me in this solemn hour my friend i gave him my promise i now assisted him to point his pistol toward the spot where i judged his adversary to be standing and cautioned him to listen well and further guide himself by my fellow seconds whoop then i propped myself against m gambettas back and raised a rousing whoop ee this was answered from out the far distances of the fog and i immediately shouted one two three fire two little sounds like spit spit broke upon my ear and in the same instant i was crushed to the earth under a mountain of flesh bruised as i was i was still able to catch a faint accent from above to this effect i die for for perdition take it what is it i die for oh yes france i die that france may live the surgeons swarmed around with their probes in their hands and applied their microscopes to the whole area of m gambettas person with the happy result of finding nothing in the nature of a wound then a scene ensued which was in every way gratifying and inspiriting the two gladiators fell upon each others neck with floods of proud and happy tears that other second embraced me the surgeons the orators the undertakers the police everybody embraced everybody congratulated everybody cried and the whole atmosphere was filled with praise and with joy unspeakable it seems to me then that i would rather be a hero of a french duel than a crowned and sceptered monarch when the commotion had somewhat subsided the body of surgeons held a consultation and after a good deal of debate decided that with proper care and nursing there was reason to believe that i would survive my injuries my internal hurts were deemed the most serious since it was apparent that a broken rib had penetrated my left lung and that many of my organs had been pressed out so far to one side or the other of where they belonged that it was doubtful if they would ever learn to perform their functions in such remote and unaccustomed localities they then set my left arm in two places pulled my right hip into its socket again and re elevated my nose i was an object of great interest and even admiration and many sincere and warm hearted persons had themselves introduced to me and said they were proud to know the only man who had been hurt in a french duel in forty years i was placed in an ambulance at the very head of the procession and thus with gratifying eclat i was marched into paris the most conspicuous figure in that great spectacle and deposited at the hospital the cross of the legion of honor has been conferred upon me however few escape that distinction such is the true version of the most memorable private conflict of the age i have no complaints to make against any one i acted for myself and i can stand the consequences without boasting i think i may say i am not afraid to stand before a modern french duelist but as long as i keep in my right mind i will never consent to stand behind one again chapter ix what the beautiful maiden said one day we took the train and went down to mannheim to see king lear played in german it was a mistake we sat in our seats three whole hours and never understood anything but the thunder and lightning and even that was reversed to suit german ideas for the thunder came first and the lightning followed after the behavior of the audience was perfect there were no rustlings or whisperings or other little disturbances each act was listened to in silence and the applauding was done after the curtain was down the doors opened at half past four the play began promptly at half past five and within two minutes afterward all who were coming were in their seats and quiet reigned a german gentleman in the train had said that a shakespearian play was an appreciated treat in germany and that we should find the house filled it was true all the six tiers were filled and remained so to the end which suggested that it is not only balcony people who like shakespeare in germany but those of the pit and gallery too another time we went to mannheim and attended a shivaree otherwise an opera the one called lohengrin the banging and slamming and booming and crashing were something beyond belief the racking and pitiless pain of it remains stored up in my memory alongside the memory of the time that i had my teeth fixed there were circumstances which made it necessary for me to stay through the four hours to the end and i stayed but the recollection of that long dragging relentless season of suffering is indestructible to have to endure it in silence and sitting still made it all the harder i was in a railed compartment with eight or ten strangers of the two sexes and this compelled repression yet at times the pain was so exquisite that i could hardly keep the tears back at those times as the howlings and wailings and shrieking of the singers and the ragings and roarings and explosions of the vast orchestra rose higher and higher and wilder and wilder and fiercer and fiercer i could have cried if i had been alone those strangers would not have been surprised to see a man do such a thing who was being gradually skinned but they would have marveled at it here and made remarks about it no doubt whereas there was nothing in the present case which was an advantage over being skinned there was a wait of half an hour at the end of the first act and i could have gone out and rested during that time but i could not trust myself to do it for i felt that i should desert to stay out there was another wait of half an hour toward nine o clock but i had gone through so much by that time that i had no spirit left and so had no desire but to be let alone i do not wish to suggest that the rest of the people there were like me for indeed they were not whether it was that they naturally liked that noise or whether it was that they had learned to like it by getting used to it i did not at the time know but they did like it this was plain enough while it was going on they sat and looked as rapt and grateful as cats do when one strokes their backs and whenever the curtain fell they rose to their feet in one solid mighty multitude and the air was snowed thick with waving handkerchiefs and hurricanes of applause swept the place this was not comprehensible to me of course there were many people there who were not under compulsion to stay yet the tiers were as full at the close as they had been at the beginning this showed that the people liked it it was a curious sort of a play in the manner of costumes and scenery it was fine and showy enough but there was not much action that is to say there was not much really done it was only talked about and always violently it was what one might call a narrative play everybody had a narrative and a grievance and none were reasonable about it but all in an offensive and ungovernable state there was little of that sort of customary thing where the tenor and the soprano stand down by the footlights warbling with blended voices and keep holding out their arms toward each other and drawing them back and spreading both hands over first one breast and then the other with a shake and a pressure no it was every rioter for himself and no blending each sang his indictive narrative in turn accompanied by the whole orchestra of sixty instruments and when this had continued for some time and one was hoping they might come to an understanding and modify the noise a great chorus composed entirely of maniacs would suddenly break forth and then during two minutes and sometimes three i lived over again all that i suffered the time the orphan asylum burned down we only had one brief little season of heaven and heavens sweet ecstasy and peace during all this long and diligent and acrimonious reproduction of the other place this was while a gorgeous procession of people marched around and around in the third act and sang the wedding chorus to my untutored ear that was music almost divine music while my seared soul was steeped in the healing balm of those gracious sounds it seemed to me that i could almost resuffer the torments which had gone before in order to be so healed again there is where the deep ingenuity of the operatic idea is betrayed it deals so largely in pain that its scattered delights are prodigiously augmented by the contrasts a pretty air in an opera is prettier there than it could be anywhere else i suppose just as an honest man in politics shines more than he would elsewhere i have since found out that there is nothing the germans like so much as an opera they like it not in a mild and moderate way but with their whole hearts this is a legitimate result of habit and education our nation will like the opera too by and by no doubt one in fifty of those who attend our operas likes it already perhaps but i think a good many of the other forty nine go in order to learn to like it and the rest in order to be able to talk knowingly about it the latter usually hum the airs while they are being sung so that their neighbors may perceive that they have been to operas before the funerals of these do not occur often enough a gentle old maidish person and a sweet young girl of seventeen sat right in front of us that night at the mannheim opera these people talked between the acts and i understood them though i understood nothing that was uttered on the distant stage at first they were guarded in their talk but after they had heard my agent and me conversing in english they dropped their reserve and i picked up many of their little confidences no i mean many of her little confidences meaning the elder party for the young girl only listened and gave assenting nods but never said a word how pretty she was and how sweet she was i wished she would speak but evidently she was absorbed in her own thoughts her own young girl dreams and found a dearer pleasure in silence but she was not dreaming sleepy dreams no she was awake alive alert she could not sit still a moment she was an enchanting study her gown was of a soft white silky stuff that clung to her round young figure like a fishs skin and it was rippled over with the gracefulest little fringy films of lace she had deep tender eyes with long curved lashes and she had peachy cheeks and a dimpled chin and such a dear little rosebud of a mouth and she was so dovelike so pure and so gracious so sweet and so bewitching for long hours i did mightily wish she would speak and at last she did the red lips parted and out leaps her thought and with such a guileless and pretty enthusiasm too auntie i just know i ve got five hundred fleas on me that was probably over the average yes it must have been very much over the average the average at that time in the grand duchy of baden was forty five to a young person when alone according to the official estimate of the home secretary for that year the average for older people was shifty and indeterminable for whenever a wholesome young girl came into the presence of her elders she immediately lowered their average and raised her own she became a sort of contribution box this dear young thing in the theater had been sitting there unconsciously taking up a collection many a skinny old being in our neighborhood was the happier and the restfuler for her coming in that large audience that night there were eight very conspicuous people these were ladies who had their hats or bonnets on what a blessed thing it would be if a lady could make herself conspicuous in our theaters by wearing her hat it is not usual in europe to allow ladies and gentlemen to take bonnets hats overcoats canes or umbrellas into the auditorium but in mannheim this rule was not enforced because the audiences were largely made up of people from a distance and among these were always a few timid ladies who were afraid that if they had to go into an anteroom to get their things when the play was over they would miss their train but the great mass of those who came from a distance always ran the risk and took the chances preferring the loss of a train to a breach of good manners and the discomfort of being unpleasantly conspicuous during a stretch of three or four hours chapter x how wagner operas bang along three or four hours that is a long time to sit in one place whether one be conspicuous or not yet some of wagners operas bang along for six whole hours on a stretch but the people sit there and enjoy it all and wish it would last longer a german lady in munich told me that a person could not like wagners music at first but must go through the deliberate process of learning to like it then he would have his sure reward for when he had learned to like it he would hunger for it and never be able to get enough of it she said that six hours of wagner was by no means too much she said that this composer had made a complete revolution in music and was burying the old masters one by one and she said that wagners operas differed from all others in one notable respect and that was that they were not merely spotted with music here and there but were all music from the first strain to the last this surprised me i said i had attended one of his insurrections and found hardly any music in it except the wedding chorus she said lohengrin was noisier than wagners other operas but that if i would keep on going to see it i would find by and by that it was all music and therefore would then enjoy it i could have said but would you advise a person to deliberately practice having a toothache in the pit of his stomach for a couple of years in order that he might then come to enjoy it but i reserved that remark this lady was full of the praises of the head tenor who had performed in a wagner opera the night before and went on to enlarge upon his old and prodigious fame and how many honors had been lavished upon him by the princely houses of germany here was another surprise i had attended that very opera in the person of my agent and had made close and accurate observations so i said why madam my experience warrants me in stating that that tenors voice is not a voice at all but only a shriek the shriek of a hyena that is very true she said he cannot sing now it is already many years that he has lost his voice but in other times he sang yes divinely so whenever he comes now you shall see yes that the theater will not hold the people jawohl bei gott his voice is wunderschoen in that past time i said she was discovering to me a kindly trait in the germans which was worth emulating i said that over the water we were not quite so generous that with us when a singer had lost his voice and a jumper had lost his legs these parties ceased to draw i said i had been to the opera in hanover once and in mannheim once and in munich through my authorized agent once and this large experience had nearly persuaded me that the germans preferred singers who couldnt sing this was not such a very extravagant speech either for that burly mannheim tenors praises had been the talk of all heidelberg for a week before his performance took place yet his voice was like the distressing noise which a nail makes when you screech it across a window pane i said so to heidelberg friends the next day and they said in the calmest and simplest way that that was very true but that in earlier times his voice had been wonderfully fine and the tenor in hanover was just another example of this sort the english speaking german gentleman who went with me to the opera there was brimming with enthusiasm over that tenor he said ach gott a great man you shall see him he is so celebrate in all germany and he has a pension yes from the government he not obliged to sing now only twice every year but if he not sing twice each year they take him his pension away very well we went when the renowned old tenor appeared i got a nudge and an excited whisper now you see him but the celebrate was an astonishing disappointment to me if he had been behind a screen i should have supposed they were performing a surgical operation on him i looked at my friend to my great surprise he seemed intoxicated with pleasure his eyes were dancing with eager delight when the curtain at last fell he burst into the stormiest applause and kept it up as did the whole house until the afflictive tenor had come three times before the curtain to make his bow while the glowing enthusiast was swabbing the perspiration from his face i said i dont mean the least harm but really now do you think he can sing him no gott im himmel aber how he has been able to sing twenty five years ago then pensively ach no now he not sing any more he only cry when he think he sing now he not sing at all no he only make like a cat which is unwell where and how did we get the idea that the germans are a stolid phlegmatic race in truth they are widely removed from that they are warm hearted emotional impulsive enthusiastic their tears come at the mildest touch and it is not hard to move them to laughter they are the very children of impulse we are cold and self contained compared to the germans they hug and kiss and cry and shout and dance and sing and where we use one loving petting expression they pour out a score their language is full of endearing diminutives nothing that they love escapes the application of a petting diminutive neither the house nor the dog nor the horse nor the grandmother nor any other creature animate or inanimate in the theaters at hanover hamburg and mannheim they had a wise custom the moment the curtain went up the light in the body of the house went down the audience sat in the cool gloom of a deep twilight which greatly enhanced the glowing splendors of the stage it saved gas too and people were not sweated to death when i saw king lear played nobody was allowed to see a scene shifted if there was nothing to be done but slide a forest out of the way and expose a temple beyond one did not see that forest split itself in the middle and go shrieking away with the accompanying disenchanting spectacle of the hands and heels of the impelling impulse no the curtain was always dropped for an instant one heard not the least movement behind it but when it went up the next instant the forest was gone even when the stage was being entirely reset one heard no noise during the whole time that king lear was playing the curtain was never down two minutes at any one time the orchestra played until the curtain was ready to go up for the first time then they departed for the evening where the stage waits never reach two minutes there is no occasion for music i had never seen this two minute business between acts but once before and that was when the shaughraun was played at wallacks i was at a concert in munich one night the people were streaming in the clock hand pointed to seven the music struck up and instantly all movement in the body of the house ceased nobody was standing or walking up the aisles or fumbling with a seat the stream of incomers had suddenly dried up at its source i listened undisturbed to a piece of music that was fifteen minutes long always expecting some tardy ticket holders to come crowding past my knees and being continuously and pleasantly disappointed but when the last note was struck here came the stream again you see they had made those late comers wait in the comfortable waiting parlor from the time the music had begun until it was ended it was the first time i had ever seen this sort of criminals denied the privilege of destroying the comfort of a house full of their betters some of these were pretty fine birds but no matter they had to tarry outside in the long parlor under the inspection of a double rank of liveried footmen and waiting maids who supported the two walls with their backs and held the wraps and traps of their masters and mistresses on their arms we had no footmen to hold our things and it was not permissible to take them into the concert room but there were some men and women to take charge of them for us they gave us checks for them and charged a fixed price payable in advance five cents in germany they always hear one thing at an opera which has never yet been heard in america perhaps i mean the closing strain of a fine solo or duet we always smash into it with an earthquake of applause the result is that we rob ourselves of the sweetest part of the treat we get the whiskey but we dont get the sugar in the bottom of the glass our way of scattering applause along through an act seems to me to be better than the mannheim way of saving it all up till the act is ended i do not see how an actor can forget himself and portray hot passion before a cold still audience i should think he would feel foolish it is a pain to me to this day to remember how that old german lear raged and wept and howled around the stage with never a response from that hushed house never a single outburst till the act was ended to me there was something unspeakably uncomfortable in the solemn dead silences that always followed this old persons tremendous outpourings of his feelings i could not help putting myself in his place i thought i knew how sick and flat he felt during those silences because i remembered a case which came under my observation once and which but i will tell the incident one evening on board a mississippi steamboat a boy of ten years lay asleep in a berth a long slim legged boy he was encased in quite a short shirt it was the first time he had ever made a trip on a steamboat and so he was troubled and scared and had gone to bed with his head filled with impending snaggings and explosions and conflagrations and sudden death about ten o clock some twenty ladies were sitting around about the ladies saloon quietly reading sewing embroidering and so on and among them sat a sweet benignant old dame with round spectacles on her nose and her busy knitting needles in her hands now all of a sudden into the midst of this peaceful scene burst that slim shanked boy in the brief shirt wild eyed erect haired and shouting fire fire jump and run the boats afire and there aint a minute to lose all those ladies looked sweetly up and smiled nobody stirred the old lady pulled her spectacles down looked over them and said gently but you mustnt catch cold child run and put on your breastpin and then come and tell us all about it it was a cruel chill to give to a poor little devils gushing vehemence he was expecting to be a sort of hero the creator of a wild panic and here everybody sat and smiled a mocking smile and an old woman made fun of his bugbear i turned and crept away for i was that boy and never even cared to discover whether i had dreamed the fire or actually seen it i am told that in a german concert or opera they hardly ever encore a song that though they may be dying to hear it again their good breeding usually preserves them against requiring the repetition kings may encore that is quite another matter it delights everybody to see that the king is pleased and as to the actor encored his pride and gratification are simply boundless still there are circumstances in which even a royal encore but it is better to illustrate the king of bavaria is a poet and has a poets eccentricities with the advantage over all other poets of being able to gratify them no matter what form they may take he is fond of opera but not fond of sitting in the presence of an audience therefore it has sometimes occurred in munich that when an opera has been concluded and the players were getting off their paint and finery a command has come to them to get their paint and finery on again presently the king would arrive solitary and alone and the players would begin at the beginning and do the entire opera over again with only that one individual in the vast solemn theater for audience once he took an odd freak into his head high up and out of sight over the prodigious stage of the court theater is a maze of interlacing water pipes so pierced that in case of fire innumerable little thread like streams of water can be caused to descend and in case of need this discharge can be augmented to a pouring flood american managers might want to make a note of that the king was sole audience the opera proceeded it was a piece with a storm in it the mimic thunder began to mutter the mimic wind began to wail and sough and the mimic rain to patter the kings interest rose higher and higher it developed into enthusiasm he cried out it is very very good indeed but i will have real rain turn on the water the manager pleaded for a reversal of the command said it would ruin the costly scenery and the splendid costumes but the king cried no matter no matter i will have real rain turn on the water so the real rain was turned on and began to descend in gossamer lances to the mimic flower beds and gravel walks of the stage the richly dressed actresses and actors tripped about singing bravely and pretending not to mind it the king was delighted his enthusiasm grew higher he cried out bravo bravo more thunder more lightning turn on more rain the thunder boomed the lightning glared the storm winds raged the deluge poured down the mimic royalty on the stage with their soaked satins clinging to their bodies slopped about ankle deep in water warbling their sweetest and best the fiddlers under the eaves of the stage sawed away for dear life with the cold overflow spouting down the backs of their necks and the dry and happy king sat in his lofty box and wore his gloves to ribbons applauding more yet cried the king more yet let loose all the thunder turn on all the water i will hang the man that raises an umbrella when this most tremendous and effective storm that had ever been produced in any theater was at last over the kings approbation was measureless he cried magnificent magnificent encore do it again but the manager succeeded in persuading him to recall the encore and said the company would feel sufficiently rewarded and complimented in the mere fact that the encore was desired by his majesty without fatiguing him with a repetition to gratify their own vanity during the remainder of the act the lucky performers were those whose parts required changes of dress the others were a soaked bedraggled and uncomfortable lot but in the last degree picturesque the stage scenery was ruined trap doors were so swollen that they wouldnt work for a week afterward the fine costumes were spoiled and no end of minor damages were done by that remarkable storm it was a royal idea that storm and royally carried out but observe the moderation of the king he did not insist upon his encore if he had been a gladsome unreflecting american opera audience he probably would have had his storm repeated and repeated until he drowned all those people chapter xi i paint a turner the summer days passed pleasantly in heidelberg we had a skilled trainer and under his instructions we were getting our legs in the right condition for the contemplated pedestrian tours we were well satisfied with the progress which we had made in the german language see appendix d for information concerning this fearful tongue and more than satisfied with what we had accomplished in art we had had the best instructors in drawing and painting in germany haemmerling vogel mueller dietz and schumann haemmerling taught us landscape painting vogel taught us figure drawing mueller taught us to do still life and dietz and schumann gave us a finishing course in two specialties battle pieces and shipwrecks whatever i am in art i owe to these men i have something of the manner of each and all of them but they all said that i had also a manner of my own and that it was conspicuous they said there was a marked individuality about my style insomuch that if i ever painted the commonest type of a dog i should be sure to throw a something into the aspect of that dog which would keep him from being mistaken for the creation of any other artist secretly i wanted to believe all these kind sayings but i could not i was afraid that my masters partiality for me and pride in me biased their judgment so i resolved to make a test privately and unknown to any one i painted my great picture heidelberg castle illuminated my first really important work in oils and had it hung up in the midst of a wilderness of oil pictures in the art exhibition with no name attached to it to my great gratification it was instantly recognized as mine all the town flocked to see it and people even came from neighboring localities to visit it it made more stir than any other work in the exhibition but the most gratifying thing of all was that chance strangers passing through who had not heard of my picture were not only drawn to it as by a lodestone the moment they entered the gallery but always took it for a turner apparently nobody had ever done that there were ruined castles on the overhanging cliffs and crags all the way these were said to have their legends like those on the rhine and what was better still they had never been in print there was nothing in the books about that lovely region it had been neglected by the tourist it was virgin soil for the literary pioneer meantime the knapsacks the rough walking suits and the stout walking shoes which we had ordered were finished and brought to us a mrx and a young mrz had agreed to go with us we went around one evening and bade good by to our friends and afterward had a little farewell banquet at the hotel we got to bed early for we wanted to make an early start so as to take advantage of the cool of the morning we were out of bed at break of day feeling fresh and vigorous and took a hearty breakfast then plunged down through the leafy arcades of the castle grounds toward the town what a glorious summer morning it was and how the flowers did pour out their fragrance and how the birds did sing it was just the time for a tramp through the woods and mountains we were all dressed alike broad slouch hats to keep the sun off gray knapsacks blue army shirts blue overalls leathern gaiters buttoned tight from knee down to ankle high quarter coarse shoes snugly laced each man had an opera glass a canteen and a guide book case slung over his shoulder and carried an alpenstock in one hand and a sun umbrella in the other around our hats were wound many folds of soft white muslin with the ends hanging and flapping down our backs an idea brought from the orient and used by tourists all over europe harris carried the little watch like machine called a pedometer whose office is to keep count of a mans steps and tell how far he has walked everybody stopped to admire our costumes and give us a hearty pleasant march to you when we got downtown i found that we could go by rail to within five miles of heilbronn the train was just starting so we jumped aboard and went tearing away in splendid spirits it was agreed all around that we had done wisely because it would be just as enjoyable to walk down the neckar as up it and it could not be needful to walk both ways there were some nice german people in our compartment i got to talking some pretty private matters presently and harris became nervous so he nudged me and said speak in german these germans may understand english i did so it was well i did for it turned out that there was not a german in that party who did not understand english perfectly it is curious how widespread our language is in germany after a while some of those folks got out and a german gentleman and his two young daughters got in i spoke in german of one of the latter several times but without result finally she said ich verstehe nur deutch und englishe or words to that effect that is i dont understand any language but german and english and sure enough not only she but her father and sister spoke english so after that we had all the talk we wanted and we wanted a good deal for they were agreeable people they were greatly interested in our customs especially the alpenstocks for they had not seen any before they said that the neckar road was perfectly level so we must be going to switzerland or some other rugged country and asked us if we did not find the walking pretty fatiguing in such warm weather but we said no we reached wimpfen i think it was wimpfen in about three hours and got out not the least tired found a good hotel and ordered beer and dinner then took a stroll through the venerable old village it was very picturesque and tumble down and dirty and interesting it had queer houses five hundred years old in it and a military tower feet high which had stood there more than ten centuries i made a little sketch of it i kept a copy but gave the original to the burgomaster i think the original was better than the copy because it had more windows in it and the grass stood up better and had a brisker look there was none around the tower though i composed the grass myself from studies i made in a field by heidelberg in haemmerlings time the man on top looking at the view is apparently too large but i found he could not be made smaller conveniently i wanted him there and i wanted him visible so i thought out a way to manage it i composed the picture from two points of view the spectator is to observe the man from bout where that flag is and he must observe the tower itself from the ground this harmonizes the seeming discrepancy figure near an old cathedral under a shed were three crosses of stone moldy and damaged things bearing life size stone figures the two thieves were dressed in the fanciful court costumes of the middle of the sixteenth century while the saviour was nude with the exception of a cloth around the loins we had dinner under the green trees in a garden belonging to the hotel and overlooking the neckar then after a smoke we went to bed we had a refreshing nap then got up about three in the afternoon and put on our panoply as we tramped gaily out at the gate of the town we overtook a peasants cart partly laden with odds and ends of cabbages and similar vegetable rubbish and drawn by a small cow and a smaller donkey yoked together it was a pretty slow concern but it got us into heilbronn before dark five miles or possibly it was seven we stopped at the very same inn which the famous old robber knight and rough fighter goetz von berlichingen abode in after he got out of captivity in the square tower of heilbronn between three hundred and fifty and four hundred years ago harris and i occupied the same room which he had occupied and the same paper had not quite peeled off the walls yet the furniture was quaint old carved stuff full four hundred years old and some of the smells were over a thousand there was a hook in the wall which the landlord said the terrific old goetz used to hang his iron hand on when he took it off to go to bed this room was very large it might be called immense and it was on the first floor which means it was in the second story for in europe the houses are so high that they do not count the first story else they would get tired climbing before they got to the top the wallpaper was a fiery red with huge gold figures in it well smirched by time and it covered all the doors these doors fitted so snugly and continued the figures of the paper so unbrokenly that when they were closed one had to go feeling and searching along the wall to find them there was a stove in the corner one of those tall square stately white porcelain things that looks like a monument and keeps you thinking of death when you ought to be enjoying your travels the windows looked out on a little alley and over that into a stable and some poultry and pig yards in the rear of some tenement houses there were the customary two beds in the room one in one end the other in the other about an old fashioned brass mounted single barreled pistol shot apart they were fully as narrow as the usual german bed too and had the german beds ineradicable habit of spilling the blankets on the floor every time you forgot yourself and went to sleep a round table as large as king arthurs stood in the center of the room while the waiters were getting ready to serve our dinner on it we all went out to see the renowned clock on the front of the municipal buildings chapter xii what the wives saved the rathhaus or municipal building is of the quaintest and most picturesque middle age architecture it has a massive portico and steps before it heavily balustraded and adorned with life sized rusty iron knights in complete armor the clock face on the front of the building is very large and of curious pattern ordinarily a gilded angel strikes the hour on a big bell with a hammer as the striking ceases a life sized figure of time raises its hour glass and turns it two golden rams advance and butt each other a gilded cock lifts its wings but the main features are two great angels who stand on each side of the dial with long horns at their lips it was said that they blew melodious blasts on these horns every hour but they did not do it for us we were told later that they blew only at night when the town was still within the rathhaus were a number of huge wild boars heads preserved and mounted on brackets along the wall they bore inscriptions telling who killed them and how many hundred years ago it was done one room in the building was devoted to the preservation of ancient archives there they showed us no end of aged documents some were signed by popes some by tilly and other great generals and one was a letter written and subscribed by goetz von berlichingen in heilbronn in just after his release from the square tower this fine old robber knight was a devoutly and sincerely religious man hospitable charitable to the poor fearless in fight active enterprising and possessed of a large and generous nature he had in him a quality of being able to overlook moderate injuries and being able to forgive and forget mortal ones as soon as he had soundly trounced the authors of them he was prompt to take up any poor devils quarrel and risk his neck to right him the common folk held him dear and his memory is still green in ballad and tradition he used to go on the highway and rob rich wayfarers and other times he would swoop down from his high castle on the hills of the neckar and capture passing cargoes of merchandise in his memoirs he piously thanks the giver of all good for remembering him in his needs and delivering sundry such cargoes into his hands at times when only special providences could have relieved him he was a doughty warrior and found a deep joy in battle in an assault upon a stronghold in bavaria when he was only twenty three years old his right hand was shot away but he was so interested in the fight that he did not observe it for a while he said that the iron hand which was made for him afterward and which he wore for more than half a century was nearly as clever a member as the fleshy one had been i was glad to get a facsimile of the letter written by this fine old german robin hood though i was not able to read it he was a better artist with his sword than with his pen we went down by the river and saw the square tower it was a very venerable structure very strong and very ornamental there was no opening near the ground they had to use a ladder to get into it no doubt we visited the principal church also a curious old structure with a towerlike spire adorned with all sorts of grotesque images the inner walls of the church were placarded with large mural tablets of copper bearing engraved inscriptions celebrating the merits of old heilbronn worthies of two or three centuries ago and also bearing rudely painted effigies of themselves and their families tricked out in the queer costumes of those days the head of the family sat in the foreground and beyond him extended a sharply receding and diminishing row of sons facing him sat his wife and beyond her extended a low row of diminishing daughters the family was usually large but the perspective bad then we hired the hack and the horse which goetz von berlichingen used to use and drove several miles into the country to visit the place called weibertreu wifes fidelity i suppose it means it was a feudal castle of the middle ages when we reached its neighborhood we found it was beautifully situated but on top of a mound or hill round and tolerably steep and about two hundred feet high therefore as the sun was blazing hot we did not climb up there but took the place on trust and observed it from a distance while the horse leaned up against a fence and rested the place has no interest except that which is lent it by its legend which is a very pretty one to this effect the legend in the middle ages a couple of young dukes brothers took opposite sides in one of the wars the one fighting for the emperor the other against him one of them owned the castle and village on top of the mound which i have been speaking of and in his absence his brother came with his knights and soldiers and began a siege it was a long and tedious business for the people made a stubborn and faithful defense but at last their supplies ran out and starvation began its work more fell by hunger than by the missiles of the enemy they by and by surrendered and begged for charitable terms but the beleaguering prince was so incensed against them for their long resistance that he said he would spare none but the women and children all men should be put to the sword without exception and all their goods destroyed then the women came and fell on their knees and begged for the lives of their husbands no said the prince not a man of them shall escape alive you yourselves shall go with your children into houseless and friendless banishment but that you may not starve i grant you this one grace that each woman may bear with her from this place as much of her most valuable property as she is able to carry very well presently the gates swung open and out filed those women carrying their husbands on their shoulders the besiegers furious at the trick rushed forward to slaughter the men but the duke stepped between and said no put up your swords a princes word is inviolable when we got back to the hotel king arthurs round table was ready for us in its white drapery and the head waiter and his first assistant in swallow tails and white cravats brought in the soup and the hot plates at once mrx had ordered the dinner and when the wine came on he picked up a bottle glanced at the label and then turned to the grave the melancholy the sepulchral head waiter and said it was not the sort of wine he had asked for the head waiter picked up the bottle cast his undertaker eye on it and said it is true i beg pardon then he turned on his subordinate and calmly said bring another label at the same time he slid the present label off with his hand and laid it aside it had been newly put on its paste was still wet when the new label came he put it on our french wine being now turned into german wine according to desire the head waiter went blandly about his other duties as if the working of this sort of miracle was a common and easy thing to him mrx said he had not known before that there were people honest enough to do this miracle in public but he was aware that thousands upon thousands of labels were imported into america from europe every year to enable dealers to furnish to their customers in a quiet and inexpensive way all the different kinds of foreign wines they might require we took a turn around the town after dinner and found it fully as interesting in the moonlight as it had been in the daytime the streets were narrow and roughly paved and there was not a sidewalk or a street lamp anywhere the dwellings were centuries old and vast enough for hotels they widened all the way up the stories projected further and further forward and aside as they ascended and the long rows of lighted windows filled with little bits of panes curtained with figured white muslin and adorned outside with boxes of flowers made a pretty effect the moon was bright and the light and shadow very strong and nothing could be more picturesque than those curving streets with their rows of huge high gables leaning far over toward each other in a friendly gossiping way and the crowds below drifting through the alternating blots of gloom and mellow bars of moonlight nearly everybody was abroad chatting singing romping or massed in lazy comfortable attitudes in the doorways in one place there was a public building which was fenced about with a thick rusty chain which sagged from post to post in a succession of low swings the pavement here was made of heavy blocks of stone in the glare of the moon a party of barefooted children were swinging on those chains and having a noisy good time they were not the first ones who have done that even their great great grandfathers had not been the first to do it when they were children the strokes of the bare feet had worn grooves inches deep in the stone flags it had taken many generations of swinging children to accomplish that everywhere in the town were the mold and decay that go with antiquity and evidence of it but i do not know that anything else gave us so vivid a sense of the old age of heilbronn as those footworn grooves in the paving stones chapter xiii my long crawl in the dark when we got back to the hotel i wound and set the pedometer and put it in my pocket for i was to carry it next day and keep record of the miles we made the work which we had given the instrument to do during the day which had just closed had not fatigued it perceptibly we were in bed by ten for we wanted to be up and away on our tramp homeward with the dawn i hung fire but harris went to sleep at once i hate a man who goes to sleep at once there is a sort of indefinable something about it which is not exactly an insult and yet is an insolence and one which is hard to bear too i lay there fretting over this injury and trying to go to sleep but the harder i tried the wider awake i grew i got to feeling very lonely in the dark with no company but an undigested dinner my mind got a start by and by and began to consider the beginning of every subject which has ever been thought of but it never went further than the beginning it was touch and go it fled from topic to topic with a frantic speed at the end of an hour my head was in a perfect whirl and i was dead tired fagged out the fatigue was so great that it presently began to make some head against the nervous excitement while imagining myself wide awake i would really doze into momentary unconsciousness and come suddenly out of it with a physical jerk which nearly wrenched my joints apart the delusion of the instant being that i was tumbling backward over a precipice after i had fallen over eight or nine precipices and thus found out that one half of my brain had been asleep eight or nine times without the wide awake hard working other half suspecting it the periodical unconsciousnesses began to extend their spell gradually over more of my brain territory and at last i sank into a drowse which grew deeper and deeper and was doubtless just on the very point of being a solid blessed dreamless stupor when what was that my dulled faculties dragged themselves partly back to life and took a receptive attitude now out of an immense a limitless distance came a something which grew and grew and approached and presently was recognizable as a sound it had rather seemed to be a feeling before this sound was a mile away now perhaps it was the murmur of a storm and now it was nearer not a quarter of a mile away was it the muffled rasping and grinding of distant machinery no it came still nearer was it the measured tramp of a marching troop but it came nearer still and still nearer and at last it was right in the room it was merely a mouse gnawing the woodwork so i had held my breath all that time for such a trifle well what was done could not be helped i would go to sleep at once and make up the lost time that was a thoughtless thought without intending it hardly knowing it i fell to listening intently to that sound and even unconsciously counting the strokes of the mouses nutmeg grater presently i was deriving exquisite suffering from this employment yet maybe i could have endured it if the mouse had attended steadily to his work but he did not do that he stopped every now and then and i suffered more while waiting and listening for him to begin again than i did while he was gnawing along at first i was mentally offering a reward of five six seven ten dollars for that mouse but toward the last i was offering rewards which were entirely beyond my means i close reefed my ears that is to say i bent the flaps of them down and furled them into five or six folds and pressed them against the hearing orifice but it did no good the faculty was so sharpened by nervous excitement that it was become a microphone and could hear through the overlays without trouble my anger grew to a frenzy i finally did what all persons before me have done clear back to adam resolved to throw something i reached down and got my walking shoes then sat up in bed and listened in order to exactly locate the noise but i couldnt do it it was as unlocatable as a crickets noise and where one thinks that that is is always the very place where it isnt so i presently hurled a shoe at random and with a vicious vigor it struck the wall over harriss head and fell down on him i had not imagined i could throw so far it woke harris and i was glad of it until i found he was not angry then i was sorry he soon went to sleep again which pleased me but straightway the mouse began again which roused my temper once more i did not want to wake harris a second time but the gnawing continued until i was compelled to throw the other shoe this time i broke a mirror there were two in the room i got the largest one of course harris woke again but did not complain and i was sorrier than ever i resolved that i would suffer all possible torture before i would disturb him a third time the mouse eventually retired and by and by i was sinking to sleep when a clock began to strike i counted till it was done and was about to drowse again when another clock began i counted then the two great rathhaus clock angels began to send forth soft rich melodious blasts from their long trumpets i had never heard anything that was so lovely or weird or mysterious but when they got to blowing the quarter hours they seemed to me to be overdoing the thing every time i dropped off for the moment a new noise woke me each time i woke i missed my coverlet and had to reach down to the floor and get it again at last all sleepiness forsook me i recognized the fact that i was hopelessly and permanently wide awake wide awake and feverish and thirsty when i had lain tossing there as long as i could endure it it occurred to me that it would be a good idea to dress and go out in the great square and take a refreshing wash in the fountain and smoke and reflect there until the remnant of the night was gone i believed i could dress in the dark without waking harris i had banished my shoes after the mouse but my slippers would do for a summer night so i rose softly and gradually got on everything down to one sock i couldnt seem to get on the track of that sock any way i could fix it but i had to have it so i went down on my hands and knees with one slipper on and the other in my hand and began to paw gently around and rake the floor but with no success i enlarged my circle and went on pawing and raking with every pressure of my knee how the floor creaked and every time i chanced to rake against any article it seemed to give out thirty five or thirty six times more noise than it would have done in the daytime in those cases i always stopped and held my breath till i was sure harris had not awakened then i crept along again i moved on and on but i could not find the sock i could not seem to find anything but furniture i could not remember that there was much furniture in the room when i went to bed but the place was alive with it now especially chairs chairs everywhere had a couple of families moved in in the mean time and i never could seem to glance on one of those chairs but always struck it full and square with my head my temper rose by steady and sure degrees and as i pawed on and on i fell to making vicious comments under my breath finally with a venomous access of irritation i said i would leave without the sock so i rose up and made straight for the door as i supposed and suddenly confronted my dim spectral image in the unbroken mirror it startled the breath out of me for an instant it also showed me that i was lost and had no sort of idea where i was when i realized this i was so angry that i had to sit down on the floor and take hold of something to keep from lifting the roof off with an explosion of opinion if there had been only one mirror it might possibly have helped to locate me but there were two and two were as bad as a thousand besides these were on opposite sides of the room i could see the dim blur of the windows but in my turned around condition they were exactly where they ought not to be and so they only confused me instead of helping me i started to get up and knocked down an umbrella it made a noise like a pistol shot when it struck that hard slick carpetless floor i grated my teeth and held my breath harris did not stir i set the umbrella slowly and carefully on end against the wall but as soon as i took my hand away its heel slipped from under it and down it came again with another bang i shrunk together and listened a moment in silent fury no harm done everything quiet with the most painstaking care and nicety i stood the umbrella up once more took my hand away and down it came again i have been strictly reared but if it had not been so dark and solemn and awful there in that lonely vast room i do believe i should have said something then which could not be put into a sunday school book without injuring the sale of it if my reasoning powers had not been already sapped dry by my harassments i would have known better than to try to set an umbrella on end on one of those glassy german floors in the dark it cant be done in the daytime without four failures to one success i had one comfort though harris was yet still and silent he had not stirred the umbrella could not locate me there were four standing around the room and all alike i thought i would feel along the wall and find the door in that way i rose up and began this operation but raked down a picture it was not a large one but it made noise enough for a panorama harris gave out no sound but i felt that if i experimented any further with the pictures i should be sure to wake him better give up trying to get out yes i would find king arthurs round table once more i had already found it several times and use it for a base of departure on an exploring tour for my bed if i could find my bed i could then find my water pitcher i would quench my raging thirst and turn in so i started on my hands and knees because i could go faster that way and with more confidence too and not knock down things by and by i found the table with my head rubbed the bruise a little then rose up and started with hands abroad and fingers spread to balance myself i found a chair then a wall then another chair then a sofa then an alpenstock then another sofa this confounded me for i had thought there was only one sofa i hunted up the table again and took a fresh start found some more chairs it occurred to me now as it ought to have done before that as the table was round it was therefore of no value as a base to aim from so i moved off once more and at random among the wilderness of chairs and sofas wandering off into unfamiliar regions and presently knocked a candlestick and knocked off a lamp grabbed at the lamp and knocked off a water pitcher with a rattling crash and thought to myself i ve found you at last i judged i was close upon you harris shouted murder and thieves and finished with im absolutely drowned the crash had roused the house mrx pranced in in his long night garment with a candle young z after him with another candle a procession swept in at another door with candles and lanterns landlord and two german guests in their nightgowns and a chambermaid in hers i looked around i was at harriss bed a sabbath days journey from my own there was only one sofa it was against the wall there was only one chair where a body could get at it i had been revolving around it like a planet and colliding with it like a comet half the night i explained how i had been employing myself and why then the landlords party left and the rest of us set about our preparations for breakfast for the dawn was ready to break i glanced furtively at my pedometer and found i had made miles but i did not care for i had come out for a pedestrian tour anyway chapter xiv rafting down the neckar when the landlord learned that i and my agents were artists our party rose perceptibly in his esteem we rose still higher when he learned that we were making a pedestrian tour of europe he told us all about the heidelberg road and which were the best places to avoid and which the best ones to tarry at he charged me less than cost for the things i broke in the night he put up a fine luncheon for us and added to it a quantity of great light green plums the pleasantest fruit in germany he was so anxious to do us honor that he would not allow us to walk out of heilbronn but called up goetz von berlichingens horse and cab and made us ride i made a sketch of the turnout it is not a work it is only what artists call a study a thing to make a finished picture from this sketch has several blemishes in it for instance the wagon is not traveling as fast as the horse is this is wrong again the person trying to get out of the way is too small he is out of perspective as we say the two upper lines are not the horses back they are the reigns there seems to be a wheel missing this would be corrected in a finished work of course this thing flying out behind is not a flag it is a curtain that other thing up there is the sun but i didnt get enough distance on it i do not remember now what that thing is that is in front of the man who is running but i think it is a haystack or a woman this study was exhibited in the paris salon of but did not take any medal they do not give medals for studies we discharged the carriage at the bridge the river was full of logs long slender barkless pine logs and we leaned on the rails of the bridge and watched the men put them together into rafts these rafts were of a shape and construction to suit the crookedness and extreme narrowness of the neckar they were from fifty to one hundred yards long and they gradually tapered from a nine log breadth at their sterns to a three log breadth at their bow ends the main part of the steering is done at the bow with a pole the three log breadth there furnishes room for only the steersman for these little logs are not larger around than an average young ladys waist the connections of the several sections of the raft are slack and pliant so that the raft may be readily bent into any sort of curve required by the shape of the river the neckar is in many places so narrow that a person can throw a dog across it if he has one when it is also sharply curved in such places the raftsman has to do some pretty nice snug piloting to make the turns the river is not always allowed to spread over its whole bed which is as much as thirty and sometimes forty yards wide but is split into three equal bodies of water by stone dikes which throw the main volume depth and current into the central one in low water these neat narrow edged dikes project four or five inches above the surface like the comb of a submerged roof but in high water they are overflowed a hatful of rain makes high water in the neckar and a basketful produces an overflow there are dikes abreast the schloss hotel and the current is violently swift at that point i used to sit for hours in my glass cage watching the long narrow rafts slip along through the central channel grazing the right bank dike and aiming carefully for the middle arch of the stone bridge below i watched them in this way and lost all this time hoping to see one of them hit the bridge pier and wreck itself sometime or other but was always disappointed one was smashed there one morning but i had just stepped into my room a moment to light a pipe so i lost it while i was looking down upon the rafts that morning in heilbronn the daredevil spirit of adventure came suddenly upon me and i said to my comrades i am going to heidelberg on a raft will you venture with me their faces paled a little but they assented with as good a grace as they could harris wanted to cable his mother thought it his duty to do that as he was all she had in this world so while he attended to this i went down to the longest and finest raft and hailed the captain with a hearty ahoy shipmate which put us upon pleasant terms at once and we entered upon business i said we were on a pedestrian tour to heidelberg and would like to take passage with him i said this partly through young z who spoke german very well and partly through mrx who spoke it peculiarly i can understand german as well as the maniac that invented it but i talk it best through an interpreter the captain hitched up his trousers then shifted his quid thoughtfully presently he said just what i was expecting he would say that he had no license to carry passengers and therefore was afraid the law would be after him in case the matter got noised about or any accident happened so i chartered the raft and the crew and took all the responsibilities on myself with a rattling song the starboard watch bent to their work and hove the cable short then got the anchor home and our bark moved off with a stately stride and soon was bowling along at about two knots an hour our party were grouped amidships at first the talk was a little gloomy and ran mainly upon the shortness of life the uncertainty of it the perils which beset it and the need and wisdom of being always prepared for the worst this shaded off into low voiced references to the dangers of the deep and kindred matters but as the gray east began to redden and the mysterious solemnity and silence of the dawn to give place to the joy songs of the birds the talk took a cheerier tone and our spirits began to rise steadily germany in the summer is the perfection of the beautiful but nobody has understood and realized and enjoyed the utmost possibilities of this soft and peaceful beauty unless he has voyaged down the neckar on a raft the motion of a raft is the needful motion it is gentle and gliding and smooth and noiseless it calms down all feverish activities it soothes to sleep all nervous hurry and impatience under its restful influence all the troubles and vexations and sorrows that harass the mind vanish away and existence becomes a dream a charm a deep and tranquil ecstasy how it contrasts with hot and perspiring pedestrianism and dusty and deafening railroad rush and tedious jolting behind tired horses over blinding white roads we went slipping silently along between the green and fragrant banks with a sense of pleasure and contentment that grew and grew all the time sometimes the banks were overhung with thick masses of willows that wholly hid the ground behind sometimes we had noble hills on one hand clothed densely with foliage to their tops and on the other hand open levels blazing with poppies or clothed in the rich blue of the corn flower sometimes we drifted in the shadow of forests and sometimes along the margin of long stretches of velvety grass fresh and green and bright a tireless charm to the eye and the birds they were everywhere they swept back and forth across the river constantly and their jubilant music was never stilled it was a deep and satisfying pleasure to see the sun create the new morning and gradually patiently lovingly clothe it on with splendor after splendor and glory after glory till the miracle was complete how different is this marvel observed from a raft from what it is when one observes it through the dingy windows of a railway station in some wretched village while he munches a petrified sandwich and waits for the train a tramp abroad part by mark

time the people often stepped aboard the raft as we glided along the grassy shores and gossiped with us and with the crew for a hundred yards or so then stepped ashore again refreshed by the ride only the men did this the women were too busy the women do all kinds of work on the continent they dig they hoe they reap they sow they bear monstrous burdens on their backs they shove similar ones long distances on wheelbarrows they drag the cart when there is no dog or lean cow to drag it and when there is they assist the dog or cow age is no matter the older the woman the stronger she is apparently on the farm a womans duties are not defined she does a little of everything but in the towns it is different there she only does certain things the men do the rest for instance a hotel chambermaid has nothing to do but make beds and fires in fifty or sixty rooms bring towels and candles and fetch several tons of water up several flights of stairs a hundred pounds at a time in prodigious metal pitchers she does not have to work more than eighteen or twenty hours a day and she can always get down on her knees and scrub the floors of halls and closets when she is tired and needs a rest as the morning advanced and the weather grew hot we took off our outside clothing and sat in a row along the edge of the raft and enjoyed the scenery with our sun umbrellas over our heads and our legs dangling in the water every now and then we plunged in and had a swim every projecting grassy cape had its joyous group of naked children the boys to themselves and the girls to themselves the latter usually in care of some motherly dame who sat in the shade of a tree with her knitting the little boys swam out to us sometimes but the little maids stood knee deep in the water and stopped their splashing and frolicking to inspect the raft with their innocent eyes as it drifted by once we turned a corner suddenly and surprised a slender girl of twelve years or upward just stepping into the water she had not time to run but she did what answered just as well she promptly drew a lithe young willow bough athwart her white body with one hand and then contemplated us with a simple and untroubled interest thus she stood while we glided by she was a pretty creature and she and her willow bough made a very pretty picture and one which could not offend the modesty of the most fastidious spectator her white skin had a low bank of fresh green willows for background and effective contrast for she stood against them and above and out of them projected the eager faces and white shoulders of two smaller girls toward noon we heard the inspiriting cry sail ho where away shouted the captain three points off the weather bow we ran forward to see the vessel it proved to be a steamboat for they had begun to run a steamer up the neckar for the first time in may she was a tug and one of a very peculiar build and aspect i had often watched her from the hotel and wondered how she propelled herself for apparently she had no propeller or paddles she came churning along now making a deal of noise of one kind or another and aggravating it every now and then by blowing a hoarse whistle she had nine keel boats hitched on behind and following after her in a long slender rank we met her in a narrow place between dikes and there was hardly room for us both in the cramped passage as she went grinding and groaning by we perceived the secret of her moving impulse she did not drive herself up the river with paddles or propeller she pulled herself by hauling on a great chain this chain is laid in the bed of the river and is only fastened at the two ends it is seventy miles long it comes in over the boats bow passes around a drum and is payed out astern she pulls on that chain and so drags herself up the river or down it she has neither bow or stern strictly speaking for she has a long bladed rudder on each end and she never turns around she uses both rudders all the time and they are powerful enough to enable her to turn to the right or the left and steer around curves in spite of the strong resistance of the chain i would not have believed that that impossible thing could be done but i saw it done and therefore i know that there is one impossible thing which can be done what miracle will man attempt next we met many big keel boats on their way up using sails mule power and profanity a tedious and laborious business a wire rope led from the foretopmast to the file of mules on the tow path a hundred yards ahead and by dint of much banging and swearing and urging the detachment of drivers managed to get a speed of two or three miles an hour out of the mules against the stiff current the neckar has always been used as a canal and thus has given employment to a great many men and animals but now that this steamboat is able with a small crew and a bushel or so of coal to take nine keel boats farther up the river in one hour than thirty men and thirty mules can do it in two it is believed that the old fashioned towing industry is on its death bed a second steamboat began work in the neckar three months after the first one was put in service figure at noon we stepped ashore and bought some bottled beer and got some chickens cooked while the raft waited then we immediately put to sea again and had our dinner while the beer was cold and the chickens hot there is no pleasanter place for such a meal than a raft that is gliding down the winding neckar past green meadows and wooded hills and slumbering villages and craggy heights graced with crumbling towers and battlements in one place we saw a nicely dressed german gentleman without any spectacles before i could come to anchor he had got underway it was a great pity i so wanted to make a sketch of him the captain comforted me for my loss however by saying that the man was without any doubt a fraud who had spectacles but kept them in his pocket in order to make himself conspicuous below hassmersheim we passed hornberg goetz von berlichingens old castle it stands on a bold elevation two hundred feet above the surface of the river it has high vine clad walls enclosing trees and a peaked tower about seventy five feet high the steep hillside from the castle clear down to the waters edge is terraced and clothed thick with grape vines this is like farming a mansard roof all the steeps along that part of the river which furnish the proper exposure are given up to the grape that region is a great producer of rhine wines the germans are exceedingly fond of rhine wines they are put up in tall slender bottles and are considered a pleasant beverage one tells them from vinegar by the label the hornberg hill is to be tunneled and the new railway will pass under the castle the cave of the specter two miles below hornberg castle is a cave in a low cliff which the captain of the raft said had once been occupied by a beautiful heiress of hornberg the lady gertrude in the old times it was seven hundred years ago she had a number of rich and noble lovers and one poor and obscure one sir wendel lobenfeld with the native chuckleheadedness of the heroine of romance she preferred the poor and obscure lover with the native sound judgment of the father of a heroine of romance the von berlichingen of that day shut his daughter up in his donjon keep or his oubliette or his culverin or some such place and resolved that she should stay there until she selected a husband from among her rich and noble lovers the latter visited her and persecuted her with their supplications but without effect for her heart was true to her poor despised crusader who was fighting in the holy land finally she resolved that she would endure the attentions of the rich lovers no longer so one stormy night she escaped and went down the river and hid herself in the cave on the other side her father ransacked the country for her but found not a trace of her as the days went by and still no tidings of her came his conscience began to torture him and he caused proclamation to be made that if she were yet living and would return he would oppose her no longer she might marry whom she would the months dragged on all hope forsook the old man he ceased from his customary pursuits and pleasures he devoted himself to pious works and longed for the deliverance of death now just at midnight every night the lost heiress stood in the mouth of her cave arrayed in white robes and sang a little love ballad which her crusader had made for her she judged that if he came home alive the superstitious peasants would tell him about the ghost that sang in the cave and that as soon as they described the ballad he would know that none but he and she knew that song therefore he would suspect that she was alive and would come and find her as time went on the people of the region became sorely distressed about the specter of the haunted cave it was said that ill luck of one kind or another always overtook any one who had the misfortune to hear that song eventually every calamity that happened thereabouts was laid at the door of that music consequently no boatmen would consent to pass the cave at night the peasants shunned the place even in the daytime but the faithful girl sang on night after night month after month and patiently waited her reward must come at last five years dragged by and still every night at midnight the plaintive tones floated out over the silent land while the distant boatmen and peasants thrust their fingers into their ears and shuddered out a prayer and now came the crusader home bronzed and battle scarred but bringing a great and splendid fame to lay at the feet of his bride the old lord of hornberg received him as his son and wanted him to stay by him and be the comfort and blessing of his age but the tale of that young girls devotion to him and its pathetic consequences made a changed man of the knight he could not enjoy his well earned rest he said his heart was broken he would give the remnant of his life to high deeds in the cause of humanity and so find a worthy death and a blessed reunion with the brave true heart whose love had more honored him than all his victories in war when the people heard this resolve of his they came and told him there was a pitiless dragon in human disguise in the haunted cave a dread creature which no knight had yet been bold enough to face and begged him to rid the land of its desolating presence he said he would do it they told him about the song and when he asked what song it was they said the memory of it was gone for nobody had been hardy enough to listen to it for the past four years and more toward midnight the crusader came floating down the river in a boat with his trusty cross bow in his hands he drifted silently through the dim reflections of the crags and trees with his intent eyes fixed upon the low cliff which he was approaching as he drew nearer he discerned the black mouth of the cave now is that a white figure yes the plaintive song begins to well forth and float away over meadow and river the cross bow is slowly raised to position a steady aim is taken the bolt flies straight to the mark the figure sinks down still singing the knight takes the wool out of his ears and recognizes the old ballad too late ah if he had only not put the wool in his ears the crusader went away to the wars again and presently fell in battle fighting for the cross tradition says that during several centuries the spirit of the unfortunate girl sang nightly from the cave at midnight but the music carried no curse with it and although many listened for the mysterious sounds few were favored since only those could hear them who had never failed in a trust it is believed that the singing still continues but it is known that nobody has heard it during the present century chapter xvi an ancient legend of the rhine the lorelei the last legend reminds one of the lorelei a legend of the rhine there is a song called the lorelei germany is rich in folk songs and the words and airs of several of them are peculiarly beautiful but the lorelei is the peoples favorite i could not endure it at first but by and by it began to take hold of me and now there is no tune which i like so well it is not possible that it is much known in america else i should have heard it there the fact that i never heard it there is evidence that there are others in my country who have fared likewise therefore for the sake of these i mean to print the words and music in this chapter and i will refresh the readers memory by printing the legend of the lorelei too i have it by me in the legends of the rhine done into english by the wildly gifted garnham bachelor of arts i print the legend partly to refresh my own memory too for i have never read it before the legend lore two syllables was a water nymph who used to sit on a high rock called the ley or lei pronounced like our word lie in the rhine and lure boatmen to destruction in a furious rapid which marred the channel at that spot she so bewitched them with her plaintive songs and her wonderful beauty that they forgot everything else to gaze up at her and so they presently drifted among the broken reefs and were lost in those old old times the count bruno lived in a great castle near there with his son the count hermann a youth of twenty hermann had heard a great deal about the beautiful lore and had finally fallen very deeply in love with her without having seen her so he used to wander to the neighborhood of the lei evenings with his zither and express his longing in low singing as garnham says on one of these occasions suddenly there hovered around the top of the rock a brightness of unequaled clearness and color which in increasingly smaller circles thickened was the enchanting figure of the beautiful lore an unintentional cry of joy escaped the youth he let his zither fall and with extended arms he called out the name of the enigmatical being who seemed to stoop lovingly to him and beckon to him in a friendly manner indeed if his ear did not deceive him she called his name with unutterable sweet whispers proper to love beside himself with delight the youth lost his senses and sank senseless to the earth after that he was a changed person he went dreaming about thinking only of his fairy and caring for naught else in the world the old count saw with affliction this changement in his son whose cause he could not divine and tried to divert his mind into cheerful channels but to no purpose then the old count used authority he commanded the youth to betake himself to the camp obedience was promised garnham says it was on the evening before his departure as he wished still once to visit the lei and offer to the nymph of the rhine his sighs the tones of his zither and his songs he went in his boat this time accompanied by a faithful squire down the stream the moon shed her silvery light over the whole country the steep bank mountains appeared in the most fantastical shapes and the high oaks on either side bowed their branches on hermanns passing as soon as he approached the lei and was aware of the surf waves his attendant was seized with an inexpressible anxiety and he begged permission to land but the knight swept the strings of his guitar and sang once i saw thee in dark night in supernatural beauty bright of light rays was the figure wove to share its light locked hair strove thy garment color wave dove by thy hand the sign of love thy eyes sweet enchantment raying to me oh enchantment o wert thou but my sweetheart how willingly thy love to part with delight i should be bound to thy rocky house in deep ground that hermann should have gone to that place at all was not wise that he should have gone with such a song as that in his mouth was a most serious mistake the lorelei did not call his name in unutterable sweet whispers this time no that song naturally worked an instant and thorough changement in her and not only that but it stirred the bowels of the whole afflicted region around about there for scarcely had these tones sounded everywhere there began tumult and sound as if voices above and below the water on the lei rose flames the fairy stood above at that time and beckoned with her right hand clearly and urgently to the infatuated knight while with a staff in her left hand she called the waves to her service they began to mount heavenward the boat was upset mocking every exertion the waves rose to the gunwale and splitting on the hard stones the boat broke into pieces the youth sank into the depths but the squire was thrown on shore by a powerful wave the bitterest things have been said about the lorelei during many centuries but surely her conduct upon this occasion entitles her to our respect one feels drawn tenderly toward her and is moved to forget her many crimes and remember only the good deed that crowned and closed her career the fairy was never more seen but her enchanting tones have often been heard in the beautiful refreshing still nights of spring when the moon pours her silver light over the country the listening shipper hears from the rushing of the waves the echoing clang of a wonderfully charming voice which sings a song from the crystal castle and with sorrow and fear he thinks on the young count hermann seduced by the nymph here is the music and the german words by heinrich heine this song has been a favorite in germany for forty years and will remain a favorite always maybe figure i have a prejudice against people who print things in a foreign language and add no translation when i am the reader and the author considers me able to do the translating myself he pays me quite a nice compliment but if he would do the translating for me i would try to get along without the compliment if i were at home no doubt i could get a translation of this poem but i am abroad and cant therefore i will make a translation myself it may not be a good one for poetry is out of my line but it will serve my purpose which is to give the ungerman young girl a jingle of words to hang the tune on until she can get hold of a good version made by some one who is a poet and knows how to convey a poetical thought from one language to another the lorelei i cannot divine what it meaneth this haunting nameless pain a tale of the bygone ages keeps brooding through my brain the faint air cools in the glooming and peaceful flows the rhine the thirsty summits are drinking the sunsets flooding wine the loveliest maiden is sitting high throned in yon blue air her golden jewels are shining she combs her golden hair she combs with a comb that is golden and sings a weird refrain that steeps in a deadly enchantment the list ners ravished brain the doomed in his drifting shallop is tranced with the sad sweet tone he sees not the yawning breakers he sees but the maid alone the pitiless billows engulf him so perish sailor and bark and this with her baleful singing is the loreleis gruesome work i have a translation by garnham bachelor of arts in the legends of the rhine but it would not answer the purpose i mentioned above because the measure is too nobly irregular it dont fit the tune snugly enough in places it hangs over at the ends too far and in other places one runs out of words before he gets to the end of a bar still garnhams translation has high merits and i am not dreaming of leaving it out of my book i believe this poet is wholly unknown in america and england i take peculiar pleasure in bringing him forward because i consider that i discovered him the lorelei translated by lw garnhamb a i do not know what it signifies that i am so sorrowful a fable of old times so terrifies leaves my heart so thoughtful the air is cool and it darkens and calmly flows the rhine the summit of the mountain hearkens in evening sunshine line the most beautiful maiden entrances above wonderfully there her beautiful golden attire glances she combs her golden hair with golden comb so lustrous and thereby a song sings it has a tone so wondrous that powerful melody rings the shipper in the little ship it effects with woe sad might he does not see the rocky slip he only regards dreaded height i believe the turbulent waves swallow the last shipper and boat she with her singing craves all to visit hermagic moat no translation could be closer he has got in all the facts and in their regular order too there is not a statistic wanting it is as succinct as an invoice that is what a translation ought to be it should exactly reflect the thought of the original you cant sing above wonderfully there because it simply wont go to the tune without damaging the singer but it is a most clingingly exact translation of dort oben wunderbar fits it like a blister mr garnhams reproduction has other merits a hundred of them but it is not necessary to point them out they will be detected no one with a specialty can hope to have a monopoly of it even garnham has a rival mrx had a small pamphlet with him which he had bought while on a visit to munich it was entitled a catalogue of pictures in the old pinacotek and was written in a peculiar kind of english here are a few extracts it is not permitted to make use of the work in question to a publication of the same

a mile or two above eberbach we saw a peculiar ruin projecting above the foliage which clothed the peak of a high and very steep hill this ruin consisted of merely a couple of crumbling masses of masonry which bore a rude resemblance to human faces they leaned forward and touched foreheads and had the look of being absorbed in conversation this ruin had nothing very imposing or picturesque about it and there was no great deal of it yet it was called the spectacular ruin legend of the spectacular ruin the captain of the raft who was as full of history as he could stick said that in the middle ages a most prodigious fire breathing dragon used to live in that region and made more trouble than a tax collector he was as long as a railway train and had the customary impenetrable green scales all over him his breath bred pestilence and conflagration and his appetite bred famine he ate men and cattle impartially and was exceedingly unpopular the german emperor of that day made the usual offer he would grant to the destroyer of the dragon any one solitary thing he might ask for for he had a surplusage of daughters and it was customary for dragon killers to take a daughter for pay so the most renowned knights came from the four corners of the earth and retired down the dragons throat one after the other a panic arose and spread heroes grew cautious the procession ceased the dragon became more destructive than ever the people lost all hope of succor and fled to the mountains for refuge at last sir wissenschaft a poor and obscure knight out of a far country arrived to do battle with the monster a pitiable object he was with his armor hanging in rags about him and his strange shaped knapsack strapped upon his back everybody turned up their noses at him and some openly jeered him but he was calm he simply inquired if the emperors offer was still in force the emperor said it was but charitably advised him to go and hunt hares and not endanger so precious a life as his in an attempt which had brought death to so many of the worlds most illustrious heroes but this tramp only asked were any of these heroes men of science this raised a laugh of course for science was despised in those days but the tramp was not in the least ruffled he said he might be a little in advance of his age but no matter science would come to be honored some time or other he said he would march against the dragon in the morning out of compassion then a decent spear was offered him but he declined and said spears were useless to men of science they allowed him to sup in the servants hall and gave him a bed in the stables when he started forth in the morning thousands were gathered to see the emperor said do not be rash take a spear and leave off your knapsack but the tramp said it is not a knapsack and moved straight on the dragon was waiting and ready he was breathing forth vast volumes of sulphurous smoke and lurid blasts of flame the ragged knight stole warily to a good position then he unslung his cylindrical knapsack which was simply the common fire extinguisher known to modern times and the first chance he got he turned on his hose and shot the dragon square in the center of his cavernous mouth out went the fires in an instant and the dragon curled up and died this man had brought brains to his aid he had reared dragons from the egg in his laboratory he had watched over them like a mother and patiently studied them and experimented upon them while they grew thus he had found out that fire was the life principle of a dragon put out the dragons fires and it could make steam no longer and must die he could not put out a fire with a spear therefore he invented the extinguisher the dragon being dead the emperor fell on the heros neck and said deliverer name your request at the same time beckoning out behind with his heel for a detachment of his daughters to form and advance but the tramp gave them no observance he simply said my request is that upon me be conferred the monopoly of the manufacture and sale of spectacles in germany the emperor sprang aside and exclaimed this transcends all the impudence i ever heard a modest demand by my halidome why didnt you ask for the imperial revenues at once and be done with it but the monarch had given his word and he kept it to everybodys surprise the unselfish monopolist immediately reduced the price of spectacles to such a degree that a great and crushing burden was removed from the nation the emperor to commemorate this generous act and to testify his appreciation of it issued a decree commanding everybody to buy this benefactors spectacles and wear them whether they needed them or not so originated the wide spread custom of wearing spectacles in germany and as a custom once established in these old lands is imperishable this one remains universal in the empire to this day such is the legend of the monopolists once stately and sumptuous castle now called the spectacular ruin on the right bank two or three miles below the spectacular ruin we passed by a noble pile of castellated buildings overlooking the water from the crest of a lofty elevation a stretch of two hundred yards of the high front wall was heavily draped with ivy and out of the mass of buildings within rose three picturesque old towers the place was in fine order and was inhabited by a family of princely rank this castle had its legend too but i should not feel justified in repeating it because i doubted the truth of some of its minor details along in this region a multitude of italian laborers were blasting away the frontage of the hills to make room for the new railway they were fifty or a hundred feet above the river as we turned a sharp corner they began to wave signals and shout warnings to us to look out for the explosions it was all very well to warn us but what could we do you cant back a raft upstream you cant hurry it downstream you cant scatter out to one side when you havent any room to speak of you wont take to the perpendicular cliffs on the other shore when they appear to be blasting there too your resources are limited you see there is simply nothing for it but to watch and pray for some hours we had been making three and a half or four miles an hour and we were still making that we had been dancing right along until those men began to shout then for the next ten minutes it seemed to me that i had never seen a raft go so slowly when the first blast went off we raised our sun umbrellas and waited for the result no harm done none of the stones fell in the water another blast followed and another and another some of the rubbish fell in the water just astern of us we ran that whole battery of nine blasts in a row and it was certainly one of the most exciting and uncomfortable weeks i ever spent either aship or ashore of course we frequently manned the poles and shoved earnestly for a second or so but every time one of those spurts of dust and debris shot aloft every man dropped his pole and looked up to get the bearings of his share of it it was very busy times along there for a while it appeared certain that we must perish but even that was not the bitterest thought no the abjectly unheroic nature of the death that was the sting that and the bizarre wording of the resulting obituary shot with a rock on a raft there would be no poetry written about it none could be written about it example not by wars shock or wars shaft shot with a rock on a raft no poet who valued his reputation would touch such a theme as that i should be distinguished as the only distinguished dead who went down to the grave unsonneted in but we escaped and i have never regretted it the last blast was a peculiarly strong one and after the small rubbish was done raining around us and we were just going to shake hands over our deliverance a later and larger stone came down amongst our little group of pedestrians and wrecked an umbrella it did no other harm but we took to the water just the same it seems that the heavy work in the quarries and the new railway gradings is done mainly by italians that was a revelation we have the notion in our country that italians never do heavy work at all but confine themselves to the lighter arts like organ grinding operatic singing and assassination we have blundered that is plain all along the river near every village we saw little station houses for the future railway they were finished and waiting for the rails and business they were as trim and snug and pretty as they could be they were always of brick or stone they were of graceful shape they had vines and flowers about them already and around them the grass was bright and green and showed that it was carefully looked after they were a decoration to the beautiful landscape not an offense wherever one saw a pile of gravel or a pile of broken stone it was always heaped as trimly and exactly as a new grave or a stack of cannon balls nothing about those stations or along the railroad or the wagon road was allowed to look shabby or be unornamental the keeping a country in such beautiful order as germany exhibits has a wise practical side to it too for it keeps thousands of people in work and bread who would otherwise be idle and mischievous as the night shut down the captain wanted to tie up but i thought maybe we might make hirschhorn so we went on presently the sky became overcast and the captain came aft looking uneasy he cast his eye aloft then shook his head and said it was coming on to blow my party wanted to land at once therefore i wanted to go on the captain said we ought to shorten sail anyway out of common prudence consequently the larboard watch was ordered to lay in his pole it grew quite dark now and the wind began to rise it wailed through the swaying branches of the trees and swept our decks in fitful gusts things were taking on an ugly look the captain shouted to the steersman on the forward log hows she landing the answer came faint and hoarse from far forward nor east and by nor east by east half east sir let her go off a point aye aye sir what water have you got shoal sir two foot large on the stabboard two and a half scant on the labboard let her go off another point aye aye sir forward men all of you lively now stand by to crowd her round the weather corner aye aye sir then followed a wild running and trampling and hoarse shouting but the forms of the men were lost in the darkness and the sounds were distorted and confused by the roaring of the wind through the shingle bundles by this time the sea was running inches high and threatening every moment to engulf the frail bark now came the mate hurrying aft and said close to the captains ear in a low agitated voice prepare for the worst sir we have sprung a leak heavens where right aft the second row of logs nothing but a miracle can save us dont let the men know or there will be a panic and mutiny lay her in shore and stand by to jump with the stern line the moment she touches gentlemen i must look to you to second my endeavors in this hour of peril you have hats go forward and bail for your lives down swept another mighty blast of wind clothed in spray and thick darkness at such a moment as this came from away forward that most appalling of all cries that are ever heard at sea man overboard the captain shouted hard a port never mind the man let him climb aboard or wade ashore another cry came down the wind breakers ahead where away not a logs length off her port fore foot we had groped our slippery way forward and were now bailing with the frenzy of despair when we heard the mates terrified cry from far aft stop that dashed bailing or we shall be aground but this was immediately followed by the glad shout land aboard the starboard transom saved cried the captain jump ashore and take a turn around a tree and pass the bight aboard the next moment we were all on shore weeping and embracing for joy while the rain poured down in torrents the captain said he had been a mariner for forty years on the neckar and in that time had seen storms to make a mans cheek blanch and his pulses stop but he had never never seen a storm that even approached this one how familiar that sounded for i have been at sea a good deal and have heard that remark from captains with a frequency accordingly we framed in our minds the usual resolution of thanks and admiration and gratitude and took the first opportunity to vote it and put it in writing and present it to the captain with the customary speech we tramped through the darkness and the drenching summer rain full three miles and reached the naturalist tavern in the village of hirschhorn just an hour before midnight almost exhausted from hardship fatigue and terror i can never forget that night the landlord was rich and therefore could afford to be crusty and disobliging he did not at all like being turned out of his warm bed to open his house for us but no matter his household got up and cooked a quick supper for us and we brewed a hot punch for ourselves to keep off consumption after supper and punch we had an hours soothing smoke while we fought the naval battle over again and voted the resolutions then we retired to exceedingly neat and pretty chambers upstairs that had clean comfortable beds in them with heirloom pillowcases most elaborately and tastefully embroidered by hand such rooms and beds and embroidered linen are as frequent in german village inns as they are rare in ours our villages are superior to german villages in more merits excellences conveniences and privileges than i can enumerate but the hotels do not belong in the list the naturalist tavern was not a meaningless name for all the halls and all the rooms were lined with large glass cases which were filled with all sorts of birds and animals glass eyed ably stuffed and set up in the most natural eloquent and dramatic attitudes the moment we were abed the rain cleared away and the moon came out i dozed off to sleep while contemplating a great white stuffed owl which was looking intently down on me from a high perch with the air of a person who thought he had met me before but could not make out for certain but young z did not get off so easily he said that as he was sinking deliciously to sleep the moon lifted away the shadows and developed a huge cat on a bracket dead and stuffed but crouching with every muscle tense for a spring and with its glittering glass eyes aimed straight at him it made z uncomfortable he tried closing his own eyes but that did not answer for a natural instinct kept making him open them again to see if the cat was still getting ready to launch at him which she always was he tried turning his back but that was a failure he knew the sinister eyes were on him still so at last he had to get up after an hour or two of worry and experiment and set the cat out in the hall so he won that time chapter xviii the kindly courtesy of germans in the morning we took breakfast in the garden under the trees in the delightful german summer fashion the air was filled with the fragrance of flowers and wild animals the living portion of the menagerie of the naturalist tavern was all about us there were great cages populous with fluttering and chattering foreign birds and other great cages and greater wire pens populous with quadrupeds both native and foreign there were some free creatures too and quite sociable ones they were white rabbits went loping about the place and occasionally came and sniffed at our shoes and shins a fawn with a red ribbon on its neck walked up and examined us fearlessly rare breeds of chickens and doves begged for crumbs and a poor old tailless raven hopped about with a humble shamefaced mein which said please do not notice my exposure think how you would feel in my circumstances and be charitable if he was observed too much he would retire behind something and stay there until he judged the partys interest had found another object i never have seen another dumb creature that was so morbidly sensitive bayard taylor who could interpret the dim reasonings of animals and understood their moral natures better than most men would have found some way to make this poor old chap forget his troubles for a while but we have not his kindly art and so had to leave the raven to his griefs after breakfast we climbed the hill and visited the ancient castle of hirschhorn and the ruined church near it there were some curious old bas reliefs leaning against the inner walls of the church sculptured lords of hirschhorn in complete armor and ladies of hirschhorn in the picturesque court costumes of the middle ages these things are suffering damage and passing to decay for the last hirschhorn has been dead two hundred years and there is nobody now who cares to preserve the family relics in the chancel was a twisted stone column and the captain told us a legend about it of course for in the matter of legends he could not seem to restrain himself but i do not repeat his tale because there was nothing plausible about it except that the hero wrenched this column into its present screw shape with his hands just one single wrench all the rest of the legend was doubtful but hirschhorn is best seen from a distance down the river then the clustered brown towers perched on the green hilltop and the old battlemented stone wall stretching up and over the grassy ridge and disappearing in the leafy sea beyond make a picture whose grace and beauty entirely satisfy the eye we descended from the church by steep stone stairways which curved this way and that down narrow alleys between the packed and dirty tenements of the village it was a quarter well stocked with deformed leering unkempt and uncombed idiots who held out hands or caps and begged piteously the people of the quarter were not all idiots of course but all that begged seemed to be and were said to be i was thinking of going by skiff to the next town necharsteinach so i ran to the riverside in advance of the party and asked a man there if he had a boat to hire i suppose i must have spoken high german court german i intended it for that anyway so he did not understand me i turned and twisted my question around and about trying to strike that mans average but failed he could not make out what i wanted now mr x arrived faced this same man looked him in the eye and emptied this sentence on him in the most glib and confident way can man boat get here the mariner promptly understood and promptly answered i can comprehend why he was able to understand that particular sentence because by mere accident all the words in it except get have the same sound and the same meaning in german that they have in english but how he managed to understand mrx s next remark puzzled me i will insert it presently x turned away a moment and i asked the mariner if he could not find a board and so construct an additional seat i spoke in the purest german but i might as well have spoken in the purest choctaw for all the good it did the man tried his best to understand me he tried and kept on trying harder and harder until i saw it was really of no use and said there dont strain yourself it is of no consequence then x turned to him and crisply said machen sie a flat board i wish my epitaph may tell the truth about me if the man did not answer up at once and say he would go and borrow a board as soon as he had lit the pipe which he was filling we changed our mind about taking a boat so we did not have to go i have given mrx s two remarks just as he made them four of the five words in the first one were english and that they were also german was only accidental not intentional three out of the five words in the second remark were english and english only and the two german ones did not mean anything in particular in such a connection x always spoke english to germans but his plan was to turn the sentence wrong end first and upside down according to german construction and sprinkle in a german word without any essential meaning to it here and there by way of flavor yet he always made himself understood he could make those dialect speaking raftsmen understand him sometimes when even young z had failed with them and young z was a pretty good german scholar for one thingx always spoke with such confidence perhaps that helped and possibly the raftsmens dialect was what is called platt deutsch and so they found his english more familiar to their ears than another mans german quite indifferent students of german can read fritz reuters charming platt deutch tales with some little facility because many of the words are english i suppose this is the tongue which our saxon ancestors carried to england with them by and by i will inquire of some other philologist however in the mean time it had transpired that the men employed to calk the raft had found that the leak was not a leak at all but only a crack between the logs a crack that belonged there and was not dangerous but had been magnified into a leak by the disordered imagination of the mate therefore we went aboard again with a good degree of confidence and presently got to sea without accident as we swam smoothly along between the enchanting shores we fell to swapping notes about manners and customs in germany and elsewhere as i write now many months later i perceive that each of us by observing and noting and inquiring diligently and day by day had managed to lay in a most varied and opulent stock of misinformation but this is not surprising it is very difficult to get accurate details in any country for example i had the idea once in heidelberg to find out all about those five student corps i started with the white cap corps i began to inquire of this and that and the other citizen and here is what i found out it is called the prussian corps because none but prussians are admitted to it it is called the prussian corps for no particular reason it has simply pleased each corps to name itself after some german state it is not named the prussian corps at all but only the white cap corps any student can belong to it who is a german by birth any student can belong to it who is european by birth any european born student can belong to it except he be a frenchman any student can belong to it no matter where he was born no student can belong to it who is not of noble blood no student can belong to it who cannot show three full generations of noble descent nobility is not a necessary qualification no moneyless student can belong to it money qualification is nonsense such a thing has never been thought of i got some of this information from students themselves students who did not belong to the corps i finally went to headquarters to the white caps where i would have gone in the first place if i had been acquainted but even at headquarters i found difficulties i perceived that there were things about the white cap corps which one member knew and another one didnt it was natural for very few members of any organization know all that can be known about it i doubt there is a man or a woman in heidelberg who would not answer promptly and confidently three out of every five questions about the white cap corps which a stranger might ask yet it is a very safe bet that two of the three answers would be incorrect every time there is one german custom which is universal the bowing courteously to strangers when sitting down at table or rising up from it this bow startles a stranger out of his self possession the first time it occurs and he is likely to fall over a chair or something in his embarrassment but it pleases him nevertheless one soon learns to expect this bow and be on the lookout and ready to return it but to learn to lead off and make the initial bow ones self is a difficult matter for a diffident man one thinks if i rise to go and tender my bow and these ladies and gentlemen take it into their heads to ignore the custom of their nation and not return it how shall i feel in case i survive to feel anything therefore he is afraid to venture he sits out the dinner and makes the strangers rise first and originate the bowing a table dh te dinner is a tedious affair for a man who seldom touches anything after the three first courses therefore i used to do some pretty dreary waiting because of my fears it took me months to assure myself that those fears were groundless but i did assure myself at last by experimenting diligently through my agent i made harris get up and bow and leave invariably his bow was returned then i got up and bowed myself and retired thus my education proceeded easily and comfortably for me but not for harris three courses of a table dh te dinner were enough for me but harris preferred thirteen even after i had acquired full confidence and no longer needed the agents help i sometimes encountered difficulties once at baden baden i nearly lost a train because i could not be sure that three young ladies opposite me at table were germans since i had not heard them speak they might be american they might be english it was not safe to venture a bow but just as i had got that far with my thought one of them began a german remark to my great relief and gratitude and before she got out her third word our bows had been delivered and graciously returned and we were off there is a friendly something about the german character which is very winning when harris and i were making a pedestrian tour through the black forest we stopped at a little country inn for dinner one day two young ladies and a young gentleman entered and sat down opposite us they were pedestrians too our knapsacks were strapped upon our backs but they had a sturdy youth along to carry theirs for them all parties were hungry so there was no talking by and by the usual bows were exchanged and we separated as we sat at a late breakfast in the hotel at allerheiligen next morning these young people entered and took places near us without observing us but presently they saw us and at once bowed and smiled not ceremoniously but with the gratified look of people who have found acquaintances where they were expecting strangers then they spoke of the weather and the roads we also spoke of the weather and the roads next they said they had had an enjoyable walk notwithstanding the weather we said that that had been our case too then they said they had walked thirty english miles the day before and asked how many we had walked i could not lie so i told harris to do it harris told them we had made thirty english miles too that was true we had made them though we had had a little assistance here and there after breakfast they found us trying to blast some information out of the dumb hotel clerk about routes and observing that we were not succeeding pretty well they went and got their maps and things and pointed out and explained our course so clearly that even a new york detective could have followed it and when we started they spoke out a hearty good by and wished us a pleasant journey perhaps they were more generous with us than they might have been with native wayfarers because we were a forlorn lot and in a strange land i dont know i only know it was lovely to be treated so very well i took an american young lady to one of the fine balls in baden baden one night and at the entrance door upstairs we were halted by an official something about miss joness dress was not according to rule i dont remember what it was now something was wanting her back hair or a shawl or a fan or a shovel or something the official was ever so polite and ever so sorry but the rule was strict and he could not let us in it was very embarrassing for many eyes were on us but now a richly dressed girl stepped out of the ballroom inquired into the trouble and said she could fix it in a moment she took miss jones to the robing room and soon brought her back in regulation trim and then we entered the ballroom with this benefactress unchallenged being safe now i began to puzzle through my sincere but ungrammatical thanks when there was a sudden mutual recognition the benefactress and i had met at allerheiligen two weeks had not altered her good face and plainly her heart was in the right place yet but there was such a difference between these clothes and the clothes i had seen her in before when she was walking thirty miles a day in the black forest that it was quite natural that i had failed to recognize her sooner i had on my other suit too but my german would betray me to a person who had heard it once anyway she brought her brother and sister and they made our way smooth for that evening well months afterward i was driving through the streets of munich in a cab with a german lady one day when she said there that is prince ludwig and his wife walking along there everybody was bowing to them cabmen little children and everybody else and they were returning all the bows and overlooking nobody when a young lady met them and made a deep courtesy that is probably one of the ladies of the court said my german friend i said she is an honor to it then i know her i dont know her name but i know her i have known her at allerheiligen and baden baden she ought to be an empress but she may be only a duchess it is the way things go in this way if one asks a german a civil question he will be quite sure to get a civil answer if you stop a german in the street and ask him to direct you to a certain place he shows no sign of feeling offended if the place be difficult to find ten to one the man will drop his own matters and go with you and show you in london too many a time strangers have walked several blocks with me to show me my way there is something very real about this sort of politeness quite often in germany shopkeepers who could not furnish me the article i wanted have sent one of their employees with me to show me a place where it could be had chapter xix the deadly jest of dilsberg however i wander from the raft we made the port of necharsteinach in good season and went to the hotel and ordered a trout dinner the same to be ready against our return from a two hour pedestrian excursion to the village and castle of dilsberg a mile distant on the other side of the river i do not mean that we proposed to be two hours making two miles no we meant to employ most of the time in inspecting dilsberg for dilsberg is a quaint place it is most quaintly and picturesquely situated too imagine the beautiful river before you then a few rods of brilliant green sward on its opposite shore then a sudden hill no preparatory gently rising slopes but a sort of instantaneous hill a hill two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet high as round as a bowl with the same taper upward that an inverted bowl has and with about the same relation of height to diameter that distinguishes a bowl of good honest depth a hill which is thickly clothed with green bushes a comely shapely hill rising abruptly out of the dead level of the surrounding green plains visible from a great distance down the bends of the river and with just exactly room on the top of its head for its steepled and turreted and roof clustered cap of architecture which same is tightly jammed and compacted within the perfectly round hoop of the ancient village wall there is no house outside the wall on the whole hill or any vestige of a former house all the houses are inside the wall but there isnt room for another one it is really a finished town and has been finished a very long time there is no space between the wall and the first circle of buildings no the village wall is itself the rear wall of the first circle of buildings and the roofs jut a little over the wall and thus furnish it with eaves the general level of the massed roofs is gracefully broken and relieved by the dominating towers of the ruined castle and the tall spires of a couple of churches so from a distance dilsberg has rather more the look of a kings crown than a cap that lofty green eminence and its quaint coronet form quite a striking picture you may be sure in the flush of the evening sun we crossed over in a boat and began the ascent by a narrow steep path which plunged us at once into the leafy deeps of the bushes but they were not cool deeps by any means for the suns rays were weltering hot and there was little or no breeze to temper them as we panted up the sharp ascent we met brown bareheaded and barefooted boys and girls occasionally and sometimes men they came upon us without warning they gave us good day flashed out of sight in the bushes and were gone as suddenly and mysteriously as they had come they were bound for the other side of the river to work this path had been traveled by many generations of these people they have always gone down to the valley to earn their bread but they have always climbed their hill again to eat it and to sleep in their snug town it is said that the dilsbergers do not emigrate much they find that living up there above the world in their peaceful nest is pleasanter than living down in the troublous world the seven hundred inhabitants are all blood kin to each other too they have always been blood kin to each other for fifteen hundred years they are simply one large family and they like the home folks better than they like strangers hence they persistently stay at home it has been said that for ages dilsberg has been merely a thriving and diligent idiot factory i saw no idiots there but the captain said because of late years the government has taken to lugging them off to asylums and otherwheres and government wants to cripple the factory too and is trying to get these dilsbergers to marry out of the family but they dont like to the captain probably imagined all this as modern science denies that the intermarrying of relatives deteriorates the stock arrived within the wall we found the usual village sights and life we moved along a narrow crooked lane which had been paved in the middle ages a strapping ruddy girl was beating flax or some such stuff in a little bit of a good box of a barn and she swung her flail with a will if it was a flail i was not farmer enough to know what she was at a frowsy barelegged girl was herding half a dozen geese with a stick driving them along the lane and keeping them out of the dwellings a cooper was at work in a shop which i know he did not make so large a thing as a hogshead in for there was not room in the front rooms of dwellings girls and women were cooking or spinning and ducks and chickens were waddling in and out over the threshold picking up chance crumbs and holding pleasant converse a very old and wrinkled man sat asleep before his door with his chin upon his breast and his extinguished pipe in his lap soiled children were playing in the dirt everywhere along the lane unmindful of the sun except the sleeping old man everybody was at work but the place was very still and peaceful nevertheless so still that the distant cackle of the successful hen smote upon the ear but little dulled by intervening sounds that commonest of village sights was lacking here the public pump with its great stone tank or trough of limpid water and its group of gossiping pitcher bearers for there is no well or fountain or spring on this tall hill cisterns of rain water are used our alpenstocks and muslin tails compelled attention and as we moved through the village we gathered a considerable procession of little boys and girls and so went in some state to the castle it proved to be an extensive pile of crumbling walls arches and towers massive properly grouped for picturesque effect weedy grass grown and satisfactory the children acted as guides they walked us along the top of the highest walls then took us up into a high tower and showed us a wide and beautiful landscape made up of wavy distances of woody hills and a nearer prospect of undulating expanses of green lowlands on the one hand and castle graced crags and ridges on the other with the shining curves of the neckar flowing between but the principal show the chief pride of the children was the ancient and empty well in the grass grown court of the castle its massive stone curb stands up three or four feet above ground and is whole and uninjured the children said that in the middle ages this well was four hundred feet deep and furnished all the village with an abundant supply of water in war and peace they said that in the old day its bottom was below the level of the neckar hence the water supply was inexhaustible but there were some who believed it had never been a well at all and was never deeper than it is now eighty feet that at that depth a subterranean passage branched from it and descended gradually to a remote place in the valley where it opened into somebodys cellar or other hidden recess and that the secret of this locality is now lost those who hold this belief say that herein lies the explanation that dilsberg besieged by tilly and many a soldier before him was never taken after the longest and closest sieges the besiegers were astonished to perceive that the besieged were as fat and hearty as ever and were well furnished with munitions of war therefore it must be that the dilsbergers had been bringing these things in through the subterranean passage all the time the children said that there was in truth a subterranean outlet down there and they would prove it so they set a great truss of straw on fire and threw it down the well while we leaned on the curb and watched the glowing mass descend it struck bottom and gradually burned out no smoke came up the children clapped their hands and said you see nothing makes so much smoke as burning straw now where did the smoke go to if there is no subterranean outlet so it seemed quite evident that the subterranean outlet indeed existed but the finest thing within the ruins limits was a noble linden which the children said was four hundred years old and no doubt it was it had a mighty trunk and a mighty spread of limb and foliage the limbs near the ground were nearly the thickness of a barrel that tree had witnessed the assaults of men in mail how remote such a time seems and how ungraspable is the fact that real men ever did fight in real armor and it had seen the time when these broken arches and crumbling battlements were a trim and strong and stately fortress fluttering its gay banners in the sun and peopled with vigorous humanity how impossibly long ago that seems and here it stands yet and possibly may still be standing here sunning itself and dreaming its historical dreams when today shall have been joined to the days called ancient well we sat down under the tree to smoke and the captain delivered himself of his legend the legend of dilsberg castle it was to this effect in the old times there was once a great company assembled at the castle and festivity ran high of course there was a haunted chamber in the castle and one day the talk fell upon that it was said that whoever slept in it would not wake again for fifty years now when a young knight named conrad von geisberg heard this he said that if the castle were his he would destroy that chamber so that no foolish person might have the chance to bring so dreadful a misfortune upon himself and afflict such as loved him with the memory of it straightway the company privately laid their heads together to contrive some way to get this superstitious young man to sleep in that chamber and they succeeded in this way they persuaded his betrothed a lovely mischievous young creature niece of the lord of the castle to help them in their plot she presently took him aside and had speech with him she used all her persuasions but could not shake him he said his belief was firm that if he should sleep there he would wake no more for fifty years and it made him shudder to think of it catharina began to weep this was a better argument conrad could not hold out against it he yielded and said she should have her wish if she would only smile and be happy again she flung her arms about his neck and the kisses she gave him showed that her thankfulness and her pleasure were very real then she flew to tell the company her success and the applause she received made her glad and proud she had undertaken her mission since all alone she had accomplished what the multitude had failed in at midnight that night after the usual feasting conrad was taken to the haunted chamber and left there he fell asleep by and by when he awoke again and looked about him his heart stood still with horror the whole aspect of the chamber was changed the walls were moldy and hung with ancient cobwebs the curtains and beddings were rotten the furniture was rickety and ready to fall to pieces he sprang out of bed but his quaking knees sunk under him and he fell to the floor this is the weakness of age he said he rose and sought his clothing it was clothing no longer the colors were gone the garments gave way in many places while he was putting them on he fled shuddering into the corridor and along it to the great hall here he was met by a middle aged stranger of a kind countenance who stopped and gazed at him with surprise conrad said good sir will you send hither the lord ulrich the stranger looked puzzled a moment then said the lord ulrich yes if you will be so good the stranger called wilhelm a young serving man came and the stranger said to him is there a lord ulrich among the guests i know none of the name so please your honor conrad said hesitatingly i did not mean a guest but the lord of the castle sir the stranger and the servant exchanged wondering glances then the former said i am the lord of the castle since when sir since the death of my father the good lord ulrich more than forty years ago conrad sank upon a bench and covered his face with his hands while he rocked his body to and fro and moaned the stranger said in a low voice to the servant i fear me this poor old creature is mad call some one in a moment several people came and grouped themselves about talking in whispers conrad looked up and scanned the faces about him wistfully then he shook his head and said in a grieved voice no there is none among ye that i know i am old and alone in the world they are dead and gone these many years that cared for me but sure some of these aged ones i see about me can tell me some little word or two concerning them several bent and tottering men and women came nearer and answered his questions about each former friend as he mentioned the names this one they said had been dead ten years that one twenty another thirty each succeeding blow struck heavier and heavier at last the sufferer said there is one more but i have not the courage too my lost catharina one of the old dames said ah i knew her well poor soul a misfortune overtook her lover and she died of sorrow nearly fifty years ago she lieth under the linden tree without the court conrad bowed his head and said ah why did i ever wake and so she died of grief for me poor child so young so sweet so good she never wittingly did a hurtful thing in all the little summer of her life her loving debt shall be repaid for i will die of grief for her his head drooped upon his breast in the moment there was a wild burst of joyous laughter a pair of round young arms were flung about conrads neck and a sweet voice cried there conrad mine thy kind words kill me the farce shall go no further look up and laugh with us twas all a jest and he did look up and gazed in a dazed wonderment for the disguises were stripped away and the aged men and women were bright and young and gay again catharinas happy tongue ran on twas a marvelous jest and bravely carried out they gave you a heavy sleeping draught before you went to bed and in the night they bore you to a ruined chamber where all had fallen to decay and placed these rags of clothing by you and when your sleep was spent and you came forth two strangers well instructed in their parts were here to meet you and all we your friends in our disguises were close at hand to see and hear you may be sure ah twas a gallant jest come now and make thee ready for the pleasures of the day how real was thy misery for the moment thou poor lad look up and have thy laugh now he looked up searched the merry faces about him in a dreamy way then sighed and said i am aweary good strangers i pray you lead me to her grave all the smile vanished away every cheek blanched catharina sunk to the ground in a swoon all day the people went about the castle with troubled faces and communed together in undertones a painful hush pervaded the place which had lately been so full of cheery life each in his turn tried to arouse conrad out of his hallucination and bring him to himself but all the answer any got was a meek bewildered stare and then the words good stranger i have no friends all are at rest these many years ye speak me fair ye mean me well but i know ye not i am alone and forlorn in the world prithee lead me to her grave during two years conrad spent his days from the early morning till the night under the linden tree mourning over the imaginary grave of his catharina catharina was the only company of the harmless madman he was very friendly toward her because as he said in some ways she reminded him of his catharina whom he had lost fifty years ago he often said she was so gay so happy hearted but you never smile and always when you think i am not looking you cry when conrad died they buried him under the linden according to his directions so that he might rest near his poor catharina then catharina sat under the linden alone every day and all day long a great many years speaking to no one and never smiling and at last her long repentance was rewarded with death and she was buried by conrads side harris pleased the captain by saying it was good legend and pleased him further by adding now that i have seen this mighty tree vigorous with its four hundred years i feel a desire to believe the legend for its sake so i will humor the desire and consider that the tree really watches over those poor hearts and feels a sort of human tenderness for them we returned to necharsteinach plunged our hot heads into the trough at the town pump and then went to the hotel and ate our trout dinner in leisurely comfort in the garden with the beautiful neckar flowing at our feet the quaint dilsberg looming beyond and the graceful towers and battlements of a couple of medieval castles called the swallows nest and the brothers assisting the rugged scenery of a bend of the river down to our right we got to sea in season to make the eight mile run to heidelberg before the night shut down we sailed by the hotel in the mellow glow of sunset and came slashing down with the mad current into the narrow passage between the dikes i believed i could shoot the bridge myself and i went to the forward triplet of logs and relieved the pilot of his pole and his responsibility the seeker after information is referred to appendix e for our captains legend of the swallows nest and the brothers we went tearing along in a most exhilarating way and i performed the delicate duties of my office very well indeed for a first attempt but perceiving presently that i really was going to shoot the bridge itself instead of the archway under it i judiciously stepped ashore the next moment i had my long coveted desire i saw a raft wrecked it hit the pier in the center and went all to smash and scatteration like a box of matches struck by lightning i was the only one of our party who saw this grand sight the others were attitudinizing for the benefit of the long rank of young ladies who were promenading on the bank and so they lost it but i helped to fish them out of the river down below the bridge and then described it to them as well as i could they were not interested though they said they were wet and felt ridiculous and did not care anything for descriptions of scenery the young ladies and other people crowded around and showed a great deal of sympathy but that did not help matters for my friends said they did not want sympathy they wanted a back alley and solitude chapter xx my precious priceless tear jug next morning brought good news our trunks had arrived from hamburg at last let this be a warning to the reader the germans are very conscientious and this trait makes them very particular therefore if you tell a german you want a thing done immediately he takes you at your word he thinks you mean what you say so he does that thing immediately according to his idea of immediately which is about a week that is it is a week if it refers to the building of a garment or it is an hour and a half if it refers to the cooking of a trout very well if you tell a german to send your trunk to you by slow freight he takes you at your word he sends it by slow freight and you cannot imagine how long you will go on enlarging your admiration of the expressiveness of that phrase in the german tongue before you get that trunk the hair on my trunk was soft and thick and youthful when i got it ready for shipment in hamburg it was baldheaded when it reached heidelberg however it was still sound that was a comfort it was not battered in the least the baggagemen seemed to be conscientiously careful in germany of the baggage entrusted to their hands there was nothing now in the way of our departure therefore we set about our preparations naturally my chief solicitude was about my collection of ceramics of course i could not take it with me that would be inconvenient and dangerous besides i took advice but the best brick a brackers were divided as to the wisest course to pursue some said pack the collection and warehouse it others said try to get it into the grand ducal museum at mannheim for safe keeping so i divided the collection and followed the advice of both parties i set aside for the museum those articles which were the most frail and precious among these was my etruscan tear jug i have made a little sketch of it here that thing creeping up the side is not a bug it is a hole i bought this tear jug of a dealer in antiquities for four hundred and fifty dollars it is very rare the man said the etruscans used to keep tears or something in these things and that it was very hard to get hold of a broken one now i also set aside my henri ii plate see sketch from my pencil it is in the main correct though i think i have foreshortened one end of it a little too much perhaps this is very fine and rare the shape is exceedingly beautiful and unusual it has wonderful decorations on it but i am not able to reproduce them it cost more than the tear jug as the dealer said there was not another plate just like it in the world he said there was much false henri ii ware around but that the genuineness of this piece was unquestionable he showed me its pedigree or its history if you please it was a document which traced this plates movements all the way down from its birth showed who bought it from whom and what he paid for it from the first buyer down to me whereby i saw that it had gone steadily up from thirty five cents to seven hundred dollars he said that the whole ceramic world would be informed that it was now in my possession and would make a note of it with the price paid figure there were masters in those days but alas it is not so now of course the main preciousness of this piece lies in its color it is that old sensuous pervading ramifying interpolating transboreal blue which is the despair of modern art the little sketch which i have made of this gem cannot and does not do it justice since i have been obliged to leave out the color but i ve got the expression though however i must not be frittering away the readers time with these details i did not intend to go into any detail at all at first but it is the failing of the true ceramiker or the true devotee in any department of brick a brackery that once he gets his tongue or his pen started on his darling theme he cannot well stop until he drops from exhaustion he has no more sense of the flight of time than has any other lover when talking of his sweetheart the very marks on the bottom of a piece of rare crockery are able to throw me into a gibbering ecstasy and i could forsake a drowning relative to help dispute about whether the stopple of a departed buon retiro scent bottle was genuine or spurious many people say that for a male person bric a brac hunting is about as robust a business as making doll clothes or decorating japanese pots with decalcomania butterflies would be and these people fling mud at the elegant englishman byng who wrote a book called the bric a brac hunter and make fun of him for chasing around after what they choose to call his despicable trifles and for gushing over these trifles and for exhibiting his deep infantile delight in what they call his tuppenny collection of beggarly trivialities and for beginning his book with a picture of himself seated in a sappy self complacent attitude in the midst of his poor little ridiculous bric a brac junk shop it is easy to say these things it is easy to revile us easy to despise us therefore let these people rail on they cannot feel as byng and i feel it is their loss not ours for my part i am content to be a brick a bracker and a ceramiker more i am proud to be so named i am proud to know that i lose my reason as immediately in the presence of a rare jug with an illustrious mark on the bottom of it as if i had just emptied that jug very well i packed and stored a part of my collection and the rest of it i placed in the care of the grand ducal museum in mannheim by permission my old blue china cat remains there yet i presented it to that excellent institution i had but one misfortune with my things an egg which i had kept back from breakfast that morning was broken in packing it was a great pity i had shown it to the best connoisseurs in heidelberg and they all said it was an antique we spent a day or two in farewell visits and then left for baden baden we had a pleasant trip to it for the rhine valley is always lovely the only trouble was that the trip was too short if i remember rightly it only occupied a couple of hours therefore i judge that the distance was very little if any over fifty miles we quitted the train at oos and walked the entire remaining distance to baden baden with the exception of a lift of less than an hour which we got on a passing wagon the weather being exhaustingly warm we came into town on foot one of the first persons we encountered as we walked up the street was the rev mr an old friend from america a lucky encounter indeed for his is a most gentle refined and sensitive nature and his company and companionship are a genuine refreshment we knew he had been in europe some time but were not at all expecting to run across him both parties burst forth into loving enthusiasms and rev mr said i have got a brimful reservoir of talk to pour out on you and an empty one ready and thirsting to receive what you have got we will sit up till midnight and have a good satisfying interchange for i leave here early in the morning we agreed to that of course i had been vaguely conscious for a while of a person who was walking in the street abreast of us i had glanced furtively at him once or twice and noticed that he was a fine large vigorous young fellow with an open independent countenance faintly shaded with a pale and even almost imperceptible crop of early down and that he was clothed from head to heel in cool and enviable snow white linen i thought i had also noticed that his head had a sort of listening tilt to it now about this time the rev mr said the sidewalk is hardly wide enough for three so i will walk behind but keep the talk going keep the talk going theres no time to lose and you may be sure i will do my share he ranged himself behind us and straightway that stately snow white young fellow closed up to the sidewalk alongside him fetched him a cordial slap on the shoulder with his broad palm and sung out with a hearty cheeriness americans for two and a half and the money up hey the reverend winced but said mildly yes we are americans lord love you you can just bet thats what i am every time put it there he held out his sahara of his palm and the reverend laid his diminutive hand in it and got so cordial a shake that we heard his glove burst under it say didnt i put you up right oh yes sho i spotted you for my kind the minute i heard your clack you been over here long about four months have you been over long long well i should say so going on two years by geeminy say are you homesick no i cant say that i am are you oh hell yes this with immense enthusiasm the reverend shrunk a little in his clothes and we were aware rather by instinct than otherwise that he was throwing out signals of distress to us but we did not interfere or try to succor him for we were quite happy the young fellow hooked his arm into the reverends now with the confiding and grateful air of a waif who has been longing for a friend and a sympathetic ear and a chance to lisp once more the sweet accents of the mother tongue and then he limbered up the muscles of his mouth and turned himself loose and with such a relish some of his words were not sunday school words so i am obliged to put blanks where they occur yes indeedy if i aint an american there aint any americans thats all and when i heard you fellows gassing away in the good old american language im if it wasnt all i could do to keep from hugging you my tongues all warped with trying to curl it around these forsaken wind galled nine jointed german words here now i tell you its awful good to lay it over a christian word once more and kind of let the old taste soak it im from western new york my name is cholley adams im a student you know been here going on two years im learning to be a horse doctor i like that part of it you know but these people they wont learn a fellow in his own language they make him learn in german so before i could tackle the horse doctoring i had to tackle this miserable language first off i thought it would certainly give me the botts but i dont mind now i ve got it where the hairs short i think and dontchuknow they made me learn latin too now between you and me i wouldnt give a for all the latin that was ever jabbered and the first thing i calculate to do when i get through is to just sit down and forget it twont take me long and i dont mind the time anyway and i tell you what the difference between school teaching over yonder and school teaching over here sho we dont know anything about it here you ve got to peg and peg and peg and there just aint any let up and what you learn here you ve got to know dontchuknow or else you ll have one of these spavined spectacles ring boned knock kneed old professors in your hair i ve been here long enough and im getting blessed tired of it mind i tell you the old man wrote me that he was coming over in june and said hed take me home in august whether i was done with my education or not but durn him he didnt come never said why just sent me a hamper of sunday school books and told me to be good and hold on a while i dont take to sunday school books dontchuknow i dont hanker after them when i can get pie but i read them anyway because whatever the old man tells me to do thats the thing that im a going to do or tear something you know i buckled in and read all those books because he wanted me to but that kind of thing dont excite me i like something hearty but im awful homesick im homesick from ear socket to crupper and from crupper to hock joint but it aint any use i ve got to stay here till the old man drops the rag and give the word yes sir right here in this country i ve got to linger till the old man says come and you bet your bottom dollar johnny it aint just as easy as it is for a cat to have twins at the end of this profane and cordial explosion he fetched a prodigious whoosh to relieve his lungs and make recognition of the heat and then he straightway dived into his narrative again for johnnys benefit beginning well it aint any use talking some of those old american words do have a kind of a bully swing to them a man can express himself with em a man can get at what he wants to say dontchuknow when we reached our hotel and it seemed that he was about to lose the reverend he showed so much sorrow and begged so hard and so earnestly that the reverends heart was not hard enough to hold out against the pleadings so he went away with the parent honoring student like a right christian and took supper with him in his lodgings and sat in the surf beat of his slang and profanity till near midnight and then left him left him pretty well talked out but grateful clear down to his frogs as he expressed it the reverend said it had transpired during the interview that cholley adamss father was an extensive dealer in horses in western new york this accounted for cholleys choice of a profession the reverend brought away a pretty high opinion of cholley as a manly young fellow with stuff in him for a useful citizen he considered him rather a rough gem but a gem nevertheless chapter xxi insolent shopkeepers and gabbling americans baden baden sits in the lap of the hills and the natural and artificial beauties of the surroundings are combined effectively and charmingly the level strip of ground which stretches through and beyond the town is laid out in handsome pleasure grounds shaded by noble trees and adorned at intervals with lofty and sparkling fountain jets thrice a day a fine band makes music in the public promenade before the conversation house and in the afternoon and evening that locality is populous with fashionably dressed people of both sexes who march back and forth past the great music stand and look very much bored though they make a show of feeling otherwise it seems like a rather aimless and stupid existence a good many of these people are there for a real purpose however they are racked with rheumatism and they are there to stew it out in the hot baths these invalids looked melancholy enough limping about on their canes and crutches and apparently brooding over all sorts of cheerless things people say that germany with her damp stone houses is the home of rheumatism if that is so providence must have foreseen that it would be so and therefore filled the land with the healing baths perhaps no other country is so generously supplied with medicinal springs as germany some of these baths are good for one ailment some for another and again peculiar ailments are conquered by combining the individual virtues of several different baths for instance for some forms of disease the patient drinks the native hot water of baden baden with a spoonful of salt from the carlsbad springs dissolved in it that is not a dose to be forgotten right away they dont sell this hot water no you go into the great trinkhalle and stand around first on one foot and then on the other while two or three young girls sit pottering at some sort of ladylike sewing work in your neighborhood and cant seem to see you polite as three dollar clerks in government offices by and by one of these rises painfully and stretches stretches fists and body heavenward till she raises her heels from the floor at the same time refreshing herself with a yawn of such comprehensiveness that the bulk of her face disappears behind her upper lip and one is able to see how she is constructed inside then she slowly closes her cavern brings down her fists and her heels comes languidly forward contemplates you contemptuously draws you a glass of hot water and sets it down where you can get it by reaching for it you take it and say how much and she returns you with elaborate indifference a beggars answer nach beliebe what you please this thing of using the common beggars trick and the common beggars shibboleth to put you on your liberality when you were expecting a simple straightforward commercial transaction adds a little to your prospering sense of irritation you ignore her reply and ask again how much and she calmly indifferently repeats nach beliebe you are getting angry but you are trying not to show it you resolve to keep on asking your question till she changes her answer or at least her annoyingly indifferent manner therefore if your case be like mine you two fools stand there and without perceptible emotion of any kind or any emphasis on any syllable you look blandly into each others eyes and hold the following idiotic conversation how much nach beliebe how much nach beliebe how much nach beliebe how much nach beliebe how much nach beliebe how much nach beliebe i do not know what another person would have done but at this point i gave up that cast iron indifference that tranquil contemptuousness conquered me and i struck my colors now i knew she was used to receiving about a penny from manly people who care nothing about the opinions of scullery maids and about tuppence from moral cowards but i laid a silver twenty five cent piece within her reach and tried to shrivel her up with this sarcastic speech if it isnt enough will you stoop sufficiently from your official dignity to say so she did not shrivel without deigning to look at me at all she languidly lifted the coin and bit it to see if it was good then she turned her back and placidly waddled to her former roost again tossing the money into an open till as she went along she was victor to the last you see i have enlarged upon the ways of this girl because they are typical her manners are the manners of a goodly number of the baden baden shopkeepers the shopkeeper there swindles you if he can and insults you whether he succeeds in swindling you or not the keepers of baths also take great and patient pains to insult you the frowsy woman who sat at the desk in the lobby of the great friederichsbad and sold bath tickets not only insulted me twice every day with rigid fidelity to her great trust but she took trouble enough to cheat me out of a shilling one day to have fairly entitled her to ten baden badens splendid gamblers are gone only her microscopic knaves remain an english gentleman who had been living there several years said if you could disguise your nationality you would not find any insolence here these shopkeepers detest the english and despise the americans they are rude to both more especially to ladies of your nationality and mine if these go shopping without a gentleman or a man servant they are tolerably sure to be subjected to petty insolences insolences of manner and tone rather than word though words that are hard to bear are not always wanting i know of an instance where a shopkeeper tossed a coin back to an american lady with the remark snappishly uttered we dont take french money here and i know of a case where an english lady said to one of these shopkeepers dont you think you ask too much for this article and he replied with the question do you think you are obliged to buy it however these people are not impolite to russians or germans and as to rank they worship that for they have long been used to generals and nobles if you wish to see what abysses servility can descend present yourself before a baden baden shopkeeper in the character of a russian prince it is an inane town filled with sham and petty fraud and snobbery but the baths are good i spoke with many people and they were all agreed in that i had the twinges of rheumatism unceasingly during three years but the last one departed after a fortnights bathing there and i have never had one since i fully believe i left my rheumatism in baden baden baden baden is welcome to it it was little but it was all i had to give i would have preferred to leave something that was catching but it was not in my power there are several hot springs there and during two thousand years they have poured forth a never diminishing abundance of the healing water this water is conducted in pipe to the numerous bath houses and is reduced to an endurable temperature by the addition of cold water the new friederichsbad is a very large and beautiful building and in it one may have any sort of bath that has ever been invented and with all the additions of herbs and drugs that his ailment may need or that the physician of the establishment may consider a useful thing to put into the water you go there enter the great door get a bow graduated to your style and clothes from the gorgeous portier and a bath ticket and an insult from the frowsy woman for a quarter she strikes a bell and a serving man conducts you down a long hall and shuts you into a commodious room which has a washstand a mirror a bootjack and a sofa in it and there you undress at your leisure the room is divided by a great curtain you draw this curtain aside and find a large white marble bathtub with its rim sunk to the level of the floor and with three white marble steps leading down to it this tub is full of water which is as clear as crystal and is tempered to degrees re aumur about degrees fahrenheit sunk into the floor by the tub is a covered copper box which contains some warm towels and a sheet you look fully as white as an angel when you are stretched out in that limpid bath you remain in it ten minutes the first time and afterward increase the duration from day to day till you reach twenty five or thirty minutes there you stop the appointments of the place are so luxurious the benefit so marked the price so moderate and the insults so sure that you very soon find yourself adoring the friederichsbad and infesting it we had a plain simple unpretending good hotel in baden baden the h tel de france and alongside my room i had a giggling cackling chattering family who always went to bed just two hours after me and always got up two hours ahead of me but this is common in german hotels the people generally go to bed long after eleven and get up long before eight the partitions convey sound like a drum head and everybody knows it but no matter a german family who are all kindness and consideration in the daytime make apparently no effort to moderate their noises for your benefit at night they will sing laugh and talk loudly and bang furniture around in a most pitiless way if you knock on your wall appealingly they will quiet down and discuss the matter softly among themselves for a moment then like the mice they fall to persecuting you again and as vigorously as before they keep cruelly late and early hours for such noisy folk of course when one begins to find fault with foreign peoples ways he is very likely to get a reminder to look nearer home before he gets far with it i open my note book to see if i can find some more information of a valuable nature about baden baden and the first thing i fall upon is this baden baden no date lot of vociferous americans at breakfast this morning talking at everybody while pretending to talk among themselves on their first travels manifestly showing off the usual signs airy easy going references to grand distances and foreign places well good by old fellow if i dont run across you in italy you hunt me up in london before you sail the next item which i find in my note book is this one the fact that a band of indians are now murdering our frontiersmen at their impudent leisure and that we are only able to send soldiers against them is utilized here to discourage emigration to america the common people think the indians are in new jersey this is a new and peculiar argument against keeping our army down to a ridiculous figure in the matter of numbers it is rather a striking one too i have not distorted the truth in saying that the facts in the above item about the army and the indians are made use of to discourage emigration to america that the common people should be rather foggy in their geography and foggy as to the location of the indians is a matter for amusement maybe but not of surprise there is an interesting old cemetery in baden baden and we spent several pleasant hours in wandering through it and spelling out the inscriptions on the aged tombstones apparently after a man has laid there a century or two and has had a good many people buried on top of him it is considered that his tombstone is not needed by him any longer i judge so from the fact that hundreds of old gravestones have been removed from the graves and placed against the inner walls of the cemetery what artists they had in the old times they chiseled angels and cherubs and devils and skeletons on the tombstones in the most lavish and generous way as to supply but curiously grotesque and outlandish as to form it is not always easy to tell which of the figures belong among the blest and which of them among the opposite party but there was an inscription in french on one of those old stones which was quaint and pretty and was plainly not the work of any other than a poet it was to this effect here reposes in god caroline de clery a religieuse of st denis aged years and blind the light was restored to her in baden the th of january we made several excursions on foot to the neighboring villages over winding and beautiful roads and through enchanting woodland scenery the woods and roads were similar to those at heidelberg but not so bewitching i suppose that roads and woods which are up to the heidelberg mark are rare in the world once we wandered clear away to la favorita palace which is several miles from baden baden the grounds about the palace were fine the palace was a curiosity it was built by a margravine in and remains as she left it at her death we wandered through a great many of its rooms and they all had striking peculiarities of decoration for instance the walls of one room were pretty completely covered with small pictures of the margravine in all conceivable varieties of fanciful costumes some of them male the walls of another room were covered with grotesquely and elaborately figured hand wrought tapestry the musty ancient beds remained in the chambers and their quilts and curtains and canopies were decorated with curious handwork and the walls and ceilings frescoed with historical and mythological scenes in glaring colors there was enough crazy and rotten rubbish in the building to make a true brick a bracker green with envy a painting in the dining hall verged upon the indelicate but then the margravine was herself a trifle indelicate it is in every way a wildly and picturesquely decorated house and brimful of interest as a reflection of the character and tastes of that rude bygone time in the grounds a few rods from the palace stands the margravines chapel just as she left it a coarse wooden structure wholly barren of ornament it is said that the margravine would give herself up to debauchery and exceedingly fast living for several months at a time and then retire to this miserable wooden den and spend a few months in repenting and getting ready for another good time she was a devoted catholic and was perhaps quite a model sort of a christian as christians went then in high life tradition says she spent the last two years of her life in the strange den i have been speaking of after having indulged herself in one final triumphant and satisfying spree she shut herself up there without company and without even a servant and so abjured and forsook the world in her little bit of a kitchen she did her own cooking she wore a hair shirt next the skin and castigated herself with whips these aids to grace are exhibited there yet she prayed and told her beads in another little room before a waxen virgin niched in a little box against the wall she bedded herself like a slave in another small room is an unpainted wooden table and behind it sit half life size waxen figures of the holy family made by the very worst artist that ever lived perhaps and clothed in gaudy flimsy drapery the margravine used to bring her meals to this table and dine with the holy family what an idea that was what a grisly spectacle it must have been imagine it those rigid shock headed figures with corpsy complexions and fish glass eyes occupying one side of the table in the constrained attitudes and dead fixedness that distinguish all men that are born of wax and this wrinkled smoldering old fire eater occupying the other side mumbling her prayers and munching her sausages in the ghostly stillness and shadowy indistinctness of a winter twilight it makes one feel crawly even to think of it the savior was represented as a lad of about fifteen years of age this figure had lost one eye in this sordid place and clothed bedded and fed like a pauper this strange princess lived and worshiped during two years and in it she died two or three hundred years ago this would have made the poor den holy ground and the church would have set up a miracle factory there and made plenty of money out of it the den could be moved into some portions of france and made a good

of the time one cannot describe those noble woods nor the feeling with which they inspire him a feature of the feeling however is a deep sense of contentment another feature of it is a buoyant boyish gladness and a third and very conspicuous feature of it is ones sense of the remoteness of the work day world and his entire emancipation from it and its affairs those woods stretch unbroken over a vast region and everywhere they are such dense woods and so still and so piney and fragrant the stems of the trees are trim and straight and in many places all the ground is hidden for miles under a thick cushion of moss of a vivid green color with not a decayed or ragged spot in its surface and not a fallen leaf or twig to mar its immaculate tidiness a rich cathedral gloom pervades the pillared aisles so the stray flecks of sunlight that strike a trunk here and a bough yonder are strongly accented and when they strike the moss they fairly seem to burn but the weirdest effect and the most enchanting is that produced by the diffused light of the low afternoon sun no single ray is able to pierce its way in then but the diffused light takes color from moss and foliage and pervades the place like a faint green tinted mist the theatrical fire of fairyland the suggestion of mystery and the supernatural which haunts the forest at all times is intensified by this unearthly glow we found the black forest farmhouses and villages all that the black forest stories have pictured them the first genuine specimen which we came upon was the mansion of a rich farmer and member of the common council of the parish or district he was an important personage in the land and so was his wife also of course his daughter was the catch of the region and she may be already entering into immortality as the heroine of one of auerbachs novels for all i know we shall see for if he puts her in i shall recognize her by her black forest clothes and her burned complexion her plump figure her fat hands her dull expression her gentle spirit her generous feet her bonnetless head and the plaited tails of hemp colored hair hanging down her back the house was big enough for a hotel it was a hundred feet long and fifty wide and ten feet high from ground to eaves but from the eaves to the comb of the mighty roof was as much as forty feet or maybe even more this roof was of ancient mud colored straw thatch a foot thick and was covered all over except in a few trifling spots with a thriving and luxurious growth of green vegetation mainly moss the mossless spots were places where repairs had been made by the insertion of bright new masses of yellow straw the eaves projected far down like sheltering hospitable wings across the gable that fronted the road and about ten feet above the ground ran a narrow porch with a wooden railing a row of small windows filled with very small panes looked upon the porch above were two or three other little windows one clear up under the sharp apex of the roof before the ground floor door was a huge pile of manure the door of the second story room on the side of the house was open and occupied by the rear elevation of a cow was this probably the drawing room all of the front half of the house from the ground up seemed to be occupied by the people the cows and the chickens and all the rear half by draught animals and hay but the chief feature all around this house was the big heaps of manure we became very familiar with the fertilizer in the forest we fell unconsciously into the habit of judging of a mans station in life by this outward and eloquent sign sometimes we said here is a poor devil this is manifest when we saw a stately accumulation we said here is a banker when we encountered a country seat surrounded by an alpine pomp of manure we said doubtless a duke lives here the importance of this feature has not been properly magnified in the black forest stories manure is evidently the black foresters main treasure his coin his jewel his pride his old master his ceramics his bric a brac his darling his title to public consideration envy veneration and his first solicitude when he gets ready to make his will the true black forest novel if it is ever written will be skeletoned somewhat in this way skeleton for a black forest novel rich old farmer named huss has inherited great wealth of manure and by diligence has added to it it is double starred in baedeker the black forest artist paints it his masterpiece the king comes to see it gretchen huss daughter and heiress paul hoch young neighbor suitor for gretchens hand ostensibly he really wants the manure hoch has a good many cart loads of the black forest currency himself and therefore is a good catch but he is sordid mean and without sentiment whereas gretchen is all sentiment and poetry hans schmidt young neighbor full of sentiment full of poetry loves gretchen gretchen loves him but he has no manure old huss forbids him in the house his heart breaks he goes

the black forest lives to a good old age blessed with the love of his wife and of his twenty seven children and the still sweeter envy of everybody around we took our noon meal of fried trout one day at the plow inn in a very pretty village ottenhoefen and then went into the public room to rest and smoke there we found nine or ten black forest grandees assembled around a table they were the common council of the parish they had gathered there at eight o clock that morning to elect a new member and they had now been drinking beer four hours at the new members expense they were men of fifty or sixty years of age with grave good natured faces and were all dressed in the costume made familiar to us by the black forest stories broad round topped black felt hats with the brims curled up all round long red waistcoats with large metal buttons black alpaca coats with the waists up between the shoulders there were no speeches there was but little talk there were no frivolities the council filled themselves gradually steadily but surely with beer and conducted themselves with sedate decorum as became men of position men of influence men of manure we had a hot afternoon tramp up the valley along the grassy bank of a rushing stream of clear water past farmhouses water mills and no end of wayside crucifixes and saints and virgins these crucifixes etc are set up in memory of departed friends by survivors and are almost as frequent as telegraph poles are in other lands we followed the carriage road and had our usual luck we traveled under a beating sun and always saw the shade leave the shady places before we could get to them in all our wanderings we seldom managed to strike a piece of road at its time for being shady we had a particularly hot time of it on that particular afternoon and with no comfort but what we could get out of the fact that the peasants at work away up on the steep mountainsides above our heads were even worse off than we were by and by it became impossible to endure the intolerable glare and heat any longer so we struck across the ravine and entered the deep cool twilight of the forest to hunt for what the guide book called the old road we found an old road and it proved eventually to be the right one though we followed it at the time with the conviction that it was the wrong one if it was the wrong one there could be no use in hurrying therefore we did not hurry but sat down frequently on the soft moss and enjoyed the restful quiet and shade of the forest solitudes there had been distractions in the carriage road school children peasants wagons troops of pedestrianizing students from all over germany but we had the old road to ourselves now and then while we rested we watched the laborious ant at his work i found nothing new in him certainly nothing to change my opinion of him it seems to me that in the matter of intellect the ant must be a strangely overrated bird during many summers now i have watched him when i ought to have been in better business and i have not yet come across a living ant that seemed to have any more sense than a dead one i refer to the ordinary ant of course i have had no experience of those wonderful swiss and african ones which vote keep drilled armies hold slaves and dispute about religion those particular ants may be all that the naturalist paints them but i am persuaded that the average ant is a sham i admit his industry of course he is the hardest working creature in the world when anybody is looking but his leather headedness is the point i make against him he goes out foraging he makes a capture and then what does he do go home no he goes anywhere but home he doesnt know where home is his home may be only three feet away no matter he cant find it he makes his capture as i have said it is generally something which can be of no sort of use to himself or anybody else it is usually seven times bigger than it ought to be he hunts out the awkwardest place to take hold of it he lifts it bodily up in the air by main force and starts not toward home but in the opposite direction not calmly and wisely but with a frantic haste which is wasteful of his strength he fetches up against a pebble and instead of going around it he climbs over it backward dragging his booty after him tumbles down on the other side jumps up in a passion kicks the dust off his clothes moistens his hands grabs his property viciously yanks it this way then that shoves it ahead of him a moment turns tail and lugs it after him another moment gets madder and madder then presently hoists it into the air and goes tearing away in an entirely new direction comes to a weed it never occurs to him to go around it no he must climb it and he does climb it dragging his worthless property to the top which is as bright a thing to do as it would be for me to carry a sack of flour from heidelberg to paris by way of strasburg steeple when he gets up there he finds that that is not the place takes a cursory glance at the scenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down and starts off once more as usual in a new direction at the end of half an hour he fetches up within six inches of the place he started from and lays his burden down meantime he has been over all the ground for two yards around and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across now he wipes the sweat from his brow strokes his limbs and then marches aimlessly off in as violently a hurry as ever he does not remember to have ever seen it before he looks around to see which is not the way home grabs his bundle and starts he goes through the same adventures he had before finally stops to rest and a friend comes along evidently the friend remarks that a last years grasshopper leg is a very noble acquisition and inquires where he got it evidently the proprietor does not remember exactly where he did get it but thinks he got it around here somewhere evidently the friend contracts to help him freight it home then with a judgment peculiarly antic pun not intended they take hold of opposite ends of that grasshopper leg and begin to tug with all their might in opposite directions presently they take a rest and confer together they decide that something is wrong they cant make out what then they go at it again just as before same result mutual recriminations follow evidently each accuses the other of being an obstructionist they lock themselves together and chew each others jaws for a while then they roll and tumble on the ground till one loses a horn or a leg and has to haul off for repairs they make up and go to work again in the same old insane way but the crippled ant is at a disadvantage tug as he may the other one drags off the booty and him at the end of it instead of giving up he hangs on and gets his shins bruised against every obstruction that comes in the way by and by when that grasshopper leg has been dragged all over the same old ground once more it is finally dumped at about the spot where it originally lay the two perspiring ants inspect it thoughtfully and decide that dried grasshopper legs are a poor sort of property after all and then each starts off in a different direction to see if he cant find an old nail or something else that is heavy enough to afford entertainment and at the same time valueless enough to make an ant want to own it there in the black forest on the mountainside i saw an ant go through with such a performance as this with a dead spider of fully ten times his own weight the spider was not quite dead but too far gone to resist he had a round body the size of a pea the little ant observing that i was noticing turned him on his back sunk his fangs into his throat lifted him into the air and started vigorously off with him stumbling over little pebbles stepping on the spiders legs and tripping himself up dragging him backward shoving him bodily ahead dragging him up stones six inches high instead of going around them climbing weeds twenty times his own height and jumping from their summits and finally leaving him in the middle of the road to be confiscated by any other fool of an ant that wanted him i measured the ground which this ass traversed and arrived at the conclusion that what he had accomplished inside of twenty minutes would constitute some such job as this relatively speaking for a man to wit to strap two eight hundred pound horses together carry them eighteen hundred feet mainly over not around boulders averaging six feet high and in the course of the journey climb up and jump from the top of one precipice like niagara and three steeples each a hundred and twenty feet high and then put the horses down in an exposed place without anybody to watch them and go off to indulge in some other idiotic miracle for vanitys sake science has recently discovered that the ant does not lay up anything for winter use this will knock him out of literature to some extent he does not work except when people are looking and only then when the observer has a green naturalistic look and seems to be taking notes this amounts to deception and will injure him for the sunday schools he has not judgment enough to know what is good to eat from what isnt this amounts to ignorance and will impair the worlds respect for him he cannot stroll around a stump and find his way home again this amounts to idiocy and once the damaging fact is established thoughtful people will cease to look up to him the sentimental will cease to fondle him his vaunted industry is but a vanity and of no effect since he never gets home with anything he starts with this disposes of the last remnant of his reputation and wholly destroys his main usefulness as a moral agent since it will make the sluggard hesitate to go to him any more it is strange beyond comprehension that so manifest a humbug as the ant has been able to fool so many nations and keep it up so many ages without being found out the ant is strong but we saw another strong thing where we had not suspected the presence of much muscular power before a toadstool that vegetable which springs to full growth in a single night had torn loose and lifted a matted mass of pine needles and dirt of twice its own bulk into the air and supported it there like a column supporting a shed ten thousand toadstools with the right purchase could lift a man i suppose but what good would it do all our afternoons progress had been uphill about five or half past we reached the summit and all of a sudden the dense curtain of the forest parted and we looked down into a deep and beautiful gorge and out over a wide panorama of wooded mountains with their summits shining in the sun and their glade furrowed sides dimmed with purple shade the gorge under our feet called allerheiligen afforded room in the grassy level at its head for a cozy and delightful human nest shut away from the world and its botherations and consequently the monks of the old times had not failed to spy it out and here were the brown and comely ruins of their church and convent to prove that priests had as fine an instinct seven hundred years ago in ferreting out the choicest nooks and corners in a land as priests have today a big hotel crowds the ruins a little now and drives a brisk trade with summer tourists we descended into the gorge and had a supper which would have been very satisfactory if the trout had not been boiled the germans are pretty sure to boil a trout or anything else if left to their own devices this is an argument of some value in support of the theory that they were the original colonists of the wild islands of the coast of scotland a schooner laden with oranges was wrecked upon one of those islands a few years ago and the gentle savages rendered the captain such willing assistance that he gave them as many oranges as they wanted next day he asked them how they liked them they shook their heads and said baked they were tough and even boiled they warnt things for a hungry man to hanker after we went down the glen after supper it is beautiful a mixture of sylvan loveliness and craggy wildness a limpid torrent goes whistling down the glen and toward the foot of it winds through a narrow cleft between lofty precipices and hurls itself over a succession of falls after one passes the last of these he has a backward glimpse at the falls which is very pleasing they rise in a seven stepped stairway of foamy and glittering cascades and make a picture which is as charming as it is unusual chapter xxiii nicodemus dodge and the skeleton we were satisfied that we could walk to oppenau in one day now that we were in practice so we set out the next morning after breakfast determined to do it it was all the way downhill and we had the loveliest summer weather for it so we set the pedometer and then stretched away on an easy regular stride down through the cloven forest drawing in the fragrant breath of the morning in deep refreshing draughts and wishing we might never have anything to do forever but walk to oppenau and keep on doing it and then doing it over again now the true charm of pedestrianism does not lie in the walking or in the scenery but in the talking the walking is good to time the movement of the tongue by and to keep the blood and the brain stirred up and active the scenery and the woodsy smells are good to bear in upon a man an unconscious and unobtrusive charm and solace to eye and soul and sense but the supreme pleasure comes from the talk it is no matter whether one talks wisdom or nonsense the case is the same the bulk of the enjoyment lies in the wagging of the gladsome jaw and the flapping of the sympathetic ear and what motley variety of subjects a couple of people will casually rake over in the course of a days tramp there being no constraint a change of subject is always in order and so a body is not likely to keep pegging at a single topic until it grows tiresome we discussed everything we knew during the first fifteen or twenty minutes that morning and then branched out into the glad free boundless realm of the things we were not certain about harris said that if the best writer in the world once got the slovenly habit of doubling up his haves he could never get rid of it while he lived that is to say if a man gets the habit of saying i should have liked to have known more about it instead of saying simply and sensibly i should have liked to know more about it that mans disease is incurable harris said that his sort of lapse is to be found in every copy of every newspaper that has ever been printed in english and in almost all of our books he said he had observed it in kirkhams grammar and in macaulay harris believed that milk teeth are commoner in mens mouths than those doubled up haves i do not know that there have not been moments in the course of the present session when i should have been very glad to have accepted the proposal of my noble friend and to have exchanged parts in some of our evenings of work from a speech of the english chancellor of the exchequer august that changed the subject to dentistry i said i believed the average man dreaded tooth pulling more than amputation and that he would yell quicker under the former operation than he would under the latter the philosopher harris said that the average man would not yell in either case if he had an audience then he continued when our brigade first went into camp on the potomac we used to be brought up standing occasionally by an ear splitting howl of anguish that meant that a soldier was getting a tooth pulled in a tent but the surgeons soon changed that they instituted open air dentistry there never was a howl afterward that is from the man who was having the tooth pulled at the daily dental hour there would always be about five hundred soldiers gathered together in the neighborhood of that dental chair waiting to see the performance and help and the moment the surgeon took a grip on the candidates tooth and began to lift every one of those five hundred rascals would clap his hand to his jaw and begin to hop around on one leg and howl with all the lungs he had it was enough to raise your hair to hear that variegated and enormous unanimous caterwaul burst out with so big and so derisive an audience as that a sufferer wouldnt emit a sound though you pulled his head off the surgeons said that pretty often a patient was compelled to laugh in the midst of his pangs but that they had never caught one crying out after the open air exhibition was instituted dental surgeons suggested doctors doctors suggested death death suggested skeletons and so by a logical process the conversation melted out of one of these subjects and into the next until the topic of skeletons raised up nicodemus dodge out of the deep grave in my memory where he had lain buried and forgotten for twenty five years when i was a boy in a printing office in missouri a loose jointed long legged tow headed jeans clad countrified cub of about sixteen lounged in one day and without removing his hands from the depths of his trousers pockets or taking off his faded ruin of a slouch hat whose broken rim hung limp and ragged about his eyes and ears like a bug eaten cabbage leaf stared indifferently around then leaned his hip against the editors table crossed his mighty brogans aimed at a distant fly from a crevice in his upper teeth laid him low and said with composure whars the boss i am the boss said the editor following this curious bit of architecture wonderingly along up to its clock face with his eye dont want anybody fur to learn the business taint likely well i dont know would you like to learn it paps so po he caint

you ll do nicodemus we ll give you a trial anyway all right when would you like to begin now so within ten minutes after we had first glimpsed this nondescript he was one of us and with his coat off and hard at it beyond that end of our establishment which was furthest from the street was a deserted garden pathless and thickly grown with the bloomy and villainous jimpson weed and its common friend the stately sunflower in the midst of this mournful spot was a decayed and aged little frame house with but one room one window and no ceiling it had been a smoke house a generation before nicodemus was given this lonely and ghostly den as a bedchamber the village smarties recognized a treasure in nicodemus right away a butt to play jokes on it was easy to see that he was inconceivably green and confiding george jones had the glory of perpetrating the first joke on him he gave him a cigar with a firecracker in it and winked to the crowd to come the thing exploded presently and swept away the bulk of nicodemuss eyebrows and eyelashes he simply said i consider them kind of seeg yars dangersome and seemed to suspect nothing the next evening nicodemus waylaid george and poured a bucket of ice water over him one day while nicodemus was in swimming tom mcelroy tied his clothes nicodemus made a bonfire of toms by way of retaliation a third joke was played upon nicodemus a day or two later he walked up the middle aisle of the village church sunday night with a staring handbill pinned between his shoulders the joker spent the remainder of the night after church in the cellar of a deserted house and nicodemus sat on the cellar door till toward breakfast time to make sure that the prisoner remembered that if any noise was made some rough treatment would be the consequence the cellar had two feet of stagnant water in it and was bottomed with six inches of soft mud but i wander from the point it was the subject of skeletons that brought this boy back to my recollection before a very long time had elapsed the village smarties began to feel an uncomfortable consciousness of not having made a very shining success out of their attempts on the simpleton from old shelby experimenters grew scarce and chary now the young doctor came to the rescue there was delight and applause when he proposed to scare nicodemus to death and explained how he was going to do it he had a noble new skeleton the skeleton of the late and only local celebrity jimmy finn the village drunkard a grisly piece of property which he had bought of jimmy finn himself at auction for fifty dollars under great competition when jimmy lay very sick in the tan yard a fortnight before his death the fifty dollars had gone promptly for whiskey and had considerably hurried up the change of ownership in the skeleton the doctor would put jimmy finns skeleton in nicodemuss bed this was done about half past ten in the evening about nicodemuss usual bedtime midnight the village jokers came creeping stealthily through the jimpson weeds and sunflowers toward the lonely frame den they reached the window and peeped in there sat the long legged pauper on his bed in a very short shirt and nothing more he was dangling his legs contentedly back and forth and wheezing the music of camptown races out of a paper overlaid comb which he was pressing against his mouth by him lay a new jewsharp a new top and solid india rubber ball a handful of painted marbles five pounds of store candy and a well gnawed slab of gingerbread as big and as thick as a volume of sheet music he had sold the skeleton to a traveling quack for three dollars and was enjoying the result just as we had finished talking about skeletons and were drifting into the subject of fossils harris and i heard a shout and glanced up the steep hillside we saw men and women standing away up there looking frightened and there was a bulky object tumbling and floundering down the steep slope toward us we got out of the way and when the object landed in the road it proved to be a boy he had tripped and fallen and there was nothing for him to do but trust to luck and take what might come when one starts to roll down a place like that there is no stopping till the bottom is reached think of people farming on a slant which is so steep that the best you can say of it if you want to be fastidiously accurate is that it is a little steeper than a ladder and not quite so steep as a mansard roof but that is what they do some of the little farms on the hillside opposite heidelberg were stood up edgeways the boy was wonderfully jolted up and his head was bleeding from cuts which it had got from small stones on the way harris and i gathered him up and set him on a stone and by that time the men and women had scampered down and brought his cap men women and children flocked out from neighboring cottages and joined the crowd the pale boy was petted and stared at and commiserated and water was brought for him to drink and bathe his bruises in and such another clatter of tongues all who had seen the catastrophe were describing it at once and each trying to talk louder than his neighbor and one youth of a superior genius ran a little way up the hill called attention tripped fell rolled down among us and thus triumphantly showed exactly how the thing had been done harris and i were included in all the descriptions how we were coming along how hans gross shouted how we looked up startled how we saw peter coming like a cannon shot how judiciously we got out of the way and let him come and with what presence of mind we picked him up and brushed him off and set him on a rock when the performance was over we were as much heroes as anybody else except peter and were so recognized we were taken with peter and the populace to peters mothers cottage and there we ate bread and cheese and drank milk and beer with everybody and had a most sociable good time and when we left we had a handshake all around and were receiving and shouting back leb wohls until a turn in the road separated us from our cordial and kindly new friends forever we accomplished our undertaking at half past eight in the evening we stepped into oppenau just eleven hours and a half out of allerheiligen one hundred and forty six miles this is the distance by pedometer the guide book and the imperial ordinance maps make it only ten and a quarter a surprising blunder for these two authorities are usually singularly accurate in the matter of distances chapter xxiv i protect the empress of germany that was a thoroughly satisfactory walk and the only one we were ever to have which was all the way downhill we took the train next morning and returned to baden baden through fearful fogs of dust every seat was crowded too for it was sunday and consequently everybody was taking a pleasure excursion hot the sky was an oven and a sound one too with no cracks in it to let in any air an odd time for a pleasure excursion certainly sunday is the great day on the continent the free day the happy day one can break the sabbath in a hundred ways without committing any sin we do not work on sunday because the commandment forbids it the germans do not work on sunday because the commandment forbids it we rest on sunday because the commandment requires it the germans rest on sunday because the commandment requires it but in the definition of the word rest lies all the difference with us its sunday meaning is stay in the house and keep still with the germans its sunday and week day meanings seem to be the same rest the tired part and never mind the other parts of the frame rest the tired part and use the means best calculated to rest that particular part thus if ones duties have kept him in the house all the week it will rest him to be out on sunday if his duties have required him to read weighty and serious matter all the week it will rest him to read light matter on sunday if his occupation has busied him with death and funerals all the week it will rest him to go to the theater sunday night and put in two or three hours laughing at a comedy if he is tired with digging ditches or felling trees all the week it will rest him to lie quiet in the house on sunday if the hand the arm the brain the tongue or any other member is fatigued with inanition it is not to be rested by addeding a days inanition but if a member is fatigued with exertion inanition is the right rest for it such is the way in which the germans seem to define the word rest that is to say they rest a member by recreating recuperating restoring its forces but our definition is less broad we all rest alike on sunday by secluding ourselves and keeping still whether that is the surest way to rest the most of us or not the germans make the actors the preachers etc work on sunday we encourage the preachers the editors the printers etc to work on sunday and imagine that none of the sin of it falls upon us but i do not know how we are going to get around the fact that if it is wrong for the printer to work at his trade on sunday it must be equally wrong for the preacher to work at his since the commandment has made no exception in his favor we buy monday mornings paper and read it and thus encourage sunday printing but i shall never do it again the germans remember the sabbath day to keep it holy by abstaining from work as commanded we keep it holy by abstaining from work as commanded and by also abstaining from play which is not commanded perhaps we constructively break the command to rest because the resting we do is in most cases only a name and not a fact these reasonings have sufficed in a measure to mend the rent in my conscience which i made by traveling to baden baden that sunday we arrived in time to furbish up and get to the english church before services began we arrived in considerable style too for the landlord had ordered the first carriage that could be found since there was no time to lose and our coachman was so splendidly liveried that we were probably mistaken for a brace of stray dukes why else were we honored with a pew all to ourselves away up among the very elect at the left of the chancel that was my first thought in the pew directly in front of us sat an elderly lady plainly and cheaply dressed at her side sat a young lady with a very sweet face and she also was quite simply dressed but around us and about us were clothes and jewels which it would do anybodys heart good to worship in i thought it was pretty manifest that the elderly lady was embarrassed at finding herself in such a conspicuous place arrayed in such cheap apparel i began to feel sorry for her and troubled about her she tried to seem very busy with her prayer book and her responses and unconscious that she was out of place but i said to myself she is not succeeding there is a distressed tremulousness in her voice which betrays increasing embarrassment presently the saviors name was mentioned and in her flurry she lost her head completely and rose and courtesied instead of making a slight nod as everybody else did the sympathetic blood surged to my temples and i turned and gave those fine birds what i intended to be a beseeching look but my feelings got the better of me and changed it into a look which said if any of you pets of fortune laugh at this poor soul you will deserve to be flayed for it things went from bad to worse and i shortly found myself mentally taking the unfriended lady under my protection my mind was wholly upon her i forgot all about the sermon her embarrassment took stronger and stronger hold upon her she got to snapping the lid of her smelling bottle it made a loud sharp sound but in her trouble she snapped and snapped away unconscious of what she was doing the last extremity was reached when the collection plate began its rounds the moderate people threw in pennies the nobles and the rich contributed silver but she laid a twenty mark gold piece upon the book rest before her with a sounding slap i said to myself she has parted with all her little hoard to buy the consideration of these unpitying people it is a sorrowful spectacle i did not venture to look around this time but as the service closed i said to myself let them laugh it is their opportunity but at the door of this church they shall see her step into our fine carriage with us and our gaudy coachman shall drive her home then she rose and all the congregation stood while she walked down the aisle she was the empress of germany no she had not been so much embarrassed as i had supposed my imagination had got started on the wrong scent and that is always hopeless one is sure then to go straight on misinterpreting everything clear through to the end the young lady with her imperial majesty was a maid of honor and i had been taking her for one of her boarders all the time this is the only time i have ever had an empress under my personal protection and considering my inexperience i wonder i got through with it so well i should have been a little embarrassed myself if i had known earlier what sort of a contract i had on my hands we found that the empress had been in baden baden several days it is said that she never attends any but the english form of church service i lay abed and read and rested from my journeys fatigues the remainder of that sunday but i sent my agent to represent me at the afternoon service for i never allow anything to interfere with my habit of attending church twice every sunday there was a vast crowd in the public grounds that night to hear the band play the fremersberg this piece tells one of the old legends of the region how a great noble of the middle ages got lost in the mountains and wandered about with his dogs in a violent storm until at last the faint tones of a monastery bell calling the monks to a midnight service caught his ear and he followed the direction the sounds came from and was saved a beautiful air ran through the music without ceasing sometimes loud and strong sometimes so soft that it could hardly be distinguished but it was always there it swung grandly along through the shrill whistling of the storm wind the rattling patter of the rain and the boom and crash of the thunder it wound soft and low through the lesser sounds the distant ones such as the throbbing of the convent bell the melodious winding of the hunters horn the distressed bayings of his dogs and the solemn chanting of the monks it rose again with a jubilant ring and mingled itself with the country songs and dances of the peasants assembled in the convent hall to cheer up the rescued huntsman while he ate his supper the instruments imitated all these sounds with a marvelous exactness more than one man started to raise his umbrella when the storm burst forth and the sheets of mimic rain came driving by it was hardly possible to keep from putting your hand to your hat when the fierce wind began to rage and shriek and it was not possible to refrain from starting when those sudden and charmingly real thunder crashes were let loose i suppose the fremersberg is a very low grade music i know indeed that it must be low grade music because it delighted me warmed me moved me stirred me uplifted me enraptured me that i was full of cry all the time and mad with enthusiasm my soul had never had such a scouring out since i was born the solemn and majestic chanting of the monks was not done by instruments but by mens voices and it rose and fell and rose again in that rich confusion of warring sounds and pulsing bells and the stately swing of that ever present enchanting air and it seemed to me that nothing but the very lowest of low grade music could be so divinely beautiful the great crowd which the fremersberg had called out was another evidence that it was low grade music for only the few are educated up to a point where high grade music gives pleasure i have never heard enough classic music to be able to enjoy it i dislike the opera because i want to love it and cant i suppose there are two kinds of music one kind which one feels just as an oyster might and another sort which requires a higher faculty a faculty which must be assisted and developed by teaching yet if base music gives certain of us wings why should we want any other but we do we want it because the higher and better like it we want it without giving it the necessary time and trouble so we climb into that upper tier that dress circle by a lie we pretend we like it i know several of that sort of people and i propose to be one of them myself when i get home with my fine european education and then there is painting what a red rag is to a bull turners slave ship was to me before i studied art mr ruskin is educated in art up to a point where that picture throws him into as mad an ecstasy of pleasure as it used to throw me into one of rage last year when i was ignorant his cultivation enables him and me now to see water in that glaring yellow mud and natural effects in those lurid explosions of mixed smoke and flame and crimson sunset glories it reconciles him and me now to the floating of iron cable chains and other unfloatable things it reconciles us to fishes swimming around on top of the mud i mean the water the most of the picture is a manifest impossibility that is to say a lie and only rigid cultivation can enable a man to find truth in a lie but it enabled mr ruskin to do it and it has enabled me to do it and i am thankful for it a boston newspaper reporter went and took a look at the slave ship floundering about in that fierce conflagration of reds and yellows and said it reminded him of a tortoise shell cat having a fit in a platter of tomatoes in my then uneducated state that went home to my non cultivation and i thought here is a man with an unobstructed eye mr ruskin would have said this person is an ass that is what i would say now months after this was written i happened into the national gallery in london and soon became so fascinated with the turner pictures that i could hardly get away from the place i went there often afterward meaning to see the rest of the gallery but the turner spell was too strong it could not be shaken off however the turners which attracted me most did not remind me of the slave ship however our business in baden baden this time was to join our courier i had thought it best to hire one as we should be in italy by and by and we did not know the language neither did he we found him at the hotel ready to take charge of us i asked him if he was all fixed he said he was that was very true he had a trunk two small satchels and an umbrella i was to pay him fifty five dollars a month and railway fares on the continent the railway fare on a trunk is about the same it is on a man couriers do not have to pay any board and lodging this seems a great saving to the tourist at first it does not occur to the tourist that somebody pays that mans board and lodging it occurs to him by and by however in one of his lucid moments chapter xxv hunted by the little chamois next morning we left in the train for switzerland and reached lucerne about ten o clock at night the first discovery i made was that the beauty of the lake had not been exaggerated within a day or two i made another discovery this was that the lauded chamois is not a wild goat that it is not a horned animal that it is not shy that it does not avoid human society and that there is no peril in hunting it the chamois is a black or brown creature no bigger than a mustard seed you do not have to go after it it comes after you it arrives in vast herds and skips and scampers all over your body inside your clothes thus it is not shy but extremely sociable it is not afraid of man on the contrary it will attack him its bite is not dangerous but neither is it pleasant its activity has not been overstated if you try to put your finger on it it will skip a thousand times its own length at one jump and no eye is sharp enough to see where it lights a great deal of romantic nonsense has been written about the swiss chamois and the perils of hunting it whereas the truth is that even women and children hunt it and fearlessly indeed everybody hunts it the hunting is going on all the time day and night in bed and out of it it is poetic foolishness to hunt it with a gun very few people do that there is not one man in a million who can hit it with a gun it is much easier to catch it than it is to shoot it and only the experienced chamois hunter can do either another common piece of exaggeration is that about the scarcity of the chamois it is the reverse of scarce droves of one hundred million chamois are not unusual in the swiss hotels indeed they are so numerous as to be a great pest the romancers always dress up the chamois hunter in a fanciful and picturesque costume whereas the best way to hunt this game is to do it without any costume at all the article of commerce called chamois skin is another fraud nobody could skin a chamois it is too small the creature is a humbug in every way and everything which has been written about it is sentimental exaggeration it was no pleasure to me to find the chamois out for he had been one of my pet illusions all my life it had been my dream to see him in his native wilds some day and engage in the adventurous sport of chasing him from cliff to cliff it is no pleasure to me to expose him now and destroy the readers delight in him and respect for him but still it must be done for when an honest writer discovers an imposition it is his simple duty to strip it bare and hurl it down from its place of honor no matter who suffers by it any other course would render him unworthy of the public confidence lucerne is a charming place it begins at the waters edge with a fringe of hotels and scrambles up and spreads itself over two or three sharp hills in a crowded disorderly but picturesque way offering to the eye a heaped up confusion of red roofs quaint gables dormer windows toothpick steeples with here and there a bit of ancient embattled wall bending itself over the ridges worm fashion and here and there an old square tower of heavy masonry and also here and there a town clock with only one hand a hand which stretches across the dial and has no joint in it such a clock helps out the picture but you cannot tell the time of day by it between the curving line of hotels and the lake is a broad avenue with lamps and a double rank of low shade trees the lake front is walled with masonry like a pier and has a railing to keep people from walking overboard all day long the vehicles dash along the avenue and nurses children and tourists sit in the shade of the trees or lean on the railing and watch the schools of fishes darting about in the clear water or gaze out over the lake at the stately border of snow hooded mountain peaks little pleasure steamers black with people are coming and going all the time and everywhere one sees young girls and young men paddling about in fanciful rowboats or skimming along by the help of sails when there is any wind the front rooms of the hotels have little railed balconies where one may take his private luncheon in calm cool comfort and look down upon this busy and pretty scene and enjoy it without having to do any of the work connected with it most of the people both male and female are in walking costume and carry alpenstocks evidently it is not considered safe to go about in switzerland even in town without an alpenstock if the tourist forgets and comes down to breakfast without his alpenstock he goes back and gets it and stands it up in the corner when his touring in switzerland is finished he does not throw that broomstick away but lugs it home with him to the far corners of the earth although this costs him more trouble and bother than a baby or a courier could you see the alpenstock is his trophy his name is burned upon it and if he has climbed a hill or jumped a brook or traversed a brickyard with it he has the names of those places burned upon it too thus it is his regimental flag so to speak and bears the record of his achievements it is worth three francs when he buys it but a bonanza could not purchase it after his great deeds have been inscribed upon it there are artisans all about switzerland whose trade it is to burn these things upon the alpenstock of the tourist and observe a man is respected in switzerland according to his alpenstock i found i could get no attention there while i carried an unbranded one however branding is not expected so i soon remedied that the effect upon the next detachment of tourists was very marked i felt repaid for my trouble half of the summer horde in switzerland is made up of english people the other half is made up of many nationalities the germans leading and the americans coming next the americans were not as numerous as i had expected they would be the seven thirty table dh te at the great schweitzerhof furnished a mighty array and variety of nationalities but it offered a better opportunity to observe costumes than people for the multitude sat at immensely long tables and therefore the faces were mainly seen in perspective but the breakfasts were served at small round tables and then if one had the fortune to get a table in the midst of the assemblage he could have as many faces to study as he could desire we used to try to guess out the nationalities and generally succeeded tolerably well sometimes we tried to guess peoples names but that was a failure that is a thing which probably requires a good deal of practice we presently dropped it and gave our efforts to less difficult particulars one morning i said there is an american party harris said yes but name the state i named one state harris named another we agreed upon one thing however that the young girl with the party was very beautiful and very tastefully dressed but we disagreed as to her age i said she was eighteen harris said she was twenty the dispute between us waxed warm and i finally said with a pretense of being in earnest well there is one way to settle the matter i will go and ask her harris said sarcastically certainly that is the thing to do all you need to do is to use the common formula over here go and say im an american of course she will be glad to see you then he hinted that perhaps there was no great danger of my venturing to speak to her i said i was only talking i didnt intend to approach her but i see that you do not know what an intrepid person i am i am not afraid of any woman that walks i will go and speak to this young girl the thing i had in my mind was not difficult i meant to address her in the most respectful way and ask her to pardon me if her strong resemblance to a former acquaintance of mine was deceiving me and when she should reply that the name i mentioned was not the name she bore i meant to beg pardon again most respectfully and retire there would be no harm done i walked to her table bowed to the gentleman then turned to her and was about to begin my little speech when she exclaimed i knew i wasnt mistaken i told john it was you john said it probably wasnt but i knew i was right i said you would recognize me presently and come over and im glad you did for i shouldnt have felt much flattered if you had gone out of this room without recognizing me sit down sit down how odd it is you are the last person i was ever expecting to see again this was a stupefying surprise it took my wits clear away for an instant however we shook hands cordially all around and i sat down but truly this was the tightest place i ever was in i seemed to vaguely remember the girls face now but i had no idea where i had seen it before or what name belonged with it i immediately tried to get up a diversion about swiss scenery to keep her from launching into topics that might betray that i did not know her but it was of no use she went right along upon matters which interested her more oh dear what a night that was when the sea washed the forward boats away do you remember it oh dont i said i but i didnt i wished the sea had washed the rudder and the smoke stack and the captain away then i could have located this questioner and dont you remember how frightened poor mary was and how she cried indeed i do said i dear me how it all comes back i fervently wished it would come back but my memory was a blank the wise way would have been to frankly own up but i could not bring myself to do that after the young girl had praised me so for recognizing her so i went on deeper and deeper into the mire hoping for a chance clue but never getting one the unrecognizable continued with vivacity do you know george married mary after all why no did he indeed he did he said he did not believe she was half as much to blame as her father was and i thought he was right didnt you of course he was it was a perfectly plain case i always said so why no you didnt at least that summer oh no not that summer no you are perfectly right about that it was the following winter that i said it well as it turned out mary was not in the least to blame it was all her fathers fault at least his and old darleys it was necessary to say something so i said i always regarded darley as a troublesome old thing so he was but then they always had a great affection for him although he had so many eccentricities you remember that when the weather was the least cold he would try to come into the house i was rather afraid to proceed evidently darley was not a man he must be some other kind of animal possibly a dog maybe an elephant however tails are common to all animals so i ventured to say and what a tail he had one he had a thousand this was bewildering i did not quite know what to say so i only said yes he was rather well fixed in the matter of tails for a negro and a crazy one at that i should say he was said she it was getting pretty sultry for me i said to myself is it possible she is going to stop there and wait for me to speak if she does the conversation is blocked a negro with a thousand tails is a topic which a person cannot talk upon fluently and instructively without more or less preparation as to diving rashly into such a vast subject but here to my gratitude she interrupted my thoughts by saying yes when it came to tales of his crazy woes there was simply no end to them if anybody would listen his own quarters were comfortable enough but when the weather was cold the family were sure to have his company nothing could keep him out of the house but they always bore it kindly because he had saved toms life years before you remember tom oh perfectly fine fellow he was too yes he was and what a pretty little thing his child was you may well say that i never saw a prettier child i used to delight to pet it and dandle it and play with it so did i you named it what was that name i cant call it to mind it appeared to me that the ice was getting pretty thin here i would have given something to know what the childs was however i had the good luck to think of a name that would fit either sex so i brought it out i named it frances from a relative i suppose but you named the one that died too one that i never saw what did you call that one i was out of neutral names but as the child was dead and she had never seen it i thought i might risk a name for it and trust to luck therefore i said i called that one thomas henry she said musingly that is very singular very singular i sat still and let the cold sweat run down i was in a good deal of trouble but i believed i could worry through if she wouldnt ask me to name any more children i wondered where the lightning was going to strike next she was still ruminating over that last childs title but presently she said i have always been sorry you were away at the time i would have had you name my child your child are you married i have been married thirteen years christened you mean no married the youth by your side is my son it seems incredible even impossible i do not mean any harm by it but would you mind telling me if you are any over eighteen that is to say will you tell me how old you are i was just nineteen the day of the storm we were talking about that was my birthday that did not help matters much as i did not know the date of the storm i tried to think of some non committal thing to say to keep up my end of the talk and render my poverty in the matter of reminiscences as little noticeable as possible but i seemed to be about out of non committal things i was about to say you havent changed a bit since then but that was risky i thought of saying you have improved ever so much since then but that wouldnt answer of course i was about to try a shy at the weather for a saving change when the girl slipped in ahead of me and said how i have enjoyed this talk over those happy old times havent you i never have spent such a half hour in all my life before said i with emotion and i could have added with a near approach to truth and i would rather be scalped than spend another one like it i was holily grateful to be through with the ordeal and was about to make my good bys and get out when the girl said but there is one thing that is ever so puzzling to me why what is that that dead childs name what did you say it was here was another balmy place to be in i had forgotten the childs name i hadnt imagined it would be needed again however i had to pretend to know anyway so i said joseph william the youth at my side corrected me and said no thomas henry i thanked him in words and said with trepidation o yes i was thinking of another child that i named i have named a great many and i get them confused this one was named henry thompson thomas henry calmly interposed the boy i thanked him again strictly in words and stammered out thomas henry yes thomas henry was the poor childs name i named him for thomas er thomas carlyle the great author you know and henry er er henry the eighth the parents were very grateful to have a child named thomas henry that makes it more singular than ever murmured my beautiful friend does it why because when the parents speak of that child now they always call it susan amelia that spiked my gun i could not say anything i was entirely out of verbal obliquities to go further would be to lie and that i would not do so i simply sat still and suffered sat mutely and resignedly there and sizzled for i was being slowly fried to death in my own blushes presently the enemy laughed a happy laugh and said i have enjoyed this talk over old times but you have not i saw very soon that you were only pretending to know me and so as i had wasted a compliment on you in the beginning i made up my mind to punish you and i have succeeded pretty well i was glad to see that you knew george and tom and darley for i had never heard of them before and therefore could not be sure that you had and i was glad to learn the names of those imaginary children too one can get quite a fund of information out of you if one goes at it cleverly mary and the storm and the sweeping away of the forward boats were facts all the rest was fiction mary was my sister her full name was mary now do you remember me yes i said i do remember you now and you are as hard headed as you were thirteen years ago in that ship else you wouldnt have punished me so you havent changed your nature nor your person in any way at all you look as young as you did then you are just as beautiful as you were then and you have transmitted a deal of your comeliness to this fine boy there if that speech moves you any lets fly the flag of truce with the understanding that i am conquered and confess it all of which was agreed to and accomplished on the spot when i went back to harris i said now you see what a person with talent and address can do excuse me i see what a person of colossal ignorance and simplicity can do the idea of your going and intruding on a party of strangers that way and talking for half an hour why i never heard of a man in his right mind doing such a thing before what did you say to them i never said any harm i merely asked the girl what her name was i dont doubt it upon my word i dont i think you were capable of it it was stupid in me to let you go over there and make such an exhibition of yourself but you know i couldnt really believe you would do such an inexcusable thing what will those people think of us but how did you say it i mean the manner of it i hope you were not abrupt no i was careful about that i said my friend and i would like to know what your name is if you dont mind no that was not abrupt there is a polish about it that does you infinite credit and i am glad you put me in that was a delicate attention which i appreciate at its full value what did she do she didnt do anything in particular she told me her name simply told you her name do you mean to say she did not show any surprise well now i come to think she did show something maybe it was surprise i hadnt thought of that i took it for gratification oh undoubtedly you were right it must have been gratification it could not be otherwise than gratifying to be assaulted by a stranger with such a question as that then what did you do i offered my hand and the party gave me a shake i saw it i did not believe my own eyes at the time did the gentleman say anything about cutting your throat no they all seemed glad to see me as far as i could judge and do you know i believe they were i think they said to themselves doubtless this curiosity has got away from his keeper let us amuse ourselves with him there is no other way of accounting for their facile docility you sat down did they ask you to sit down no they did not ask me but i suppose they did not think of it you have an unerring instinct what else did you do what did you talk about well i asked the girl how old she was undoubtedly your delicacy is beyond praise go on go on dont mind my apparent misery i always look so when i am steeped in a profound and reverent joy go on she told you her age yes she told me her age and all about her mother and her grandmother and her other relations and all about herself did she volunteer these statistics no not exactly that i asked the questions and she answered them this is divine go on it is not possible that you forgot to inquire into her politics no i thought of that she is a democrat her husband is a republican and both of them are baptists her husband is that child married she is not a child she is married and that is her husband who is there with her has she any children yes seven and a half that is impossible no she has them she told me herself well but seven and a half how do you make out the half where does the half come in there is a child which she had by another husband not this one but another one so it is a stepchild and they do not count in full measure another husband has she another husband yes four this one is number four i dont believe a word of it it is impossible upon its face is that boy there her brother no that is her son he is her youngest he is not as old as he looked he is only eleven and a half these things are all manifestly impossible this is a wretched business it is a plain case they simply took your measure and concluded to fill you up they seem to have succeeded i am glad i am not in the mess they may at least be charitable enough to think there aint a pair of us are they going to stay here long no they leave before noon there is one man who is deeply grateful for that how did you find out you asked i suppose no along at first i inquired into their plans in a general way and they said they were going to be here a week and make trips round about but toward the end of the interview when i said you and i would tour around with them with pleasure and offered to bring you over and introduce you they hesitated a little and asked if you were from the same establishment that i was i said you were and then they said they had changed their mind and considered it necessary to start at once and visit a sick relative in siberia ah me you struck the summit you struck the loftiest altitude of stupidity that human effort has ever reached you shall have a monument of jackasses skulls as high as the strasburg spire if you die before i do they wanted to know i was from the same establishment that you hailed from did they what did they mean by establishment i dont know it never occurred to me to ask well i know they meant an asylum an idiot asylum do you understand so they do think theres a pair of us after all now what do you think of yourself well i dont know i didnt know i was doing any harm i didnt mean to do any harm they were very nice people and they seemed to like me harris made some rude remarks and left for his bedroom to break some furniture he said he was a singularly irascible man any little thing would disturb his temper i had been well scorched by the young woman but no matter i took it out on harris one should always get even in some way else the sore place will go on hurting chapter xxvi the nest of the cuckoo clock the hofkirche is celebrated for its organ concerts all summer long the tourists flock to that church about six o clock in the evening and pay their franc and listen to the noise they dont stay to hear all of it but get up and tramp out over the sounding stone floor meeting late comers who tramp in in a sounding and vigorous way this tramping back and forth is kept up nearly all the time and is accented by the continuous slamming of the door and the coughing and barking and sneezing of the crowd meantime the big organ is booming and crashing and thundering away doing its best to prove that it is the biggest and best organ in europe and that a tight little box of a church is the most favorable place to average and appreciate its powers in it is true there were some soft and merciful passages occasionally but the tramp tramp of the tourists only allowed one to get fitful glimpses of them so to speak then right away the organist would let go another avalanche the commerce of lucerne consists mainly in gimcrackery of the souvenir sort the shops are packed with alpine crystals photographs of scenery and wooden and ivory carvings i will not conceal the fact that miniature figures of the lion of lucerne are to be had in them millions of them but they are libels upon him every one of them there is a subtle something about the majestic pathos of the original which the copyist cannot get even the sun fails to get it both the photographer and the carver give you a dying lion and that is all the shape is right the attitude is right the proportions are right but that indescribable something which makes the lion of lucerne the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world is wanting the lion lies in his lair in the perpendicular face of a low cliff for he is carved from the living rock of the cliff his size is colossal his attitude is noble his head is bowed the broken spear is sticking in his shoulder his protecting paw rests upon the lilies of france vines hang down the cliff and wave in the wind and a clear stream trickles from above and empties into a pond at the base and in the smooth surface of the pond the lion is mirrored among the water lilies around about are green trees and grass the place is a sheltered reposeful woodland nook remote from noise and stir and confusion and all this is fitting for lions do die in such places and not on granite pedestals in public squares fenced with fancy iron railings the lion of lucerne would be impressive anywhere but nowhere so impressive as where he is martyrdom is the luckiest fate that can befall some people louis xvi did not die in his bed consequently history is very gentle with him she is charitable toward his failings and she finds in him high virtues which are not usually considered to be virtues when they are lodged in kings she makes him out to be a person with a meek and modest spirit the heart of a female saint and a wrong head none of these qualities are kingly but the last taken together they make a character which would have fared harshly at the hands of history if its owner had had the ill luck to miss martyrdom with the best intentions to do the right thing he always managed to do the wrong one moreover nothing could get the female saint out of him he knew well enough that in national emergencies he must not consider how he ought to act as a man but how he ought to act as a king so he honestly tried to sink the man and be the king but it was a failure he only succeeded in being the female saint he was not instant in season but out of season he could not be persuaded to do a thing while it could do any good he was iron he was adamant in his stubbornness then but as soon as the thing had reached a point where it would be positively harmful to do it do it he would and nothing could stop him he did not do it because it would be harmful but because he hoped it was not yet too late to achieve by it the good which it would have done if applied earlier his comprehension was always a train or two behindhand if a national toe required amputating he could not see that it needed anything more than poulticing when others saw that the mortification had reached the knee he first perceived that the toe needed cutting off so he cut it off and he severed the leg at the knee when others saw that the disease had reached the thigh he was good and honest and well meaning in the matter of chasing national diseases but he never could overtake one as a private man he would have been lovable but viewed as a king he was strictly contemptible his was a most unroyal career but the most pitiable spectacle in it was his sentimental treachery to his swiss guard on that memorable th of august when he allowed those heroes to be massacred in his cause and forbade them to shed the sacred french blood purporting to be flowing in the veins of the red capped mob of miscreants that was raging around the palace he meant to be kingly but he was only the female saint once more some of his biographers think that upon this occasion the spirit of saint louis had descended upon him it must have found pretty cramped quarters if napoleon the first had stood in the shoes of louis xvi that day instead of being merely a casual and unknown looker on there would be no lion of lucerne now but there would be a well stocked communist graveyard in paris which would answer just as well to remember the th of august by martyrdom made a saint of mary queen of scots three hundred years ago and she has hardly lost all of her saintship yet martyrdom made a saint of the trivial and foolish marie antoinette and her biographers still keep her fragrant with the odor of sanctity to this day while unconsciously proving upon almost every page they write that the only calamitous instinct which her husband lacked she supplied the instinct to root out and get rid of an honest able and loyal official wherever she found him the hideous but beneficent french revolution would have been deferred or would have fallen short of completeness or even might not have happened at all if marie antoinette had made the unwise mistake of not being born the world owes a great deal to the french revolution and consequently to its two chief promoters louis the poor in spirit and his queen we did not buy any wooden images of the lion nor any ivory or ebony or marble or chalk or sugar or chocolate ones or even any photographic slanders of him the truth is these copies were so common so universal in the shops and everywhere that they presently became as intolerable to the wearied eye as the latest popular melody usually becomes to the harassed ear in lucerne too the wood carvings of other sorts which had been so pleasant to look upon when one saw them occasionally at home soon began to fatigue us we grew very tired of seeing wooden quails and chickens picking and strutting around clock faces and still more tired of seeing wooden images of the alleged chamois skipping about wooden rocks or lying upon them in family groups or peering alertly up from behind them the first day i would have bought a hundred and fifty of these clocks if i had the money and i did buy three but on the third day the disease had run its course i had convalesced and was in the market once more trying to sell however i had no luck which was just as well for the things will be pretty enough no doubt when i get them home for years my pet aversion had been the cuckoo clock now here i was at last right in the creatures home so wherever i went that distressing hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo was always in my ears for a nervous man this was a fine state of things some sounds are hatefuler than others but no sound is quite so inane and silly and aggravating as the hoo hoo of a cuckoo clock i think i bought one and am carrying it home to a certain person for i have always said that if the opportunity ever happened i would do that man an ill turn what i meant was that i would break one of his legs or something of that sort but in lucerne i instantly saw that i could impair his mind that would be more lasting and more satisfactory every way so i bought the cuckoo clock and if i ever get home with it he is my meat as they say in the mines i thought of another candidate a book reviewer whom i could name if i wanted to but after thinking it over i didnt buy him a clock i couldnt injure his mind we visited the two long covered wooden bridges which span the green and brilliant reuss just below where it goes plunging and hurrahing out of the lake these rambling sway backed tunnels are very attractive things with their alcoved outlooks upon the lovely and inspiriting water they contain two or three hundred queer old pictures by old swiss masters old boss sign painters who flourished before the decadence of art the lake is alive with fishes plainly visible to the eye for the water is very clear the parapets in front of the hotels were usually fringed with fishers of all ages one day i thought i would stop and see a fish caught the result brought back to my mind very forcibly a circumstance which i had not thought of before for twelve years this one the man who put up at gadsbys when my odd friend riley and i were newspaper correspondents in washington in the winter of we were coming down pennsylvania avenue one night near midnight in a driving storm of snow when the flash of a street lamp fell upon a man who was eagerly tearing along in the opposite direction this is lucky you are mr riley aint you riley was the most self possessed and solemnly deliberate person in the republic he stopped looked his man over from head to foot and finally said i am mr riley did you happen to be looking for me thats just what i was doing said the man joyously and its the biggest luck in the world that i ve found you my name is lykins im one of the teachers of the high school san francisco as soon as i heard the san francisco postmastership was vacant i made up my mind to get it and here i am yes said riley slowly as you have remarked mr lykins here you are and have you got it well not exactly got it but the next thing to it i ve brought a petition signed by the superintendent of public instruction and all the teachers and by more than two hundred other people now i want you if you ll be so good to go around with me to the pacific delegation for i want to rush this thing through and get along home if the matter is so pressing you will prefer that we visit the delegation tonight said riley in a voice which had nothing mocking in it to an unaccustomed ear oh tonight by all means i havent got any time to fool around i want their promise before i go to bed i aint the talking kind im the doing kind yes you ve come to the right place for that when did you arrive just an hour ago when are you intending to leave for new york tomorrow evening for san francisco next morning just so what are you going to do tomorrow do why i ve got to go to the president with the petition and the delegation and get the appointment havent i yes very true that is correct and then what executive session of the senate atp m got to get the appointment confirmed i reckon you ll grant that yes yes said riley meditatively you are right again then you take the train for new york in the evening and the steamer for san francisco next morning thats it thats the way i map it out riley considered a while and then said you couldnt stay a day well say two days longer bless your soul no its not my style i aint a man to go fooling around im a man that does things i tell you the storm was raging the thick snow blowing in gusts riley stood silent apparently deep in a reverie during a minute or more then he looked up and said have you ever heard about that man who put up at gadsbys once but i see you havent he backed mr lykins against an iron fence buttonholed him fastened him with his eye like the ancient mariner and proceeded to unfold his narrative as placidly and peacefully as if we were all stretched comfortably in a blossomy summer meadow instead of being persecuted by a wintry midnight tempest i will tell you about that man it was in jacksons time gadsbys was the principal hotel then well this man arrived from tennessee about nine o clock one morning with a black coachman and a splendid four horse carriage and an elegant dog which he was evidently fond of and proud of he drove up before gadsbys and the clerk and the landlord and everybody rushed out to take charge of him but he said never mind and jumped out and told the coachman to wait said he hadnt time to take anything to eat he only had a little claim against the government to collect would run across the way to the treasury and fetch the money and then get right along back to tennessee for he was in considerable of a hurry well about eleven o clock that night he came back and ordered a bed and told them to put the horses up said he would collect the claim in the morning this was in january you understand january thed of january wednesday well on the th of february he sold the fine carriage and bought a cheap second hand one said it would answer just as well to take the money home in and he didnt care for style on the th of august he sold a pair of the fine horses said hed often thought a pair was better than four to go over the rough mountain roads with where a body had to be careful about his driving and there wasnt so much of his claim but he could lug the money home with a pair easy enough on the th of december he sold another horse said two warnt necessary to drag that old light vehicle with in fact one could snatch it along faster than was absolutely necessary now that it was good solid winter weather and the roads in splendid condition on the th of february he sold the old carriage and bought a cheap second hand buggy said a buggy was just the trick to skim along mushy slushy early spring roads with and he had always wanted to try a buggy on those mountain roads anyway on the st august he sold the buggy and bought the remains of an old sulky said he just wanted to see those green tennesseans stare and gawk when they saw him come a ripping along in a sulky didnt believe theyd ever heard of a sulky in their lives well on the th of august he sold his colored coachman said he didnt need a coachman for a sulky wouldnt be room enough for two in it anyway and besides it wasnt every day that providence sent a man a fool who was willing to pay nine hundred dollars for such a third rate negro as that been wanting to get rid of the creature for years but didnt like to throw him away eighteen months later that is to say on the th of february he sold the sulky and bought a saddle said horseback riding was what the doctor had always recommended him to take and dogd if he wanted to risk his neck going over those mountain roads on wheels in the dead of winter not if he knew himself on the th of april he sold the saddle said he wasnt going to risk his life with any perishable saddle girth that ever was made over a rainy miry april road while he could ride bareback and know and feel he was safe always had despised to ride on a saddle anyway on the th of april he sold his horse said im just fifty seven today hale and hearty it would be a pretty howdy do for me to be wasting such a trip as that and such weather as this on a horse when there aint anything in the world so splendid as a tramp on foot through the fresh spring woods and over the cheery mountains to a man that is a man and i can make my dog carry my claim in a little bundle anyway when its collected so tomorrow i ll be up bright and early make my little old collection and mosey off to tennessee on my own hind legs with a rousing good by to gadsbys on thed of june he sold his dog said dern a dog anyway where you re just starting off on a rattling bully pleasure tramp through the summer woods and hills perfect nuisance chases the squirrels barks at everything goes a capering and splattering around in the fords man cant get any chance to reflect and enjoy nature and id a blamed sight ruther carry the claim myself its a mighty sight safer a dogs mighty uncertain in a financial way always noticed it well good by boys last call im off for tennessee with a good leg and a gay heart early in the morning there was a pause and a silence except the noise of the wind and the pelting snow mr lykins said impatiently well riley said well that was thirty years ago very well very well what of it im great friends with that old patriarch he comes every evening to tell me good by i saw him an hour ago hes off for tennessee early tomorrow morning as usual said he calculated to get his claim through and be off before night owls like me have turned out of bed the tears were in his eyes he was so glad he was going to see his old tennessee and his friends once more another silent pause the stranger broke it is that all that is all well for the time of night and the kind of night it seems to me the story was full long enough but whats it all for oh nothing in particular well wheres the point of it oh there isnt any particular point to it only if you are not in too much of a hurry to rush off to san francisco with that post office appointment mr lykins id advise you to put up at gadsbys for a spell and take it easy good by god bless you so saying riley blandly turned on his heel and left the astonished school teacher standing there a musing and motionless snow image shining in the broad glow of the street lamp he never got that post office to go back to lucerne and its fishers i concluded after about nine hours waiting that the man who proposes to tarry till he sees something hook one of those well fed and experienced fishes will find it wisdom to put up at gadsbys and take it easy it is likely that a fish has not been caught on that lake pier for forty years but no matter the patient fisher watches his cork there all the day long just the same and seems to enjoy it one may see the fisher loafers just as thick and contented and happy and patient all along the seine at paris but tradition says that the only thing ever caught there in modern times is a thing they dont fish for at all the recent dog and the translated cat chapter xxvii i spare an awful bore close by the lion of lucerne is what they call the glacier garden and it is the only one in the world it is on high ground four or five years ago some workmen who were digging foundations for a house came upon this interesting relic of a long departed age scientific men perceived in it a confirmation of their theories concerning the glacial period so through their persuasions the little tract of ground was bought and permanently protected against being built upon the soil was removed and there lay the rasped and guttered track which the ancient glacier had made as it moved along upon its slow and tedious journey this track was perforated by huge pot shaped holes in the bed rock formed by the furious washing around in them of boulders by the turbulent torrent which flows beneath all glaciers these huge round boulders still remain in the holes they and the walls of the holes are worn smooth by the long continued chafing which they gave each other in those old days it took a mighty force to churn these big lumps of stone around in that vigorous way the neighboring country had a very different shape at that time the valleys have risen up and become hills since and the hills have become valleys the boulders discovered in the pots had traveled a great distance for there is no rock like them nearer than the distant rhone glacier for some days we were content to enjoy looking at the blue lake lucerne and at the piled up masses of snow mountains that border it all around an enticing spectacle this last for there is a strange and fascinating beauty and charm about a majestic snow peak with the sun blazing upon it or the moonlight softly enriching it but finally we concluded to try a bit of excursioning around on a steamboat and a dash on foot at the rigi very well we had a delightful trip to fluelen on a breezy sunny day everybody sat on the upper deck on benches under an awning everybody talked laughed and exclaimed at the wonderful scenery in truth a trip on that lake is almost the perfection of pleasuring the mountains were a never ceasing marvel sometimes they rose straight up out of the lake and towered aloft and overshadowed our pygmy steamer with their prodigious bulk in the most impressive way not snow clad mountains these yet they climbed high enough toward the sky to meet the clouds and veil their foreheads in them they were not barren and repulsive but clothed in green and restful and pleasant to the eye and they were so almost straight up and down sometimes that one could not imagine a man being able to keep his footing upon such a surface yet there are paths and the swiss people go up and down them every day sometimes one of these monster precipices had the slight inclination of the huge ship houses in dockyards then high aloft toward the sky it took a little stronger inclination like that of a mansard roof and perched on this dizzy mansard ones eye detected little things like martin boxes and presently perceived that these were the dwellings of peasants an airy place for a home truly and suppose a peasant should walk in his sleep or his child should fall out of the front yard the friends would have a tedious long journey down out of those cloud heights before they found the remains and yet those far away homes looked ever so seductive they were so remote from the troubled world they dozed in such an atmosphere of peace and dreams surely no one who has learned to live up there would ever want to live on a meaner level we swept through the prettiest little curving arms of the lake among these colossal green walls enjoying new delights always as the stately panorama unfolded itself before us and rerolled and hid itself behind us and now and then we had the thrilling surprise of bursting suddenly upon a tremendous white mass like the distant and dominating jungfrau or some kindred giant looming head and shoulders above a tumbled waste of lesser alps once while i was hungrily taking in one of these surprises and doing my best to get all i possibly could of it while it should last i was interrupted by a young and care free voice you re an american i think som i he was about eighteen or possibly nineteen slender and of medium height open frank happy face a restless but independent eye a snub nose which had the air of drawing back with a decent reserve from the silky new born mustache below it until it should be introduced a loosely hung jaw calculated to work easily in the sockets he wore a low crowned narrow brimmed straw hat with a broad blue ribbon around it which had a white anchor embroidered on it in front nobby short tailed coat pantaloons vest all trim and neat and up with the fashion red striped stockings very low quarter patent leather shoes tied with black ribbon blue ribbon around his neck wide open collar tiny diamond studs wrinkleless kids projecting cuffs fastened with large oxidized silver sleeve buttons bearing the device of a dogs face english pug he carried a slim cane surmounted with an english pugs head with red glass eyes under his arm he carried a german grammar ottos his hair was short straight and smooth and presently when he turned his head a moment i saw that it was nicely parted behind he took a cigarette out of a dainty box stuck it into a meerschaum holder which he carried in a morocco case and reached for my cigar while he was lighting i said yes i am an american i knew it i can always tell them what ship did you come over in holsatia we came in the batavia cunard you know what kind of passage did you have tolerably rough so did we captain said hed hardly ever seen it rougher where are you from new england som i im from new bloomfield anybody with you yes a friend our whole familys along its awful slow going around alone dont you think so rather slow ever been over here before

acquaintances dont you lord yes you see it breaks up a trip like this first rate i never got bored on a trip like this if i can make acquaintances and have somebody to talk to but i think a trip like this would be an awful bore if a body couldnt find anybody to get acquainted with and talk to on a trip like this im fond of talking aint you passionately have you felt bored on this trip not all the time part of it thats it you see you ought to go around and get acquainted and talk thats my way thats the way i always do i just go round round round and talk talk talk i never get bored you been up the rigi yet no going i think so what hotel you going to stop at i dont know is there more than one three you stop at the schreiber you ll find it full of americans what ship did you say you came over

hold of the right kind of a person aint you i prefer it to any other dissipation thats my notion too now some people like to take a book and sit down and read and read and read or moon around yawping at the lake or these mountains and things but that aint my way no sir if they like it let em do it i dont object but as for me talkings what i like you been up the rigi yes what hotel did you stop at

what kind of a passage did excuse me a minute theres some americans i havent seen before and away he went he went uninjured too i had the murderous impulse to harpoon him in the back with my alpenstock but as i raised the weapon the disposition left me i found i hadnt the heart to kill him he was such a joyous innocent good natured numbskull half an hour later i was sitting on a bench inspecting with strong interest a noble monolith which we were skimming by a monolith not shaped by man but by natures free great hand a massy pyramidal rock eighty feet high devised by nature ten million years ago against the day when a man worthy of it should need it for his monument the time came at last and now this grand remembrancer bears schillers name in huge letters upon its face curiously enough this rock was not degraded or defiled in any way it is said that two years ago a stranger let himself down from the top of it with ropes and pulleys and painted all over it in blue letters bigger than those in schillers name these words try sozodont buy sun stove polish helmbolds buchu try benzaline for the blood he was captured and it turned out that he was an american upon his trial the judge said to him you are from a land where any insolent that wants to is privileged to profane and insult nature and through her natures god if by so doing he can put a sordid penny in his pocket but here the case is different because you are a foreigner and ignorant i will make your sentence light if you were a native i would deal strenuously with you hear and obey you will immediately remove every trace of your offensive work from the schiller monument you pay a fine of ten thousand francs you will suffer two years imprisonment at hard labor you will then be horsewhipped tarred and feathered deprived of your ears ridden on a rail to the confines of the canton and banished forever the severest penalties are omitted in your case not as a grace to you but to that great republic which had the misfortune to give you birth the steamers benches were ranged back to back across the deck my back hair was mingling innocently with the back hair of a couple of ladies presently they were addressed by some one and i overheard this conversation you are americans i think som i yes we are americans i knew it i can always tell them what ship did you come over in city of chester oh yes

guten tag chapter xxviii the jodel and its native wilds the rigi kulm is an imposing alpine mass six thousand feet high which stands by itself and commands a mighty prospect of blue lakes green valleys and snowy mountains a compact and magnificent picture three hundred miles in circumference the ascent is made by rail or horseback or on foot as one may prefer i and my agent panoplied ourselves in walking costume one bright morning and started down the lake on the steamboat we got ashore at the village of waeggis three quarters of an hour distant from lucerne this village is at the foot of the mountain we were soon tramping leisurely up the leafy mule path and then the talk began to flow as usual it was twelve o clock noon and a breezy cloudless day the ascent was gradual and the glimpses from under the curtaining boughs of blue water and tiny sailboats and beetling cliffs were as charming as glimpses of dreamland all the circumstances were perfect and the anticipations too for we should soon be enjoying for the first time that wonderful spectacle an alpine sunrise the object of our journey there was apparently no real need for hurry for the guide book made the walking distance from waeggis to the summit only three hours and a quarter i say apparently because the guide book had already fooled us once about the distance from allerheiligen to oppenau and for aught i knew it might be getting ready to fool us again we were only certain as to the altitudes we calculated to find out for ourselves how many hours it is from the bottom to the top the summit is six thousand feet above the sea but only forty five hundred feet above the lake when we had walked half an hour we were fairly into the swing and humor of the undertaking so we cleared for action that is to say we got a boy whom we met to carry our alpenstocks and satchels and overcoats and things for us that left us free for business i suppose we must have stopped oftener to stretch out on the grass in the shade and take a bit of a smoke than this boy was used to for presently he asked if it had been our idea to hire him by the job or by the year we told him he could move along if he was in a hurry he said he wasnt in such a very particular hurry but he wanted to get to the top while he was young we told him to clear out then and leave the things at the uppermost hotel and say we should be along presently he said he would secure us a hotel if he could but if they were all full he would ask them to build another one and hurry up and get the paint and plaster dry against we arrived still gently chaffing us he pushed ahead up the trail and soon disappeared by six o clock we were pretty high up in the air and the view of lake and mountains had greatly grown in breadth and interest we halted awhile at a little public house where we had bread and cheese and a quart or two of fresh milk out on the porch with the big panorama all before us and then moved on again ten minutes afterward we met a hot red faced man plunging down the mountain making mighty strides swinging his alpenstock ahead of him and taking a grip on the ground with its iron point to support these big strides he stopped fanned himself with his hat swabbed the perspiration from his face and neck with a red handkerchief panted a moment or two and asked how far to waeggis i said three hours he looked surprised and said why it seems as if i could toss a biscuit into the lake from here its so close by is that an inn there i said it was well said he i cant stand another three hours i ve had enough today i ll take a bed there i asked are we nearly to the top nearly to the top why bless your soul you havent really started yet i said we would put up at the inn too so we turned back and ordered a hot supper and had quite a jolly evening of it with this englishman the german landlady gave us neat rooms and nice beds and when i and my agent turned in it was with the resolution to be up early and make the utmost of our first alpine sunrise but of course we were dead tired and slept like policemen so when we awoke in the morning and ran to the window it was already too late because it was half past eleven it was a sharp disappointment however we ordered breakfast and told the landlady to call the englishman but she said he was already up and off at daybreak and swearing like mad about something or other we could not find out what the matter was he had asked the landlady the altitude of her place above the level of the lake and she told him fourteen hundred and ninety five feet that was all that was said then he lost his temper he said that between fools and guide books a man could acquire ignorance enough in twenty four hours in a country like this to last him a year harris believed our boy had been loading him up with misinformation and this was probably the case for his epithet described that boy to a dot we got under way about the turn of noon and pulled out for the summit again with a fresh and vigorous step when we had gone about two hundred yards and stopped to rest i glanced to the left while i was lighting my pipe and in the distance detected a long worm of black smoke crawling lazily up the steep mountain of course that was the locomotive we propped ourselves on our elbows at once to gaze for we had never seen a mountain railway yet presently we could make out the train it seemed incredible that that thing should creep straight up a sharp slant like the roof of a house but there it was and it was doing that very miracle in the course of a couple hours we reached a fine breezy altitude where the little shepherd huts had big stones all over their roofs to hold them down to the earth when the great storms rage the country was wild and rocky about here but there were plenty of trees plenty of moss and grass away off on the opposite shore of the lake we could see some villages and now for the first time we could observe the real difference between their proportions and those of the giant mountains at whose feet they slept when one is in one of those villages it seems spacious and its houses seem high and not out of proportion to the mountain that overhangs them but from our altitude what a change the mountains were bigger and grander than ever as they stood there thinking their solemn thoughts with their heads in the drifting clouds but the villages at their feet when the painstaking eye could trace them up and find them were so reduced almost invisible and lay so flat against the ground that the exactest simile i can devise is to compare them to ant deposits of granulated dirt overshadowed by the huge bulk of a cathedral the steamboats skimming along under the stupendous precipices were diminished by distance to the daintiest little toys the sailboats and rowboats to shallops proper for fairies that keep house in the cups of lilies and ride to court on the backs of bumblebees presently we came upon half a dozen sheep nibbling grass in the spray of a stream of clear water that sprang from a rock wall a hundred feet high and all at once our ears were startled with a melodious lul ll l l llul lul lahee o o o pealing joyously from a near but invisible source and recognized that we were hearing for the first time the famous alpine jodel in its own native wilds and we recognized also that it was that sort of quaint commingling of baritone and falsetto which at home we call tyrolese warbling the jodeling pronounced yodling emphasis on the o continued and was very pleasant and inspiriting to hear now the jodeler appeared a shepherd boy of sixteen and in our gladness and gratitude we gave him a franc to jodel some more so he jodeled and we listened we moved on presently and he generously jodeled us out of sight after about fifteen minutes we came across another shepherd boy who was jodeling and gave him half a franc to keep it up he also jodeled us out of sight after that we found a jodeler every ten minutes we gave the first one eight cents the second one six cents the third one four the fourth one a penny contributed nothing to nos and and during the remainder of the day hired the rest of the jodelers at a franc apiece not to jodel any more there is somewhat too much of the jodeling in the alps about the middle of the afternoon we passed through a prodigious natural gateway called the felsenthor formed by two enormous upright rocks with a third lying across the top there was a very attractive little hotel close by but our energies were not conquered yet so we went on three hours afterward we came to the railway track it was planted straight up the mountain with the slant of a ladder that leans against a house and it seemed to us that man would need good nerves who proposed to travel up it or down it either during the latter part of the afternoon we cooled our roasting interiors with ice cold water from clear streams the only really satisfying water we had tasted since we left home for at the hotels on the continent they merely give you a tumbler of ice to soak your water in and that only modifies its hotness doesnt make it cold water can only be made cold enough for summer comfort by being prepared in a refrigerator or a closed ice pitcher europeans say ice water impairs digestion how do they know they never drink any at ten minutes past six we reached the kaltbad station where there is a spacious hotel with great verandas which command a majestic expanse of lake and mountain scenery we were pretty well fagged out now but as we did not wish to miss the alpine sunrise we got through our dinner as quickly as possible and hurried off to bed it was unspeakably comfortable to stretch our weary limbs between the cool damp sheets and how we did sleep for there is no opiate like alpine pedestrianism in the morning we both awoke and leaped out of bed at the same instant and ran and stripped aside the window curtains but we suffered a bitter disappointment again it was already half past three in the afternoon we dressed sullenly and in ill spirits each accusing the other of oversleeping harris said if we had brought the courier along as we ought to have done we should not have missed these sunrises i said he knew very well that one of us would have to sit up and wake the courier and i added that we were having trouble enough to take care of ourselves on this climb without having to take care of a courier besides during breakfast our spirits came up a little since we found by this guide book that in the hotels on the summit the tourist is not left to trust to luck for his sunrise but is roused betimes by a man who goes through the halls with a great alpine horn blowing blasts that would raise the dead and there was another consoling thing the guide book said that up there on the summit the guests did not wait to dress much but seized a red bed blanket and sailed out arrayed like an indian this was good this would be romantic two hundred and fifty people grouped on the windy summit with their hair flying and their red blankets flapping in the solemn presence of the coming sun would be a striking and memorable spectacle so it was good luck not ill luck that we had missed those other sunrises we were informed by the guide book that we were now feet above the level of the lake therefore full two thirds of our journey had been accomplished we got away at a quarter past four p m a hundred yards above the hotel the railway divided one track went straight up the steep hill the other one turned square off to the right with a very slight grade we took the latter and followed it more than a mile turned a rocky corner and came in sight of a handsome new hotel if we had gone on we should have arrived at the summit but harris preferred to ask a lot of questions as usual of a man who didnt know anything and he told us to go back and follow the other route we did so we could ill afford this loss of time we climbed and climbed and we kept on climbing we reached about forty summits but there was always another one just ahead it came on to rain and it rained in dead earnest we were soaked through and it was bitter cold next a smoky fog of clouds covered the whole region densely and we took to the railway ties to keep from getting lost sometimes we slopped along in a narrow path on the left hand side of the track but by and by when the fog blew aside a little and we saw that we were treading the rampart of a precipice and that our left elbows were projecting over a perfectly boundless and bottomless vacancy we gasped and jumped for the ties again the night shut down dark and drizzly and cold about eight in the evening the fog lifted and showed us a well worn path which led up a very steep rise to the left we took it and as soon as we had got far enough from the railway to render the finding it again an impossibility the fog shut down on us once more we were in a bleak unsheltered place now and had to trudge right along in order to keep warm though we rather expected to go over a precipice sooner or later about nine o clock we made an important discovery that we were not in any path we groped around a while on our hands and knees but we could not find it so we sat down in the mud and the wet scant grass to wait we were terrified into this by being suddenly confronted with a vast body which showed itself vaguely for an instant and in the next instant was smothered in the fog again it was really the hotel we were after monstrously magnified by the fog but we took it for the face of a precipice and decided not to try to claw up it we sat there an hour with chattering teeth and quivering bodies and quarreled over all sorts of trifles but gave most of our attention to abusing each other for the stupidity of deserting the railway track we sat with our backs to the precipice because what little wind there was came from that quarter at some time or other the fog thinned a little we did not know when for we were facing the empty universe and the thinness could not show but at last harris happened to look around and there stood a huge dim spectral hotel where the precipice had been one could faintly discern the windows and chimneys and a dull blur of lights our first emotion was deep unutterable gratitude our next was a foolish rage born of the suspicion that possibly the hotel had been visible three quarters of an hour while we sat there in those cold puddles quarreling yes it was the rigi kulm hotel the one that occupies the extreme summit and whose remote little sparkle of lights we had often seen glinting high aloft among the stars from our balcony away down yonder in lucerne the crusty portier and the crusty clerks gave us the surly reception which their kind deal out in prosperous times but by mollifying them with an extra display of obsequiousness and servility we finally got them to show us to the room which our boy had engaged for us we got into some dry clothing and while our supper was preparing we loafed forsakenly through a couple of vast cavernous drawing rooms one of which had a stove in it this stove was in a corner and densely walled around with people we could not get near the fire so we moved at large in the artic spaces among a multitude of people who sat silent smileless forlorn and shivering thinking what fools they were to come perhaps there were some americans and some germans but one could see that the great majority were english we lounged into an apartment where there was a great crowd to see what was going on it was a memento magazine the tourists were eagerly buying all sorts and styles of paper cutters marked souvenir of the rigi with handles made of the little curved horn of the ostensible chamois there were all manner of wooden goblets and such things similarly marked i was going to buy a paper cutter but i believed i could remember the cold comfort of the rigi kulm without it so i smothered the impulse supper warmed us and we went immediately to bed but first as mr baedeker requests all tourists to call his attention to any errors which they may find in his guide books i dropped him a line to inform him he missed it by just about three days i had previously informed him of his mistake about the distance from allerheiligen to oppenau and had also informed the ordnance depart of the german government of the same error in the imperial maps i will add here that i never got any answer to those letters or any thanks from either of those sources and what is still more discourteous these corrections have not been made either in the maps or the guide books but i will write again when i get time for my letters may have miscarried we curled up in the clammy beds and went to sleep without rocking we were so sodden with fatigue that we never stirred nor turned over till the blooming blasts of the alpine horn aroused us it may well be imagined that we did not lose any time we snatched on a few odds and ends of clothing cocooned ourselves in the proper red blankets and plunged along the halls and out into the whistling wind bareheaded we saw a tall wooden scaffolding on the very peak of the summit a hundred yards away and made for it we rushed up the stairs to the top of this scaffolding and stood there above the vast outlying world with hair flying and ruddy blankets waving and cracking in the fierce breeze fifteen minutes too late at last said harris in a vexed voice the sun is clear above the horizon no matter i said it is a most magnificent spectacle and we will see it do the rest of its rising anyway in a moment we were deeply absorbed in the marvel before us and dead to everything else the great cloud barred disk of the sun stood just above a limitless expanse of tossing white caps so to speak a billowy chaos of massy mountain domes and peaks draped in imperishable snow and flooded with an opaline glory of changing and dissolving splendors while through rifts in a black cloud bank above the sun radiating lances of diamond dust shot to the zenith the cloven valleys of the lower world swam in a tinted mist which veiled the ruggedness of their crags and ribs and ragged forests and turned all the forbidding region into a soft and rich and sensuous paradise we could not speak we could hardly breathe we could only gaze in drunken ecstasy and drink in it presently harris exclaimed why nation its going down perfectly true we had missed the morning hornblow and slept all day this was stupefying harris said look here the sun isnt the spectacle its us stacked up here on top of this gallows in these idiotic blankets and two hundred and fifty well dressed men and women down here gawking up at us and not caring a straw whether the sun rises or sets as long as they ve got such a ridiculous spectacle as this to set down in their memorandum books they seem to be laughing their ribs loose and theres one girl there that appears to be going all to pieces i never saw such a man as you before i think you are the very last possibility in the way of an ass what have i done i answered with heat what have you done you ve got up at half past seven o clock in the evening to see the sun rise thats what you ve done and have you done any better id like to know i ve always used to get up with the lark till i came under the petrifying influence of your turgid intellect you used to get up with the lark oh no doubt you ll get up with the hangman one of these days but you ought to be ashamed to be jawing here like this in a red blanket on a forty foot scaffold on top of the alps and no end of people down here to boot this isnt any place for an exhibition of temper and so the customary quarrel went on when the sun was fairly down we slipped back to the hotel in the charitable gloaming and went to bed again we had encountered the horn blower on the way and he had tried to collect compensation not only for announcing the sunset which we did see but for the sunrise which we had totally missed but we said no we only took our solar rations on the european plan pay for what you get he promised to make us hear his horn

for sunrise he kept his word we heard his horn and instantly got up it was dark and cold and wretched as i fumbled around for the matches knocking things down with my quaking hands i wished the sun would rise in the middle of the day when it was warm and bright and cheerful and one wasnt sleepy we proceeded to dress by the gloom of a couple sickly candles but we could hardly button anything our hands shook so i thought of how many happy people there were in europe asia and america and everywhere who were sleeping peacefully in their beds and did not have to get up and see the rigi sunrise people who did not appreciate their advantage as like as not but would get up in the morning wanting more boons of providence while thinking these thoughts i yawned in a rather ample way and my upper teeth got hitched on a nail over the door and while i was mounting a chair to free myself harris drew the window curtain and said oh this is luck we shant have to go out at all yonder are the mountains in full view that was glad news indeed it made us cheerful right away one could see the grand alpine masses dimly outlined against the black firmament and one or two faint stars blinking through rifts in the night fully clothed and wrapped in blankets and huddled ourselves up by the window with lighted pipes and fell into chat while we waited in exceeding comfort to see how an alpine sunrise was going to look by candlelight by and by a delicate spiritual sort of effulgence spread itself by imperceptible degrees over the loftiest altitudes of the snowy wastes but there the effort seemed to stop i said presently there is a hitch about this sunrise somewhere it doesnt seem to go what do you reckon is the matter with it i dont know it appears to hang fire somewhere i never saw a sunrise act like that before can it be that the hotel is playing anything on us of course not the hotel merely has a property interest in the sun it has nothing to do with the management of it it is a precarious kind of property too a succession of total eclipses would probably ruin this tavern now what can be the matter with this sunrise harris jumped up and said i ve got it i know whats the matter with it we ve been looking at the place where the sun set last night it is perfectly true why couldnt you have thought of that sooner now we ve lost another one and all through your blundering it was exactly like you to light a pipe and sit down to wait for the sun to rise in the west it was exactly like me to find out the mistake too you never would have found it out i find out all the mistakes you make them all too else your most valuable faculty would be wasted on you but dont stop to quarrel now maybe we are not too late yet but we were the sun was well up when we got to the exhibition ground on our way up we met the crowd returning men and women dressed in all sorts of queer costumes and exhibiting all degrees of cold and wretchedness in their gaits and countenances a dozen still remained on the ground when we reached there huddled together about the scaffold with their backs to the bitter wind they had their red guide books open at the diagram of the view and were painfully picking out the several mountains and trying to impress their names and positions on their memories it was one of the saddest sights i ever saw two sides of this place were guarded by railings to keep people from being blown over the precipices the view looking sheer down into the broad valley eastward from this great elevation almost a perpendicular mile was very quaint and curious counties towns hilly ribs and ridges wide stretches of green meadow great forest tracts winding streams a dozen blue lakes a block of busy steamboats we saw all this little world in unique circumstantiality of detail saw it just as the birds see it and all reduced to the smallest of scales and as sharply worked out and finished as a steel engraving the numerous toy villages with tiny spires projecting out of them were just as the children might have left them when done with play the day before the forest tracts were diminished to cushions of moss one or two big lakes were dwarfed to ponds the smaller ones to puddles though they did not look like puddles but like blue teardrops which had fallen and lodged in slight depressions conformable to their shapes among the moss beds and the smooth levels of dainty green farm land the microscopic steamboats glided along as in a city reservoir taking a mighty time to cover the distance between ports which seemed only a yard apart and the isthmus which separated two lakes looked as if one might stretch out on it and lie with both elbows in the water yet we knew invisible wagons were toiling across it and finding the distance a tedious one this beautiful miniature world had exactly the appearance of those relief maps which reproduce nature precisely with the heights and depressions and other details graduated to a reduced scale and with the rocks trees lakes etc colored after nature i believed we could walk down to waeggis or vitznau in a day but i knew we could go down by rail in about an hour so i chose the latter method i wanted to see what it was like anyway the train came along about the middle of the afternoon and an odd thing it was the locomotive boiler stood on end and it and the whole locomotive were tilted sharply backward there were two passenger cars roofed but wide open all around these cars were not tilted back but the seats were this enables the passenger to sit level while going down a steep incline there are three railway tracks the central one is cogged the lantern wheel of the engine grips its way along these cogs and pulls the train up the hill or retards its motion on the down trip about the same speed three miles an hour is maintained both ways whether going up or down the locomotive is always at the lower end of the train it pushes in the one case braces back in the other the passenger rides backward going up and faces forward going down we got front seats and while the train moved along about fifty yards on level ground i was not the least frightened but now it started abruptly downstairs and i caught my breath and i like my neighbors unconsciously held back all i could and threw my weight to the rear but of course that did no particular good i had slidden down the balusters when i was a boy and thought nothing of it but to slide down the balusters in a railway train is a thing to make ones flesh creep sometimes we had as much as ten yards of almost level ground and this gave us a few full breaths in comfort but straightway we would turn a corner and see a long steep line of rails stretching down below us and the comfort was at an end one expected to see the locomotive pause or slack up a little and approach this plunge cautiously but it did nothing of the kind it went calmly on and went it reached the jumping off place it made a sudden bow and went gliding smoothly downstairs untroubled by the circumstances it was wildly exhilarating to slide along the edge of the precipices after this grisly fashion and look straight down upon that far off valley which i was describing a while ago there was no level ground at the kaltbad station the railbed was as steep as a roof i was curious to see how the stop was going to be managed but it was very simple the train came sliding down and when it reached the right spot it just stopped that was all there was to it stopped on the steep incline and when the exchange of passengers and baggage had been made it moved off and went sliding down again the train can be stopped anywhere at a moments notice there was one curious effect which i need not take the trouble to describe because i can scissor a description of it out of the railway companys advertising pamphlet and save my ink on the whole tour particularly at the descent we undergo an optical illusion which often seems to be incredible all the shrubs fir trees stables houses etc seem to be bent in a slanting direction as by an immense pressure of air they are all standing awry so much awry that the chalets and cottages of the peasants seem to be tumbling down it is the consequence of the steep inclination of the line those who are seated in the carriage do not observe that they are going down a declivity of twenty to twenty five degrees their seats being adapted to this course of proceeding and being bent down at their backs they mistake their carriage and its horizontal lines for a proper measure of the normal plain and therefore all the objects outside which really are in a horizontal position must show a disproportion of twenty to twenty five degrees declivity in regard to the mountain by the time one reaches kaltbad he has acquired confidence in the railway and he now ceases to try to ease the locomotive by holding back thenceforth he smokes his pipe in serenity and gazes out upon the magnificent picture below and about him with unfettered enjoyment there is nothing to interrupt the view or the breeze it is like inspecting the world on the wing however to be exact there is one place where the serenity lapses for a while this is while one is crossing the schnurrtobel bridge a frail structure which swings its gossamer frame down through the dizzy air over a gorge like a vagrant spider strand one has no difficulty in remembering his sins while the train is creeping down this bridge and he repents of them too though he sees when he gets to vitznau that he need not have done it the bridge was perfectly safe so ends the eventual trip which we made to the rigi kulm to see an alpine sunrise chapter xxx harris climbs mountains for me an hours sail brought us to lucerne again i judged it best to go to bed and rest several days for i knew that the man who undertakes to make the tour of europe on foot must take care of himself thinking over my plans as mapped out i perceived that they did not take in the furka pass the rhone glacier the finsteraarhorn the wetterhorn etc i immediately examined the guide book to see if these were important and found they were in fact a pedestrian tour of europe could not be complete without them of course that decided me at once to see them for i never allow myself to do things by halves or in a slurring slipshod way i called in my agent and instructed him to go without delay and make a careful examination of these noted places on foot and bring me back a written report of the result for insertion in my book i instructed him to go to hospenthal as quickly as possible and make his grand start from there to extend his foot expedition as far as the giesbach fall and return to me from thence by diligence or mule i told him to take the courier with him he objected to the courier and with some show of reason since he was about to venture upon new and untried ground but i thought he might as well learn how to take care of the courier now as later therefore i enforced my point i said that the trouble delay and inconvenience of traveling with a courier were balanced by the deep respect which a couriers presence commands and i must insist that as much style be thrown into my journeys as possible so the two assumed complete mountaineering costumes and departed a week later they returned pretty well used up and my agent handed me the following official report of a visit to the furka region by h harris agent about seven o clock in the morning with perfectly fine weather we started from hospenthal and arrived at the maison on the furka in a little under quatre hours the want of variety in the scenery from hospenthal made the kahkahponeeka wearisome but let none be discouraged no one can fail to be completely r ecompens ee for his fatigue when he sees for the first time the monarch of the oberland the tremendous finsteraarhorn a moment before all was dullness but a pas further has placed us on the summit of the furka and exactly in front of us at a hopow of only fifteen miles this magnificent mountain lifts its snow wreathed precipices into the deep blue sky the inferior mountains on each side of the pass form a sort of frame for the picture of their dread lord and close in the view so completely that no other prominent feature in the oberland is visible from this bong a bong nothing withdraws the attention from the solitary grandeur of the finsteraarhorn and the dependent spurs which form the abutments of the central peak with the addition of some others who were also bound for the grimsel we formed a large xhvloj as we descended the steg which winds round the shoulder of a mountain toward the rhone glacier we soon left the path and took to the ice and after wandering amongst the crevices un peu to admire the wonders of these deep blue caverns and hear the rushing of waters through their subglacial channels we struck out a course toward l autre c te and crossed the glacier successfully a little above the cave from which the infant rhone takes its first bound from under the grand precipice of ice half a mile below this we began to climb the flowery side of the meienwand one of our party started before the rest but the hitze was so great that we found ihm quite exhausted and lying at full length in the shade of a large gestein we sat down with him for a time for all felt the heat exceedingly in the climb up this very steep bolwoggoly and then we set out again together and arrived at last near the dead mans lake at the foot of the sidelhorn this lonely spot once used for an extempore burying place after a sanguinary battue between the french and austrians is the perfection of desolation there is nothing in sight to mark the hand of man except the line of weather beaten whitened posts set up to indicate the direction of the pass in the owdawakk of winter near this point the footpath joins the wider track which connects the grimsel with the head of the rhone schnawp this has been carefully constructed and leads with a tortuous course among and over les pierres down to the bank of the gloomy little swosh swosh which almost washes against the walls of the grimsel hospice we arrived a little before four o clock at the end of our days journey hot enough to justify the step taking by most of the partie of plunging into the crystal water of the snow fed lake the next afternoon we started for a walk up the unteraar glacier with the intention of at all events getting as far as the h tte which is used as a sleeping place by most of those who cross the strahleck pass to grindelwald we got over the tedious collection of stones and d bris which covers the pied of the gletcher and had walked nearly three hours from the grimsel when just as we were thinking of crossing over to the right to climb the cliffs at the foot of the hut the clouds which had for some time assumed a threatening appearance suddenly dropped and a huge mass of them driving toward us from the finsteraarhorn poured down a deluge of haboolong and hail fortunately we were not far from a very large glacier table it was a huge rock balanced on a pedestal of ice high enough to admit of our all creeping under it for gowkarak a stream of puckittypukk had furrowed a course for itself in the ice at its base and we were obliged to stand with one fuss on each side of this and endeavor to keep ourselves chaud by cutting steps in the steep bank of the pedestal so as to get a higher place for standing on as the wasser rose rapidly in its trench a very cold bzzzzzzzzeee accompanied the storm and made our position far from pleasant and presently came a flash of blitzen apparently in the middle of our little party with an instantaneous clap of yokky sounding like a large gun fired close to our ears the effect was startling but in a few seconds our attention was fixed by the roaring echoes of the thunder against the tremendous mountains which completely surrounded us this was followed by many more bursts none of welche however was so dangerously near and after waiting a long demi hour in our icy prison we sallied out to talk through a haboolong which though not so heavy as before was quite enough to give us a thorough soaking before our arrival at the hospice the grimsel is certainement a wonderful place situated at the bottom of a sort of huge crater the sides of which are utterly savage gebirge composed of barren rocks which cannot even support a single pine arbre and afford only scanty food for a herd of gmwkwllolp it looks as if it must be completely begraben in the winter snows enormous avalanches fall against it every spring sometimes covering everything to the depth of thirty or forty feet and in spite of walls four feet thick and furnished with outside shutters the two men who stay here when the voyageurs are snugly quartered in their distant homes can tell you that the snow sometimes shakes the house to its foundations next morning the hogglebumgullup still continued bad but we made up our minds to go on and make the best of it half an hour after we started the regen thickened unpleasantly and we attempted to get shelter under a projecting rock but being far to nass already to make standing at all agr able we pushed on for the handeck consoling ourselves with the reflection that from the furious rushing of the river aar at our side we should at all events see the celebrated wasserfall in grande perfection nor were we nappersocket in our expectation the water was roaring down its leap of two hundred and fifty feet in a most magnificent frenzy while the trees which cling to its rocky sides swayed to and fro in the violence of the hurricane which it brought down with it even the stream which falls into the main cascade at right angles and toutefois forms a beautiful feature in the scene was now swollen into a raging torrent and the violence of this meeting of the waters about fifty feet below the frail bridge where we stood was fearfully grand while we were looking at it gl ecklicheweise a gleam of sunshine came out and instantly a beautiful rainbow was formed by the spray and hung in mid air suspended over the awful gorge on going into the chalet above the fall we were informed that a bruecke had broken down near guttanen and that it would be impossible to proceed for some time accordingly we were kept in our drenched condition for ein stunde when some voyageurs arrived from meiringen and told us that there had been a trifling accident aber that we could now cross on arriving at the spot i was much inclined to suspect that the whole story was a ruse to make us slowwk and drink the more at the handeck inn for only a few planks had been carried away and though there might perhaps have been some difficulty with mules the gap was certainly not larger than a mmbglx might cross with a very slight leap near guttanen the haboolong happily ceased and we had time to walk ourselves tolerably dry before arriving at reichenback wo we enjoyed a good din at the hotel des alps next morning we walked to rosenlaui the beau id al of swiss scenery where we spent the middle of the day in an excursion to the glacier this was more beautiful than words can describe for in the constant progress of the ice it has changed the form of its extremity and formed a vast cavern as blue as the sky above and rippled like a frozen ocean a few steps cut in the whoopjamboreehoo enabled us to walk completely under this and feast our eyes upon one of the loveliest objects in creation the glacier was all around divided by numberless fissures of the same exquisite color and the finest wood erdbeeren were growing in abundance but a few yards from the ice the inn stands in a charmant spot close to the ct de la rivi re which lower down forms the reichenbach fall and embosomed in the richest of pine woods while the fine form of the wellhorn looking down upon it completes the enchanting bopple in the afternoon we walked over the great scheideck to grindelwald stopping to pay a visit to the upper glacier by the way but we were again overtaken by bad hogglebumgullup and arrived at the hotel in a solche a state that the landlords wardrobe was in great request the clouds by this time seemed to have done their worst for a lovely day succeeded which we determined to devote to an ascent of the faulhorn we left grindelwald just as a thunder storm was dying away and we hoped to find guten wetter up above but the rain which had nearly ceased began again and we were struck by the rapidly increasing froid as we ascended two thirds of the way up were completed when the rain was exchanged for gnillic with which the boden was thickly covered and before we arrived at the top the gnillic and mist became so thick that we could not see one another at more than twenty poopoo distance and it became difficult to pick our way over the rough and thickly covered ground shivering with cold we turned into bed with a double allowance of clothes and slept comfortably while the wind howled autour de la maison when i awoke the wall and the window looked equally dark but in another hour i found i could just see the form of the latter so i jumped out of bed and forced it open though with great difficulty from the frost and the quantities of gnillic heaped up against it a row of huge icicles hung down from the edge of the roof and anything more wintry than the whole anblick could not well be imagined but the sudden appearance of the great mountains in front was so startling that i felt no inclination to move toward bed again the snow which had collected upon la f ntre had increased the finsterniss oder der dunkelheit so that when i looked out i was surprised to find that the daylight was considerable and that the balragoomah would evidently rise before long only the brightest of les e toiles were still shining the sky was cloudless overhead though small curling mists lay thousands of feet below us in the valleys wreathed around the feet of the mountains and adding to the splendor of their lofty summits we were soon dressed and out of the house watching the gradual approach of dawn thoroughly absorbed in the first near view of the oberland giants which broke upon us unexpectedly after the intense obscurity of the evening before kabaugwakko songwashee kum wetterhorn snawpo cried some one as that grand summit gleamed with the first rose of dawn and in a few moments the double crest of the schreckhorn followed its example peak after peak seemed warmed with life the jungfrau blushed even more beautifully than her neighbors and soon from the wetterhorn in the east to the wildstrubel in the west a long row of fires glowed upon mighty altars truly worthy of the gods the wlgw was very severe our sleeping place could hardly be distingue from the snow around it which had fallen to a depth of a flirk during the past evening and we heartily enjoyed a rough scramble en bas to the giesbach falls where we soon found a warm climate at noon the day before grindelwald the thermometer could not have stood at less than degrees fahr in the sun and in the evening judging from the icicles formed and the state of the windows there must have been at least twelve dingblatter of frost thus giving a change of degrees during a few hours i said you have done well harris this report is concise compact well expressed the language is crisp the descriptions are vivid and not needlessly elaborated your report goes straight to the point attends strictly to business and doesnt fool around it is in many ways an excellent document but it has a fault it is too learned it is much too learned what is dingblatter dingblatter is a fiji word meaning degrees you knew the english of it then oh yes what is gnillic that is the eskimo term for snow so you knew the english for that too why certainly what does mmbglx stand for that is zulu for pedestrian while the form of the wellhorn looking down upon it completes the enchanting bopple what is bopple picture its choctaw what is schnawp valley that is choctaw also what is bolwoggoly that is chinese for hill kahkahponeeka ascent choctaw but we were again overtaken by bad hogglebumgullup what does hogglebumgullup mean that is chinese for weather is hogglebumgullup better than the english word is it any more descriptive no it means just the same and dingblatter and gnillic and bopple and schnawp are they better than the english words no they mean just what the english ones do then why do you use them why have you used all this chinese and choctaw and zulu rubbish because i didnt know any french but two or three words and i didnt know any latin or greek at all that is nothing why should you want to use foreign words anyhow they adorn my page they all do it who is all everybody everybody that writes elegantly anybody has a right to that wants to i think you are mistaken i then proceeded in the following scathing manner when really learned men write books for other learned men to read they are justified in using as many learned words as they please their audience will understand them but a man who writes a book for the general public to read is not justified in disfiguring his pages with untranslated foreign expressions it is an insolence toward the majority of the purchasers for it is a very frank and impudent way of saying get the translations made yourself if you want them this book is not written for the ignorant classes there are men who know a foreign language so well and have used it so long in their daily life that they seem to discharge whole volleys of it into their english writings unconsciously and so they omit to translate as much as half the time that is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the mans readers what is the excuse for this the writer would say he only uses the foreign language where the delicacy of his point cannot be conveyed in english very well then he writes his best things for the tenth man and he ought to warn the nine other not to buy his book however the excuse he offers is at least an excuse but there is another set of men who are like you they know a word here and there of a foreign language or a few beggarly little three word phrases filched from the back of the dictionary and these are continually peppering into their literature with a pretense of knowing that language what excuse can they offer the foreign words and phrases which they use have their exact equivalents in a nobler language english yet they think they adorn their page when they say strasse for street and bahnhof for railway station and so on flaunting these fluttering rags of poverty in the readers face and imagining he will be ass enough to take them for the sign of untold riches held in reserve i will let your learning remain in your report you have as much right i suppose to adorn your page with zulu and chinese and choctaw rubbish as others of your sort have to adorn theirs with insolent odds and ends smouched from half a dozen learned tongues whose a b abs they dont even know when the musing spider steps upon the red hot shovel he first exhibits a wild surprise then he shrivels up similar was the effect of these blistering words upon the tranquil and unsuspecting agent i can be dreadfully rough on a person when the mood takes me chapter xxxi alp scaling by carriage we now prepared for a considerable walk from lucerne to interlaken over the bruenig pass but at the last moment the weather was so good that i changed my mind and hired a four horse carriage it was a huge vehicle roomy as easy in its motion as a palanquin and exceedingly comfortable we got away pretty early in the morning after a hot breakfast and went bowling over a hard smooth road through the summer loveliness of switzerland with near and distant lakes and mountains before and about us for the entertainment of the eye and the music of multitudinous birds to charm the ear sometimes there was only the width of the road between the imposing precipices on the right and the clear cool water on the left with its shoals of uncatchable fish skimming about through the bars of sun and shadow and sometimes in place of the precipices the grassy land stretched away in an apparently endless upward slant and was dotted everywhere with snug little chalets the peculiarly captivating cottage of switzerland the ordinary chalet turns a broad honest gable end to the road and its ample roof hovers over the home in a protecting caressing way projecting its sheltering eaves far outward the quaint windows are filled with little panes and garnished with white muslin curtains and brightened with boxes of blooming flowers across the front of the house and up the spreading eaves and along the fanciful railings of the shallow porch are elaborate carvings wreaths fruits arabesques verses from scripture names dates etc the building is wholly of wood reddish brown in tint a very pleasing color it generally has vines climbing over it set such a house against the fresh green of the hillside and it looks ever so cozy and inviting and picturesque and is a decidedly graceful addition to the landscape one does not find out what a hold the chalet has taken upon him until he presently comes upon a new house a house which is aping the town fashions of germany and france a prim hideous straight up and down thing plastered all over on the outside to look like stone and altogether so stiff and formal and ugly and forbidding and so out of tune with the gracious landscape and so deaf and dumb and dead to the poetry of its surroundings that it suggests an undertaker at a picnic a corpse at a wedding a puritan in paradise in the course of the morning we passed the spot where pontius pilate is said to have thrown himself into the lake the legend goes that after the crucifixion his conscience troubled him and he fled from jerusalem and wandered about the earth weary of life and a prey to tortures of the mind eventually he hid himself away on the heights of mount pilatus and dwelt alone among the clouds and crags for years but rest and peace were still denied him so he finally put an end to his misery by drowning himself presently we passed the place where a man of better odor was born this was the childrens friend santa claus or st nicholas there are some unaccountable reputations in the world this saints is an instance he has ranked for ages as the peculiar friend of children yet it appears he was not much of a friend to his own he had ten of them and when fifty years old he left them and sought out as dismal a refuge from the world as possible and became a hermit in order that he might reflect upon pious themes without being disturbed by the joyous and other noises from the nursery doubtless judging by pilate and st nicholas there exists no rule for the construction of hermits they seem made out of all kinds of material but pilate attended to the matter of expiating his sin while he was alive whereas st nicholas will probably have to go on climbing down sooty chimneys christmas eve forever and conferring kindness on other peoples children to make up for deserting his own his bones are kept in a church in a village sachseln which we visited and are naturally held in great reverence his portrait is common in the farmhouses of the region but is believed by many to be but an indifferent likeness during his hermit life according to legend he partook of the bread and wine of the communion once a month but all the rest of the month he fasted a constant marvel with us as we sped along the bases of the steep mountains on this journey was not that avalanches occur but that they are not occurring all the time one does not understand why rocks and landslides do not plunge down these declivities daily a landslip occurred three quarters of a century ago on the route from arth to brunnen which was a formidable thing a mass of conglomerate two miles long a thousand feet broad and a hundred feet thick broke away from a cliff three thousand feet high and hurled itself into the valley below burying four villages and five hundred people as in a grave we had such a beautiful day and such endless pictures of limpid lakes and green hills and valleys and majestic mountains and milky cataracts dancing down the steeps and gleaming in the sun that we could not help feeling sweet toward all the world so we tried to drink all the milk and eat all the grapes and apricots and berries and buy all the bouquets of wild flowers which the little peasant boys and girls offered for sale but we had to retire from this contract for it was too heavy at short distances and they were entirely too short all along the road were groups of neat and comely children with their wares nicely and temptingly set forth in the grass under the shade trees and as soon as we approached they swarmed into the road holding out their baskets and milk bottles and ran beside the carriage barefoot and bareheaded and importuned us to buy they seldom desisted early but continued to run and insist beside the wagon while they could and behind it until they lost breath then they turned and chased a returning carriage back to their trading post again after several hours of this without any intermission it becomes almost annoying i do not know what we should have done without the returning carriages to draw off the pursuit however there were plenty of these loaded with dusty tourists and piled high with luggage indeed from lucerne to interlaken we had the spectacle among other scenery of an unbroken procession of fruit peddlers and tourists carriages our talk was mostly anticipatory of what we should see on the down grade of the bruenig by and by after we should pass the summit all our friends in lucerne had said that to look down upon meiringen and the rushing blue gray river aar and the broad level green valley and across at the mighty alpine precipices that rise straight up to the clouds out of that valley and up at the microscopic chalets perched upon the dizzy eaves of those precipices and winking dimly and fitfully through the drifting veil of vapor and still up and up at the superb oltschiback and the other beautiful cascades that leap from those rugged heights robed in powdery spray ruffled with foam and girdled with rainbows to look upon these things they say was to look upon the last possibility of the sublime and the enchanting therefore as i say we talked mainly of these coming wonders if we were conscious of any impatience it was to get there in favorable season if we felt any anxiety it was that the day might remain perfect and enable us to see those marvels at their best as we approached the kaiserstuhl a part of the harness gave way we were in distress for a moment but only a moment it was the fore and aft gear that was broken the thing that leads aft from the forward part of the horse and is made fast to the thing that pulls the wagon in america this would have been a heavy leathern strap but all over the continent it is nothing but a piece of rope the size of your little finger clothes line is what it is cabs use it private carriages freight carts and wagons all sorts of vehicles have it in munich i afterward saw it used on a long wagon laden with fifty four half barrels of beer i had before noticed that the cabs in heidelberg used it not new rope but rope that had been in use since abrahams time and i had felt nervous sometimes behind it when the cab was tearing down a hill but i had long been accustomed to it now and had even become afraid of the leather strap which belonged in its place our driver got a fresh piece of clothes line out of his locker and repaired the break in two minutes so much for one european fashion every country has its own ways it may interest the reader to know how they put horses to on the continent the man stands up the horses on each side of the thing that projects from the front end of the wagon and then throws the tangled mess of gear forward through a ring and hauls it aft and passes the other thing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the other horse opposite to the first one after crossing them and bringing the loose end back and then buckles the other thing underneath the horse and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing i spoke of before and puts another thing over each horses head with broad flappers to it to keep the dust out of his eyes and puts the iron thing in his mouth for him to grit his teeth on uphill and brings the ends of these things aft over his back after buckling another one around under his neck to hold his head up and hitching another thing on a thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is climbing a hill and then takes the slack of the thing which i mentioned a while ago and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that pulls the wagon and hands the other things up to the driver to steer with i never have buckled up a horse myself but i do not think we do it that way we had four very handsome horses and the driver was very proud of his turnout he would bowl along on a reasonable trot on the highway but when he entered a village he did it on a furious run and accompanied it with a frenzy of ceaseless whip crackings that sounded like volleys of musketry he tore through the narrow streets and around the sharp curves like a moving earthquake showering his volleys as he went and before him swept a continuous tidal wave of scampering children ducks cats and mothers clasping babies which they had snatched out of the way of the coming destruction and as this living wave washed aside along the walls its elements being safe forgot their fears and turned their admiring gaze upon that gallant driver till he thundered around the next curve and was lost to sight he was a great man to those villagers with his gaudy clothes and his terrific ways whenever he stopped to have his cattle watered and fed with loaves of bread the villagers stood around admiring him while he swaggered about the little boys gazed up at his face with humble homage and the landlord brought out foaming mugs of beer and conversed proudly with him while he drank then he mounted his lofty box swung his explosive whip and away he went again like a storm i had not seen anything like this before since i was a boy and the stage used to flourish the village with the dust flying and the horn tooting when we reached the base of the kaiserstuhl we took two more horses we had to toil along with difficulty for an hour and a half or two hours for the ascent was not very gradual but when we passed the backbone and approached the station the driver surpassed all his previous efforts in the way of rush and clatter he could not have six horses all the time so he made the most of his chance while he had it up to this point we had been in the heart of the william tell region the hero is not forgotten by any means or held in doubtful veneration his wooden image with his bow drawn above the doors of taverns was a frequent feature of the scenery about noon we arrived at the foot of the bruenig pass and made a two hour stop at the village hotel another of those clean pretty and thoroughly well kept inns which are such an astonishment to people who are accustomed to hotels of a dismally different pattern in remote country towns there was a lake here in the lap of the great mountains the green slopes that rose toward the lower crags were graced with scattered swiss cottages nestling among miniature farms and gardens and from out a leafy ambuscade in the upper heights tumbled a brawling cataract carriage after carriage laden with tourists and trunks arrived and the quiet hotel was soon populous we were early at the table dh te and saw the people all come in there were twenty five perhaps they were of various nationalities but we were the only americans next to me sat an english bride and next to her sat her new husband whom she called neddy though he was big enough and stalwart enough to be entitled to his full name they had a pretty little lovers quarrel over what wine they should have neddy was for obeying the guide book and taking the wine of the country but the bride said what that nahsty stuff it isnt nahsty pet its quite good it is nahsty no it isnt nahsty its oful nahsty neddy and i shahnt drink it then the question was what she must have she said he knew very well that she never drank anything but champagne she added you know very well papa always has champagne on his table and i ve always been used to it neddy made a playful pretense of being distressed about the expense and this amused her so much that she nearly exhausted herself with laughter and this pleased him so much that he repeated his jest a couple of times and added new and killing varieties to it when the bride finally recovered she gave neddy a love box on the arm with her fan and said with arch severity well you would have me nothing else would do so you ll have to make the best of a bad bargain do order the champagne im oful dry so with a mock groan which made her laugh again neddy ordered the champagne the fact that this young woman had never moistened the selvedge edge of her soul with a less plebeian tipple than champagne had a marked and subduing effect on harris he believed she belonged to the royal family but i had my doubts we heard two or three different languages spoken by people at the table and guessed out the nationalities of most of the guests to our satisfaction but we failed with an elderly gentleman and his wife and a young girl who sat opposite us and with a gentleman of about thirty five who sat three seats beyond harris we did not hear any of these speak but finally the last named gentleman left while we were not noticing but we looked up as he reached the far end of the table he stopped there a moment and made his toilet with a pocket comb so he was a german or else he had lived in german hotels long enough to catch the fashion when the elderly couple and the young girl rose to leave they bowed respectfully to us so they were germans too this national custom is worth six of the other one for export after dinner we talked with several englishmen and they inflamed our desire to a hotter degree than ever to see the sights of meiringen from the heights of the bruenig pass they said the view was marvelous and that one who had seen it once could never forget it they also spoke of the romantic nature of the road over the pass and how in one place it had been cut through a flank of the solid rock in such a way that the mountain overhung the tourist as he passed by and they furthermore said that the sharp turns in the road and the abruptness of the descent would afford us a thrilling experience for we should go down in a flying gallop and seem to be spinning around the rings of a whirlwind like a drop of whiskey descending the spirals of a corkscrew i got all the information out of these gentlemen that we could need and then to make everything complete i asked them if a body could get hold of a little fruit and milk here and there in case of necessity they threw up their hands in speechless intimation that the road was simply paved with refreshment peddlers we were impatient to get away now and the rest of our two hour stop rather dragged but finally the set time arrived and we began the ascent indeed it was a wonderful road it was smooth and compact and clean and the side next the precipices was guarded all along by dressed stone posts about three feet high placed at short distances apart the road could not have been better built if napoleon the first had built it he seems to have been the introducer of the sort of roads which europe now uses all literature which describes life as it existed in england france and germany up to the close of the last century is filled with pictures of coaches and carriages wallowing through these three countries in mud and slush half wheel deep but after napoleon had floundered through a conquered kingdom he generally arranged things so that the rest of the world could follow dry shod we went on climbing higher and higher and curving hither and thither in the shade of noble woods and with a rich variety and profusion of wild flowers all about us and glimpses of rounded grassy backbones below us occupied by trim chalets and nibbling sheep and other glimpses of far lower altitudes where distance diminished the chalets to toys and obliterated the sheep altogether and every now and then some ermined monarch of the alps swung magnificently into view for a moment then drifted past an intervening spur and disappeared again it was an intoxicating trip altogether the exceeding sense of satisfaction that follows a good dinner added largely to the enjoyment the having something especial to look forward to and muse about like the approaching grandeurs of meiringen sharpened the zest smoking was never so good before solid comfort was never solider we lay back against the thick cushions silent meditative steeped in felicity i rubbed my eyes opened them and started i had been dreaming i was at sea and it was a thrilling surprise to wake up and find land all around me it took me a couple seconds to come to as you may say then i took in the situation the horses were drinking at a trough in the edge of a town the driver was taking beer harris was snoring at my side the courier with folded arms and bowed head was sleeping on the box two dozen barefooted and bareheaded children were gathered about the carriage with their hands crossed behind gazing up with serious and innocent admiration at the dozing tourists baking there in the sun several small girls held night capped babies nearly as big as themselves in their arms and even these fat babies seemed to take a sort of sluggish interest in us we had slept an hour and a half and missed all the scenery i did not need anybody to tell me that if i had been a girl i could have cursed for vexation as it was i woke up the agent and gave him a piece of my mind instead of being humiliated he only upbraided me for being so wanting in vigilance he said he had expected to improve his mind by coming to europe but a man might travel to the ends of the earth with me and never see anything for i was manifestly endowed with the very genius of ill luck he even tried to get up some emotion about that poor courier who never got a chance to see anything on account of my heedlessness but when i thought i had borne about enough of this kind of talk i threatened to make harris tramp back to the summit and make a report on that scenery and this suggestion spiked his battery we drove sullenly through brienz dead to the seductions of its bewildering array of swiss carvings and the clamorous hoo hooing of its cuckoo clocks and had not entirely recovered our spirits when we rattled across a bridge over the rushing blue river and entered the pretty town of interlaken it was just about sunset and we had made the trip from lucerne in ten hours chapter xxxii the jungfrau the bride and the piano we located ourselves at the jungfrau hotel one of those huge establishments which the needs of modern travel have created in every attractive spot on the continent there was a great gathering at dinner and as usual one heard all sorts of languages the table dh te was served by waitresses dressed in the quaint and comely costume of the swiss peasants this consists of a simple gros de laine trimmed with ashes of roses with overskirt of scare bleu ventre saint gris cut bias on the off side with facings of petit polonaise and narrow insertions of p te de foie gras backstitched to the mise en sce ne in the form of a jeu d esprit it gives to the wearer a singularly piquant and alluring aspect one of these waitresses a woman of forty had side whiskers reaching half way down her jaws they were two fingers broad dark in color pretty thick and the hairs were an inch long one sees many women on the continent with quite conspicuous mustaches but this was the only woman i saw who had reached the dignity of whiskers after dinner the guests of both sexes distributed themselves about the front porches and the ornamental grounds belonging to the hotel to enjoy the cool air but as the twilight deepened toward darkness they gathered themselves together in that saddest and solemnest and most constrained of all places the great blank drawing room which is the chief feature of all continental summer hotels there they grouped themselves about in couples and threes and mumbled in bated voices and looked timid and homeless and forlorn there was a small piano in this room a clattery wheezy asthmatic thing certainly the very worst miscarriage in the way of a piano that the world has seen in turn five or six dejected and homesick ladies approached it doubtingly gave it a single inquiring thump and retired with the lockjaw but the boss of that instrument was to come nevertheless and from my own country from arkansaw she was a brand new bride innocent girlish happy in herself and her grave and worshiping stripling of a husband she was about eighteen just out of school free from affectations unconscious of that passionless multitude around her and the very first time she smote that old wreck one recognized that it had met its destiny her stripling brought an armful of aged sheet music from their room for this bride went heeled as you might say and bent himself lovingly over and got ready to turn the pages the bride fetched a swoop with her fingers from one end of the keyboard to the other just to get her bearings as it were and you could see the congregation set their teeth with the agony of it then without any more preliminaries she turned on all the horrors of the battle of prague that venerable shivaree and waded chin deep in the blood of the slain she made a fair and honorable average of two false notes in every five but her soul was in arms and she never stopped to correct the audience stood it with pretty fair grit for a while but when the cannonade waxed hotter and fiercer and the discord average rose to four in five the procession began to move a few stragglers held their ground ten minutes longer but when the girl began to wring the true inwardness out of the cries of the wounded they struck their colors and retired in a kind of panic there never was a completer victory i was the only non combatant left on the field i would not have deserted my countrywoman anyhow but indeed i had no desires in that direction none of us like mediocrity but we all reverence perfection this girls music was perfection in its way it was the worst music that had ever been achieved on our planet by a mere human being i moved up close and never lost a strain when she got through i asked her to play it again she did it with a pleased alacrity and a heightened enthusiasm she made it all discords this time she got an amount of anguish into the cries of the wounded that shed a new light on human suffering she was on the war path all the evening all the time crowds of people gathered on the porches and pressed their noses against the windows to look and marvel but the bravest never ventured in the bride went off satisfied and happy with her young fellow when her appetite was finally gorged and the tourists swarmed in again what a change has come over switzerland and in fact all europe during this century seventy or eighty years ago napoleon was the only man in europe who could really be called a traveler he was the only man who had devoted his attention to it and taken a powerful interest in it he was the only man who had traveled extensively but now everybody goes everywhere and switzerland and many other regions which were unvisited and unknown remotenesses a hundred years ago are in our days a buzzing hive of restless strangers every summer but i digress in the morning when we looked out of our windows we saw a wonderful sight across the valley and apparently quite neighborly and close at hand the giant form of the jungfrau rose cold and white into the clear sky beyond a gateway in the nearer highlands it reminded me somehow of one of those colossal billows which swells suddenly up beside ones ship at sea sometimes with its crest and shoulders snowy white and the rest of its noble proportions streaked downward with creamy foam i took out my sketch book and made a little picture of the jungfrau merely to get the shape i do not regard this as one of my finished works in fact i do not rank it among my works at all it is only a study it is hardly more than what one might call a sketch other artists have done me the grace to admire it but i am severe in my judgments of my own pictures and this one does not move me it was hard to believe that that lofty wooded rampart on the left which so overtops the jungfrau was not actually the higher of the two but it was not of course it is only two or three thousand feet high and of course has no snow upon it in summer whereas the jungfrau is not much shorter of fourteen thousand feet high and therefore that lowest verge of snow on her side which seems nearly down to the valley level is really about seven thousand feet higher up in the air than the summit of that wooded rampart it is the distance that makes the deception the wooded height is but four or five miles removed from us but the jungfrau is four or five times that distance away walking down the street of shops in the fore noon i was attracted by a large picture carved frame and all from a single block of chocolate colored wood there are people who know everything some of these had told us that continental shopkeepers always raise their prices on english and americans many people had told us it was expensive to buy things through a courier whereas i had supposed it was just the reverse when i saw this picture i conjectured that it was worth more than the friend i proposed to buy it for would like to pay but still it was worth while to inquire so i told the courier to step in and ask the price as if he wanted it for himself i told him not to speak in english and above all not to reveal the fact that he was a courier then i moved on a few yards and waited the courier came presently and reported the price i said to myself it is a hundred francs too much and so dismissed the matter from my mind but in the afternoon i was passing that place with harris and the picture attracted me again we stepped in to see how much higher broken german would raise the price the shopwoman named a figure just a hundred francs lower than the courier had named this was a pleasant surprise i said i would take it after i had given directions as to where it was to be shipped the shopwoman said appealingly if you please do not let your courier know you bought it this was an unexpected remark i said what makes you think i have a courier ah that is very simple he told me himself he was very thoughtful but tell me why did you charge him more than you are charging me that is very simple also i do not have to pay you a percentage oh i begin to see you would have had to pay the courier a percentage undoubtedly the courier always has his percentage in this case it would have been a hundred francs then the tradesman does not pay a part of it the purchaser pays all of it there are occasions when the tradesman and the courier agree upon a price which is twice or thrice the value of the article then the two divide and both get a percentage i see but it seems to me that the purchaser does all the paying even then oh to be sure it goes without saying but i have bought this picture myself therefore why shouldnt the courier know it the woman exclaimed in distress ah indeed it would take all my little profit he would come and demand his hundred francs and i should have to pay he has not done the buying you could refuse i could not dare to refuse he would never bring travelers here again more than that he would denounce me to the other couriers they would divert custom from me and my business would be injured i went away in a thoughtful frame of mind i began to see why a courier could afford to work for fifty five dollars a month and his fares a month or two later i was able to understand why a courier did not have to pay any board and lodging and why my hotel bills were always larger when i had him with me than when i left him behind somewhere for a few days another thing was also explained now apparently in one town i had taken the courier to the bank to do the translating when i drew some money i had sat in the reading room till the transaction was finished then a clerk had brought the money to me in person and had been exceedingly polite even going so far as to precede me to the door and holding it open for me and bow me out as if i had been a distinguished personage it was a new experience exchange had been in my favor ever since i had been in europe but just that one time i got simply the face of my draft and no extra francs whereas i had expected to get quite a number of them this was the first time i had ever used the courier at the bank i had suspected something then and as long as he remained with me afterward i managed bank matters by myself still if i felt that i could afford the tax i would never travel without a courier for a good courier is a convenience whose value cannot be estimated in dollars and cents without him travel is a bitter harassment a purgatory of little exasperating annoyances a ceaseless and pitiless punishment i mean to an irascible man who has no business capacity and is confused by details without a courier travel hasnt a ray of pleasure in it anywhere but with him it is a continuous and unruffled delight he is always at hand never has to be sent for if your bell is not answered promptly and it seldom is you have only to open the door and speak the courier will hear and he will have the order attended to or raise an insurrection you tell him what day you will start and whither you are going leave all the rest to him you need not inquire about trains or fares or car changes or hotels or anything else at the proper time he will put you in a cab or an omnibus and drive you to the train or the boat he has packed your luggage and transferred it he has paid all the bills other people have preceded you half an hour to scramble for impossible places and lose their tempers but you can take your time the courier has secured your seats for you and you can occupy them at your leisure at the station the crowd mash one another to pulp in the effort to get the weighers attention to their trunks they dispute hotly with these tyrants who are cool and indifferent they get their baggage billets at last and then have another squeeze and another rage over the disheartening business of trying to get them recorded and paid for and still another over the equally disheartening business of trying to get near enough to the ticket office to buy a ticket and now with their tempers gone to the dogs they must stand penned up and packed together laden with wraps and satchels and shawl straps with the weary wife and babies in the waiting room till the doors are thrown open and then all hands make a grand final rush to the train find it full and have to stand on the platform and fret until some more cars are put on they are in a condition to kill somebody by this time meantime you have been sitting in your car smoking and observing all this misery in the extremest comfort on the journey the guard is polite and watchful wont allow anybody to get into your compartment tells them you are just recovering from the small pox and do not like to be disturbed for the courier has made everything right with the guard at way stations the courier comes to your compartment to see if you want a glass of water or a newspaper or anything at eating stations he sends luncheon out to you while the other people scramble and worry in the dining rooms if anything breaks about the car you are in and a station master proposes to pack you and your agent into a compartment with strangers the courier reveals to him confidentially that you are a french duke born deaf and dumb and the official comes and makes affable signs that he has ordered a choice car to be added to the train for you at custom houses the multitude file tediously through hot and irritated and look on while the officers burrow into the trunks and make a mess of everything but you hand your keys to the courier and sit still perhaps you arrive at your destination in a rain storm at ten at night you generally do the multitude spend half an hour verifying their baggage and getting it transferred to the omnibuses but the courier puts you into a vehicle without a moments loss of time and when you reach your hotel you find your rooms have been secured two or three days in advance everything is ready you can go at once to bed some of those other people will have to drift around to two or three hotels in the rain before they find accommodations i have not set down half of the virtues that are vested in a good courier but i think i have set down a sufficiency of them to show that an irritable man who can afford one and does not employ him is not a wise economist my courier was the worst one in europe yet he was a good deal better than none at all it could not pay him to be a better one than he was because i could not afford to buy things through him he was a good enough courier for the small amount he got out of his service yes to travel with a courier is bliss to travel without one is the reverse i have had dealings with some very bad couriers but i have also had dealings with one who might fairly be called perfection he was a young polander named joseph n verey he spoke eight languages and seemed to be equally at home in all of them he was shrewd prompt posted and punctual he was fertile in resources and singularly gifted in the matter of overcoming difficulties he not only knew how to do everything in his line but he knew the best ways and the quickest he was handy with children and invalids all his employer needed to do was to take life easy and leave everything to the courier his address is care of messrs gay son strand london he was formerly a conductor of gays tourist parties excellent couriers are somewhat rare if the reader is about to travel he will find it to his advantage to make a note of this one chapter xxxiii we climb far by buggy the beautiful giesbach fall is near interlaken on the other side of the lake of brienz and is illuminated every night with those gorgeous theatrical fires whose name i cannot call just at this moment this was said to be a spectacle which the tourist ought by no means to miss i was strongly tempted but i could not go there with propriety because one goes in a boat the task which i had set myself was to walk over europe on foot not skim over it in a boat i had made a tacit contract with myself it was my duty to abide by it i was willing to make boat trips for pleasure but i could not conscientiously make them in the way of business it cost me something of a pang to lose that fine sight but i lived down the desire and gained in my self respect through the triumph i had a finer and a grander sight however where i was this was the mighty dome of the jungfrau softly outlined against the sky and faintly silvered by the starlight there was something subduing in the influence of that silent and solemn and awful presence one seemed to meet the immutable the indestructible the eternal face to face and to feel the trivial and fleeting nature of his own existence the more sharply by the contrast one had the sense of being under the brooding contemplation of a spirit not an inert mass of rocks and ice a spirit which had looked down through the slow drift of the ages upon a million vanished races of men and judged them and would judge a million more and still be there watching unchanged and unchangeable after all life should be gone and the earth have become a vacant desolation while i was feeling these things i was groping without knowing it toward an understanding of what the spell is which people find in the alps and in no other mountains that strange deep nameless influence which once felt cannot be forgotten once felt leaves always behind it a restless longing to feel it again a longing which is like homesickness a grieving haunting yearning which will plead implore and persecute till it has its will i met dozens of people imaginative and unimaginative cultivated and uncultivated who had come from far countries and roamed through the swiss alps year after year they could not explain why they had come first they said out of idle curiosity because everybody talked about it they had come since because they could not help it and they should keep on coming while they lived for the same reason they had tried to break their chains and stay away but it was futile now they had no desire to break them others came nearer formulating what they felt they said they could find perfect rest and peace nowhere else when they were troubled all frets and worries and chafings sank to sleep in the presence of the benignant serenity of the alps the great spirit of the mountain breathed his own peace upon their hurt minds and sore hearts and healed them they could not think base thoughts or do mean and sordid things here before the visible throne of god down the road a piece was a kursaal whatever that may be and we joined the human tide to see what sort of enjoyment it might afford it was the usual open air concert in an ornamental garden with wines beer milk whey grapes etc the whey and the grapes being necessaries of life to certain invalids whom physicians cannot repair and who only continue to exist by the grace of whey or grapes one of these departed spirits told me in a sad and lifeless way that there is no way for him to live but by whey and dearly dearly loved whey he didnt know whey he did but he did after making this pun he died that is the whey it served him some other remains preserved from decomposition by the grape system told me that the grapes were of a peculiar breed highly medicinal in their nature and that they were counted out and administered by the grape doctors as methodically as if they were pills the new patient if very feeble began with one grape before breakfast took three during breakfast a couple between meals five at luncheon three in the afternoon seven at dinner four for supper and part of a grape just before going to bed by way of a general regulator the quantity was gradually and regularly increased according to the needs and capacities of the patient until by and by you would find him disposing of his one grape per second all the day long and his regular barrel per day he said that men cured in this way and enabled to discard the grape system never afterward got over the habit of talking as if they were dictating to a slow amanuensis because they always made a pause between each two words while they sucked the substance out of an imaginary grape he said these were tedious people to talk with he said that men who had been cured by the other process were easily distinguished from the rest of mankind because they always tilted their heads back between every two words and swallowed a swig of imaginary whey he said it was an impressive thing to observe two men who had been cured by the two processes engaged in conversation said their pauses and accompanying movements were so continuous and regular that a stranger would think himself in the presence of a couple of automatic machines one finds out a great many wonderful things by traveling if he stumbles upon the right person i did not remain long at the kursaal the music was good enough but it seemed rather tame after the cyclone of that arkansaw expert besides my adventurous spirit had conceived a formidable enterprise nothing less than a trip from interlaken by the gemmi and visp clear to zermatt on foot so it was necessary to plan the details and get ready for an early start the courier this was not the one i have just been speaking of thought that the portier of the hotel would be able to tell us how to find our way and so it turned out he showed us the whole thing on a relief map and we could see our route with all its elevations and depressions its villages and its rivers as clearly as if we were sailing over it in a balloon a relief map is a great thing the portier also wrote down each days journey and the nightly hotel on a piece of paper and made our course so plain that we should never be able to get lost without high priced outside help i put the courier in the care of a gentleman who was going to lausanne and then we went to bed after laying out the walking costumes and putting them into condition for instant occupation in the morning however when we came down to breakfast at a m it looked so much like rain that i hired a two horse top buggy for the first third of the journey for two or three hours we jogged along the level road which skirts the beautiful lake of thun with a dim and dreamlike picture of watery expanses and spectral alpine forms always before us veiled in a mellowing mist then a steady downpour set in and hid everything but the nearest objects we kept the rain out of our faces with umbrellas and away from our bodies with the leather apron of the buggy but the driver sat unsheltered and placidly soaked the weather in and seemed to like it we had the road to ourselves and i never had a pleasanter excursion the weather began to clear while we were driving up a valley called the kienthal and presently a vast black cloud bank in front of us dissolved away and uncurtained the grand proportions and the soaring loftiness of the blumis alp it was a sort of breath taking surprise for we had not supposed there was anything behind that low hung blanket of sable cloud but level valley what we had been mistaking for fleeting glimpses of sky away aloft there were really patches of the blumiss snowy crest caught through shredded rents in the drifting pall of vapor we dined in the inn at frutigen and our driver ought to have dined there too but he would not have had time to dine and get drunk both so he gave his mind to making a masterpiece of the latter and succeeded a german gentleman and his two young lady daughters had been taking their nooning at the inn and when they left just ahead of us it was plain that their driver was as drunk as ours and as happy and good natured too which was saying a good deal these rascals overflowed with attentions and information for their guests and with brotherly love for each other they tied their reins and took off their coats and hats so that they might be able to give unencumbered attention to conversation and to the gestures necessary for its illustration the road was smooth it led up and over and down a continual succession of hills but it was narrow the horses were used to it and could not well get out of it anyhow so why shouldnt the drivers entertain themselves and us the noses of our horses projected sociably into the rear of the forward carriage and as we toiled up the long hills our driver stood up and talked to his friend and his friend stood up and talked back to him with his rear to the scenery when the top was reached and we went flying down the other side there was no change in the program i carry in my memory yet the picture of that forward driver on his knees on his high seat resting his elbows on its back and beaming down on his passengers with happy eye and flying hair and jolly red face and offering his card to the old german gentleman while he praised his hack and horses and both teams were whizzing down a long hill with nobody in a position to tell whether we were bound to destruction or an undeserved safety toward sunset we entered a beautiful green valley dotted with chalets a cozy little domain hidden away from the busy world in a cloistered nook among giant precipices topped with snowy peaks that seemed to float like islands above the curling surf of the sea of vapor that severed them from the lower world down from vague and vaporous heights little ruffled zigzag milky currents came crawling and found their way to the verge of one of those tremendous overhanging walls whence they plunged a shaft of silver shivered to atoms in mid descent and turned to an air puff of luminous dust here and there in grooved depressions among the snowy desolations of the upper altitudes one glimpsed the extremity of a glacier with its sea green and honeycombed battlements of ice up the valley under a dizzy precipice nestled the village of kandersteg our halting place for the night we were soon there and housed in the hotel but the waning day had such an inviting influence that we did not remain housed many moments but struck out and followed a roaring torrent of ice water up to its far source in a sort of little grass carpeted parlor walled in all around by vast precipices and overlooked by clustering summits of ice this was the snuggest little croquet ground imaginable it was perfectly level and not more than a mile long by half a mile wide the walls around it were so gigantic and everything about it was on so mighty a scale that it was belittled by contrast to what i have likened it to a cozy and carpeted parlor it was so high above the kandersteg valley that there was nothing between it and the snowy peaks i had never been in such intimate relations with the high altitudes before the snow peaks had always been remote and unapproachable grandeurs hitherto but now we were hob a nob if one may use such a seemingly irreverent expression about creations so august as these we could see the streams which fed the torrent we had followed issuing from under the greenish ramparts of glaciers but two or three of these instead of flowing over the precipices sank down into the rock and sprang in big jets out of holes in the mid face of the walls the green nook which i have been describing is called the gasternthal the glacier streams gather and flow through it in a broad and rushing brook to a narrow cleft between lofty precipices here the rushing brook becomes a mad torrent and goes booming and thundering down toward kandersteg lashing and thrashing its way over and among monster boulders and hurling chance roots and logs about like straws there was no lack of cascades along this route the path by the side of the torrent was so narrow that one had to look sharp when he heard a cow bell and hunt for a place that was wide enough to accommodate a cow and a christian side by side and such places were not always to be had at an instants notice the cows wear church bells and that is a good idea in the cows for where that torrent is you couldnt hear an ordinary cow bell any further than you could hear the ticking of a watch i needed exercise so i employed my agent in setting stranded logs and dead trees adrift and i sat on a boulder and watched them go whirling and leaping head over heels down the boiling torrent it was a wonderfully exhilarating spectacle when i had had enough exercise i made the agent take some by running a race with one of those logs i made a trifle by betting on the log after dinner we had a walk up and down the kandersteg valley in the soft gloaming with the spectacle of the dying lights of day playing about the crests and pinnacles of the still and solemn upper realm for contrast and text for talk there were no sounds but the dulled complaining of the torrent and the occasional tinkling of a distant bell the spirit of the place was a sense of deep pervading peace one might dream his life tranquilly away there and not miss it or mind it when it was gone the summer departed with the sun and winter came with the stars it grew to be a bitter night in that little hotel backed up against a precipice that had no visible top to it but we kept warm and woke in time in the morning to find that everybody else had left for gemmi three hours before so our little plan of helping that german family principally the old man over the pass was a blocked generosity chapter xxxiv the worlds highest pig farm we hired the only guide left to lead us on our way he was over seventy but he could have given me nine tenths of his strength and still had all his age entitled him to he shouldered our satchels overcoats and alpenstocks and we set out up the steep path it was hot work the old man soon begged us to hand over our coats and waistcoats to him to carry too and we did it one could not refuse so little a thing to a poor old man like that he should have had them if he had been a hundred and fifty when we began that ascent we could see a microscopic chalet perched away up against heaven on what seemed to be the highest mountain near us it was on our right across the narrow head of the valley but when we got up abreast it on its own level mountains were towering high above on every hand and we saw that its altitude was just about that of the little gasternthal which we had visited the evening before still it seemed a long way up in the air in that waste and lonely wilderness of rocks it had an unfenced grass plot in front of it which seemed about as big as a billiard table and this grass plot slanted so sharply downward and was so brief and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge of the absolute precipice that it was a shuddery thing to think of a persons venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all suppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard there would be nothing for him to seize nothing could keep him from rolling five revolutions would bring him to the edge and over he would go what a frightful distance he would fall for there are very few birds that fly as high as his starting point he would strike and bounce two or three times on his way down but this would be no advantage to him i would as soon take an airing on the slant of a rainbow as in such a front yard i would rather in fact for the distance down would be about the same and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce i could not see how the peasants got up to that chalet the region seemed too steep for anything but a balloon as we strolled on climbing up higher and higher we were continually bringing neighboring peaks into view and lofty prominence which had been hidden behind lower peaks before so by and by while standing before a group of these giants we looked around for the chalet again there it was away down below us apparently on an inconspicuous ridge in the valley it was as far below us now as it had been above us when we were beginning the ascent after a while the path led us along a railed precipice and we looked over far beneath us was the snug parlor again the little gasternthal with its water jets spouting from the face of its rock walls we could have dropped a stone into it we had been finding the top of the world all along and always finding a still higher top stealing into view in a disappointing way just ahead when we looked down into the gasternthal we felt pretty sure that we had reached the genuine top at last but it was not so there were much higher altitudes to be scaled yet we were still in the pleasant shade of forest trees we were still in a region which was cushioned with beautiful mosses and aglow with the many tinted luster of innumerable wild flowers we found indeed more interest in the wild flowers than in anything else we gathered a specimen or two of every kind which we were unacquainted with so we had sumptuous bouquets but one of the chief interests lay in chasing the seasons of the year up the mountain and determining them by the presence of flowers and berries which we were acquainted with for instance it was the end of august at the level of the sea in the kandersteg valley at the base of the pass we found flowers which would not be due at the sea level for two or three weeks higher up we entered october and gathered fringed gentians i made no notes and have forgotten the details but the construction of the floral calendar was very entertaining while it lasted in the high regions we found rich store of the splendid red flower called the alpine rose but we did not find any examples of the ugly swiss favorite called edelweiss its name seems to indicate that it is a noble flower and that it is white it may be noble enough but it is not attractive and it is not white the fuzzy blossom is the color of bad cigar ashes and appears to be made of a cheap quality of gray plush it has a noble and distant way of confining itself to the high altitudes but that is probably on account of its looks it apparently has no monopoly of those upper altitudes however for they are sometimes intruded upon by some of the loveliest of the valley families of wild flowers everybody in the alps wears a sprig of edelweiss in his hat it is the natives pet and also the tourists all the morning as we loafed along having a good time other pedestrians went staving by us with vigorous strides and with the intent and determined look of men who were walking for a wager these wore loose knee breeches long yarn stockings and hobnailed high laced walking shoes they were gentlemen who would go home to england or germany and tell how many miles they had beaten the guide book every day but i doubted if they ever had much real fun outside of the mere magnificent exhilaration of the tramp through the green valleys and the breezy heights for they were almost always alone and even the finest scenery loses incalculably when there is no one to enjoy it with all the morning an endless double procession of mule mounted tourists filed past us along the narrow path the one procession going the other coming we had taken a good deal of trouble to teach ourselves the kindly german custom of saluting all strangers with doffed hat and we resolutely clung to it that morning although it kept us bareheaded most of the time and was not always responded to still we found an interest in the thing because we naturally liked to know who were english and americans among the passers by all continental natives responded of course so did some of the english and americans but as a general thing these two races gave no sign whenever a man or a woman showed us cold neglect we spoke up confidently in our own tongue and asked for such information as we happened to need and we always got a reply in the same language the english and american folk are not less kindly than other races they are only more reserved and that comes of habit and education in one dreary rocky waste away above the line of vegetation we met a procession of twenty five mounted young men all from america we got answering bows enough from these of course for they were of an age to learn to do in rome as rome does without much effort at one extremity of this patch of desolation overhung by bare and forbidding crags which husbanded drifts of everlasting snow in their shaded cavities was a small stretch of thin and discouraged grass and a man and a family of pigs were actually living here in some shanties consequently this place could be really reckoned as property it had a money value and was doubtless taxed i think it must have marked the limit of real estate in this world it would be hard to set a money value upon any piece of earth that lies between that spot and the empty realm of space that man may claim the distinction of owning the end of the world for if there is any definite end to the world he has certainly found it from here forward we moved through a storm swept and smileless desolation all about us rose gigantic masses crags and ramparts of bare and dreary rock with not a vestige or semblance of plant or tree or flower anywhere or glimpse of any creature that had life the frost and the tempests of unnumbered ages had battered and hacked at these cliffs with a deathless energy destroying them piecemeal so all the region about their bases was a tumbled chaos of great fragments which had been split off and hurled to the ground soiled and aged banks of snow lay close about our path the ghastly desolation of the place was as tremendously complete as if dor had furnished the working plans for it but every now and then through the stern gateways around us we caught a view of some neighboring majestic dome sheathed with glittering ice and displaying its white purity at an elevation compared to which ours was groveling and plebeian and this spectacle always chained ones interest and admiration at once and made him forget there was anything ugly in the world i have just said that there was nothing but death and desolation in these hideous places but i forgot in the most forlorn and arid and dismal one of all where the racked and splintered debris was thickest where the ancient patches of snow lay against the very path where the winds blew bitterest and the general aspect was mournfulest and dreariest and furthest from any suggestion of cheer or hope i found a solitary wee forget me not flourishing away not a droop about it anywhere but holding its bright blue star up with the prettiest and gallantest air in the world the only happy spirit the only smiling thing in all that grisly desert she seemed to say cheer up as long as we are here let us make the best of it i judged she had earned a right to a more hospitable place so i plucked her up and sent her to america to a friend who would respect her for the fight she had made all by her small self to make a whole vast despondent alpine desolation stop breaking its heart over the unalterable and hold up its head and look at the bright side of things for once we stopped for a nooning at a strongly built little inn called the schwarenbach it sits in a lonely spot among the peaks where it is swept by the trailing fringes of the cloud rack and is rained on and snowed on and pelted and persecuted by the storms nearly every day of its life it was the only habitation in the whole gemmi pass close at hand now was a chance for a blood curdling alpine adventure close at hand was the snowy mass of the great altels cooling its topknot in the sky and daring us to an ascent i was fired with the idea and immediately made up my mind to procure the necessary guides ropes etc and undertake it i instructed harris to go to the landlord of the inn and set him about our preparations meantime i went diligently to work to read up and find out what this much talked of mountain climbing was like and how one should go about it for in these matters i was ignorant i opened mr hinchliffs summer months among the alps published and selected his account of his ascent of monte rosa it began it is very difficult to free the mind from excitement on the evening before a grand expedition i saw that i was too calm so i walked the room a while and worked myself into a high excitement but the books next remark that the adventurer must get up at two in the morning came as near as anything to flatting it all out again however i reinforced it and read on about how mr hinchliff dressed by candle light and was soon down among the guides who were bustling about in the passage packing provisions and making every preparation for the start and how he glanced out into the cold clear night and saw that the whole sky was blazing with stars larger and brighter than they appear through the dense atmosphere breathed by inhabitants of the lower parts of the earth they seemed actually suspended from the dark vault of heaven and their gentle light shed a fairylike gleam over the snow fields around the foot of the matterhorn which raised its stupendous pinnacle on high penetrating to the heart of the great bear and crowning itself with a diadem of his magnificent stars not a sound disturbed the deep tranquillity of the night except the distant roar of streams which rush from the high plateau of the st theodule glacier and fall headlong over precipitous rocks till they lose themselves in the mazes of the gorner glacier he took his hot toast and coffee and then about half past three his caravan of ten men filed away from the riffel hotel and began the steep climb at half past five he happened to turn around and beheld the glorious spectacle of the matterhorn just touched by the rosy fingered morning and looking like a huge pyramid of fire rising out of the barren ocean of ice and rock around it then the breithorn and the dent blanche caught the radiant glow but the intervening mass of monte rosa made it necessary for us to climb many long hours before we could hope to see the sun himself yet the whole air soon grew warmer after the splendid birth of the day he gazed at the lofty crown of monte rosa and the wastes of snow that guarded its steep approaches and the chief guide delivered the opinion that no man could conquer their awful heights and put his foot upon that summit but the adventurers moved steadily on nevertheless they toiled up and up and still up they passed the grand plateau then toiled up a steep shoulder of the mountain clinging like flies to its rugged face and now they were confronted by a tremendous wall from which great blocks of ice and snow were evidently in the habit of falling they turned aside to skirt this wall and gradually ascended until their way was barred by a maze of gigantic snow crevices so they turned aside again and began a long climb of sufficient steepness to make a zigzag course necessary fatigue compelled them to halt frequently for a moment or two at one of these halts somebody called out look at mont blanc and we were at once made aware of the very great height we had attained by actually seeing the monarch of the alps and his attendant satellites right over the top of the breithorn itself at least feet high these people moved in single file and were all tied to a strong rope at regular distances apart so that if one of them slipped on those giddy heights the others could brace themselves on their alpenstocks and save him from darting into the valley thousands of feet below by and by they came to an ice coated ridge which was tilted up at a sharp angle and had a precipice on one side of it they had to climb this so the guide in the lead cut steps in the ice with his hatchet and as fast as he took his toes out of one of these slight holes the toes of the man behind him occupied it slowly and steadily we kept on our way over this dangerous part of the ascent and i dare say it was fortunate for some of us that attention was distracted from the head by the paramount necessity of looking after the feet for while on the left the incline of ice was so steep that it would be impossible for any man to save himself in case of a slip unless the others could hold him up on the right we might drop a pebble from the hand over precipices of unknown extent down upon the tremendous glacier below great caution therefore was absolutely necessary and in this exposed situation we were attacked by all the fury of that grand enemy of aspirants to monte rosa a severe and bitterly cold wind from the north the fine powdery snow was driven past us in the clouds penetrating the interstices of our clothes and the pieces of ice which flew from the blows of peters ax were whisked into the air and then dashed over the precipice we had quite enough to do to prevent ourselves from being served in the same ruthless fashion and now and then in the more violent gusts of wind were glad to stick our alpenstocks into the ice and hold on hard having surmounted this perilous steep they sat down and took a brief rest with their backs against a sheltering rock and their heels dangling over a bottomless abyss then they climbed to the base of another ridge a more difficult and dangerous one still the whole of the ridge was exceedingly narrow and the fall on each side desperately steep but the ice in some of these intervals between the masses of rock assumed the form of a mere sharp edge almost like a knife these places though not more than three or four short paces in length looked uncommonly awkward but like the sword leading true believers to the gates of paradise they must needs be passed before we could attain to the summit of our ambition these were in one or two places so narrow that in stepping over them with toes well turned out for greater security one end of the foot projected over the awful precipice on the right while the other was on the beginning of the ice slope on the left which was scarcely less steep than the rocks on these occasions peter would take my hand and each of us stretching as far as we could he was thus enabled to get a firm footing two paces or rather more from me whence a spring would probably bring him to the rock on the other side then turning around he called to me to come and taking a couple of steps carefully i was met at the third by his outstretched hand ready to clasp mine and in a moment stood by his side the others followed in much the same fashion once my right foot slipped on the side toward the precipice but i threw out my left arm in a moment so that it caught the icy edge under my armpit as i fell and supported me considerably at the same instant i cast my eyes down the side on which i had slipped and contrived to plant my right foot on a piece of rock as large as a cricket ball which chanced to protrude through the ice on the very edge of the precipice being thus anchored fore and aft as it were i believe i could easily have recovered myself even if i had been alone though it must be confessed the situation would have been an awful one as it was however a jerk from peter settled the matter very soon and i was on my legs all right in an instant the rope is an immense help in places of this kind now they arrived at the base of a great knob or dome veneered with ice and powdered with snow the utmost summit the last bit of solidity between them and the hollow vault of heaven they set to work with their hatchets and were soon creeping insectlike up its surface with their heels projecting over the thinnest kind of nothingness thickened up a little with a few wandering shreds and films of cloud moving in a lazy procession far below presently one mans toe hold broke and he fell there he dangled in mid air at the end of the rope like a spider till his friends above hauled him into place again a little bit later the party stood upon the wee pedestal of the very summit in a driving wind and looked out upon the vast green expanses of italy and a shoreless ocean of billowy alps when i had read thus far harris broke into the room in a noble excitement and said the ropes and the guides were secured and asked if i was ready i said i believed i wouldnt ascend the altels this time i said alp climbing was a different thing from what i had supposed it was and so i judged we had better study its points a little more before we went definitely into it but i told him to retain the guides and order them to follow us to zermatt because i meant to use them there i said i could feel the spirit of adventure beginning to stir in me and was sure that the fell fascination of alp climbing would soon be upon me i said he could make up his mind to it that we would do a deed before we were a week older which would make the hair of the timid curl with fright this made harris happy and filled him with ambitious anticipations he went at once to tell the guides to follow us to zermatt and bring all their paraphernalia with them chapter xxxv swindling the coroner a great and priceless thing is a new interest how it takes possession of a man how it clings to him how it rides him i strode onward from the schwarenbach hostelry a changed man a reorganized personality i walked into a new world i saw with new eyes i had been looking aloft at the giant show peaks only as things to be worshiped for their grandeur and magnitude and their unspeakable grace of form i looked up at them now as also things to be conquered and climbed my sense of their grandeur and their noble beauty was neither lost nor impaired i had gained a new interest in the mountains without losing the old ones i followed the steep lines up inch by inch with my eye and noted the possibility or impossibility of following them with my feet when i saw a shining helmet of ice projecting above the clouds i tried to imagine i saw files of black specks toiling up it roped together with a gossamer thread we skirted the lonely little lake called the daubensee and presently passed close by a glacier on the right a thing like a great river frozen solid in its flow and broken square off like a wall at its mouth i had never been so near a glacier before here we came upon a new board shanty and found some men engaged in building a stone house so the schwarenbach was soon to have a rival we bought a bottle or so of beer here at any rate they called it beer but i knew by the price that it was dissolved jewelry and i perceived by the taste that dissolved jewelry is not good stuff to drink we were surrounded by a hideous desolation we stepped forward to a sort of jumping off place and were confronted by a startling contrast we seemed to look down into fairyland two or three thousand feet below us was a bright green level with a pretty town in its midst and a silvery stream winding among the meadows the charming spot was walled in on all sides by gigantic precipices clothed with pines and over the pines out of the softened distances rose the snowy domes and peaks of the monte rosa region how exquisitely green and beautiful that little valley down there was the distance was not great enough to obliterate details it only made them little and mellow and dainty like landscapes and towns seen through the wrong end of a spy glass right under us a narrow ledge rose up out of the valley with a green slanting bench shaped top and grouped about upon this green baize bench were a lot of black and white sheep which looked merely like oversized worms the bench seemed lifted well up into our neighborhood but that was a deception it was a long way down to it we began our descent now by the most remarkable road i have ever seen it wound its corkscrew curves down the face of the colossal precipice a narrow way with always the solid rock wall at one elbow and perpendicular nothingness at the other we met an everlasting procession of guides porters mules litters and tourists climbing up this steep and muddy path and there was no room to spare when you had to pass a tolerably fat mule i always took the inside when i heard or saw the mule coming and flattened myself against the wall i preferred the inside of course but i should have had to take it anyhow because the mule prefers the outside a mules preference on a precipice is a thing to be respected well his choice is always the outside his life is mostly devoted to carrying bulky panniers and packages which rest against his body therefore he is habituated to taking the outside edge of mountain paths to keep his bundles from rubbing against rocks or banks on the other when he goes into the passenger business he absurdly clings to his old habit and keeps one leg of his passenger always dangling over the great deeps of the lower world while that passengers heart is in the highlands so to speak more than once i saw a mules hind foot cave over the outer edge and send earth and rubbish into the bottom abyss and i noticed that upon these occasions the rider whether male or female looked tolerably unwell there was one place where an eighteen inch breadth of light masonry had been added to the verge of the path and as there was a very sharp turn here a panel of fencing had been set up there at some time as a protection this panel was old and gray and feeble and the light masonry had been loosened by recent rains a young american girl came along on a mule and in making the turn the mules hind foot caved all the loose masonry and one of the fence posts overboard the mule gave a violent lurch inboard to save himself and succeeded in the effort but that girl turned as white as the snows of mont blanc for a moment the path was simply a groove cut into the face of the precipice there was a four foot breadth of solid rock under the traveler and four foot breadth of solid rock just above his head like the roof of a narrow porch he could look out from this gallery and see a sheer summitless and bottomless wall of rock before him across a gorge or crack a biscuits toss in width but he could not see the bottom of his own precipice unless he lay down and projected his nose over the edge i did not do this because i did not wish to soil my clothes every few hundred yards at particularly bad places one came across a panel or so of plank fencing but they were always old and weak and they generally leaned out over the chasm and did not make any rash promises to hold up people who might need support there was one of these panels which had only its upper board left a pedestrianizing english youth came tearing down the path was seized with an impulse to look over the precipice and without an instants thought he threw his weight upon that crazy board it bent outward a foot i never made a gasp before that came so near suffocating me the english youths face simply showed a lively surprise but nothing more he went swinging along valleyward again as if he did not know he had just swindled a coroner by the closest kind of a shave the alpine litter is sometimes like a cushioned box made fast between the middles of two long poles and sometimes it is a chair with a back to it and a support for the feet it is carried by relays of strong porters the motion is easier than that of any other conveyance we met a few men and a great many ladies in litters it seemed to me that most of the ladies looked pale and nauseated their general aspect gave me the idea that they were patiently enduring a horrible suffering as a rule they looked at their laps and left the scenery to take care of itself but the most frightened creature i saw was a led horse that overtook us poor fellow he had been born and reared in the grassy levels of the kandersteg valley and had never seen anything like this hideous place before every few steps he would stop short glance wildly out from the dizzy height and then spread his red nostrils wide and pant as violently as if he had been running a race and all the while he quaked from head to heel as with a palsy he was a handsome fellow and he made a fine statuesque picture of terror but it was pitiful to see him suffer so this dreadful path has had its tragedy baedeker with his customary over terseness begins and ends the tale thus the descent on horseback should be avoided in a comtesse d herlincourt fell from her saddle over the precipice and was killed on the spot we looked over the precipice there and saw the monument which commemorates the event it stands in the bottom of the gorge in a place which has been hollowed out of the rock to protect it from the torrent and the storms our old guide never spoke but when spoken to and then limited himself to a syllable or two but when we asked him about this tragedy he showed a strong interest in the matter he said the countess was very pretty and very young hardly out of her girlhood in fact she was newly married and was on her bridal tour the young husband was riding a little in advance one guide was leading the husbands horse another was leading the brides the old man continued the guide that was leading the husbands horse happened to glance back and there was that poor young thing sitting up staring out over the precipice and her face began to bend downward a little and she put up her two hands slowly and met it so and put them flat against her eyes so and then she sank out of the saddle with a sharp shriek and one caught only the flash of a dress and it was all over then after a pause ah yes that guide saw these things yes he saw them all he saw them all just as i have told you after another pause ah yes he saw them all my god that was me i was that guide this had been the one event of the old mans life so one may be sure he had forgotten no detail connected with it we listened to all he had to say about what was done and what happened and what was said after the sorrowful occurrence and a painful story it was when we had wound down toward the valley until we were about on the last spiral of the corkscrew harriss hat blew over the last remaining bit of precipice a small cliff a hundred or hundred and fifty feet high and sailed down toward a steep slant composed of rough chips and fragments which the weather had flaked away from the precipices we went leisurely down there expecting to find it without any trouble but we had made a mistake as to that we hunted during a couple of hours not because the old straw hat was valuable but out of curiosity to find out how such a thing could manage to conceal itself in open ground where there was nothing left for it to hide behind when one is reading in bed and lays his paper knife down he cannot find it again if it is smaller than a saber that hat was as stubborn as any paper knife could have been and we finally had to give it up but we found a fragment that had once belonged to an opera glass and by digging around and turning over the rocks we gradually collected all the lenses and the cylinders and the various odds and ends that go to making up a complete opera glass we afterward had the thing reconstructed and the owner can have his adventurous lost property by submitting proofs and paying costs of rehabilitation we had hopes of finding the owner there distributed around amongst the rocks for it would have made an elegant paragraph but we were disappointed still we were far from being disheartened for there was a considerable area which we had not thoroughly searched we were satisfied he was there somewhere so we resolved to wait over a day at leuk and come back and get him then we sat down to polish off the perspiration and arrange about what we would do with him when we got him harris was for contributing him to the british museum but i was for mailing him to his widow that is the difference between harris and me harris is all for display i am all for the simple right even though i lose money by it harris argued in favor of his proposition against mine i argued in favor of mine and against his the discussion warmed into a dispute the dispute warmed into a quarrel i finally said very decidedly my mind is made up he goes to the widow harris answered sharply and my mind is made up he goes to the museum i said calmly the museum may whistle when it gets him harris retorted the widow may save herself the trouble of whistling for i will see that she never gets him after some angry bandying of epithets i said it seems to me that you are taking on a good many airs about these remains i dont quite see what you ve got to say about them i i ve got all to say about them theyd never have been thought of if i hadnt found their opera glass the corpse belongs to me and i ll do as i please with him i was leader of the expedition and all discoveries achieved by it naturally belonged to me i was entitled to these remains and could have enforced my right but rather than have bad blood about the matter i said we would toss up for them i threw heads and won but it was a barren victory for although we spent all the next day searching we never found a bone i cannot imagine what could ever have become of that fellow the town in the valley is called leuk or leukerbad we pointed our course toward it down a verdant slope which was adorned with fringed gentians and other flowers and presently entered the narrow alleys of the outskirts and waded toward the middle of the town through liquid fertilizer they ought to either pave that village or organize a ferry harriss body was simply a chamois pasture his person was populous with the little hungry pests his skin when he stripped was splotched like a scarlet fever patients so when we were about to enter one of the leukerbad inns and he noticed its sign chamois hotel he refused to stop there he said the chamois was plentiful enough without hunting up hotels where they made a specialty of it i was indifferent for the chamois is a creature that will neither bite me nor abide with me but to calm harris we went to the h tel des alpes at the table dh te we had this for an incident a very grave man in fact his gravity amounted to solemnity and almost to austerity sat opposite us and he was tight but doing his best to appear sober he took up a corked bottle of wine tilted it over his glass awhile then set it out of the way with a contented look and went on with his dinner presently he put his glass to his mouth and of course found it empty he looked puzzled and glanced furtively and suspiciously out of the corner of his eye at a benignant and unconscious old lady who sat at his right shook his head as much as to say no she couldnt have done it he tilted the corked bottle over his glass again meantime searching around with his watery eye to see if anybody was watching him he ate a few mouthfuls raised his glass to his lips and of course it was still empty he bent an injured and accusing side glance upon that unconscious old lady which was a study to see she went on eating and gave no sign he took up his glass and his bottle with a wise private nod of his head and set them gravely on the left hand side of his plate poured himself another imaginary drink went to work with his knife and fork once more presently lifted his glass with good confidence and found it empty as usual this was almost a petrifying surprise he straightened himself up in his chair and deliberately and sorrowfully inspected the busy old ladies at his elbows first one and then the other at last he softly pushed his plate away set his glass directly in front of him held on to it with his left hand and proceeded to pour with his right this time he observed that nothing came he turned the bottle clear upside down still nothing issued from it a plaintive look came into his face and he said as if to himself ic they ve got it all then he set the bottle down resignedly and took the rest of his dinner dry it was at that table dh te too that i had under inspection the largest lady i have ever seen in private life she was over seven feet high and magnificently proportioned what had first called my attention to her was my stepping on an outlying flange of her foot and hearing from up toward the ceiling a deep pardonm sieu but you encroach that was when we were coming through the hall and the place was dim and i could see her only vaguely the thing which called my attention to her the second time was that at a table beyond ours were two very pretty girls and this great lady came in and sat down between them and me and blotted out my view she had a handsome face and she was very finely formed perfectly formed i should say but she made everybody around her look trivial and commonplace ladies near her looked like children and the men about her looked mean they looked like failures and they looked as if they felt so too she sat with her back to us i never saw such a back in my life i would have so liked to see the moon rise over it the whole congregation waited under one pretext or another till she finished her dinner and went out they wanted to see her at full altitude and they found it worth tarrying for she filled ones idea of what an empress ought to be when she rose up in her unapproachable grandeur and moved superbly out of that place we were not at leuk in time to see her at her heaviest weight she had suffered from corpulence and had come there to get rid of her extra flesh in the baths five weeks of soaking five uninterrupted hours of it every day had accomplished her purpose and reduced her to the right proportions those baths remove fat and also skin diseases the patients remain in the great tanks for hours at a time a dozen gentlemen and ladies occupy a tank together and amuse themselves with rompings and various games they have floating desks and tables and they read or lunch or play chess in water that is breast deep the tourist can step in and view this novel spectacle if he chooses theres a poor box and he will have to contribute there are several of these big bathing houses and you can always tell when you are near one of them by the romping noises and shouts of laughter that proceed from it the water is running water and changes all the time else a patient with a ringworm might take the bath with only a partial success since while he was ridding himself of the ringworm he might catch the itch the next morning we wandered back up the green valley leisurely with the curving walls of those bare and stupendous precipices rising into the clouds before us i had never seen a clean bare precipice stretching up five thousand feet above me before and i never shall expect to see another one they exist perhaps but not in places where one can easily get close to them this pile of stone is peculiar from its base to the soaring tops of its mighty towers all its lines and all its details vaguely suggest human architecture there are rudimentary bow windows cornices chimneys demarcations of stories etc one could sit and stare up there and study the features and exquisite graces of this grand structure bit by bit and day after day and never weary his interest the termination toward the town observed in profile is the perfection of shape it comes down out of the clouds in a succession of rounded colossal terracelike projections a stairway for the gods at its head spring several lofty storm scarred towers one after another with faint films of vapor curling always about them like spectral banners if there were a king whose realms included the whole world here would be the place meet and proper for such a monarch he would only need to hollow it out and put in the electric light he could give audience to a nation at a time under its roof our search for those remains having failed we inspected with a glass the dim and distant track of an old time avalanche that once swept down from some pine grown summits behind the town and swept away the houses and buried the people then we struck down the road that leads toward the rhone to see the famous ladders these perilous things are built against the perpendicular face of a cliff two or three hundred feet high the peasants of both sexes were climbing up and down them with heavy loads on their backs i ordered harris to make the ascent so i could put the thrill and horror of it in my book and he accomplished the feat successfully through a subagent for three francs which i paid it makes me shudder yet when i think of what i felt when i was clinging there between heaven and earth in the person of that proxy at times the world swam around me and i could hardly keep from letting go so dizzying was the appalling danger many a person would have given up and descended but i stuck to my task and would not yield until i had accomplished it i felt a just pride in my exploit but i would not have repeated it for the wealth of the world i shall break my neck yet with some such foolhardy performance for warnings never seem to have any lasting effect on me when the people of the hotel found that i had been climbing those crazy ladders it made me an object of considerable attention next morning early we drove to the rhone valley and took the train for visp there we shouldered our knapsacks and things and set out on foot in a tremendous rain up the winding gorge toward zermatt hour after hour we slopped along by the roaring torrent and under noble lesser alps which were clothed in rich velvety green all the way up and had little atomy swiss homes perched upon grassy benches along their mist dimmed heights the rain continued to pour and the torrent to boom and we continued to enjoy both at the one spot where this torrent tossed its white mane highest and thundered loudest and lashed the big boulders fiercest the canton had done itself the honor to build the flimsiest wooden bridge that exists in the world while we were walking over it along with a party of horsemen i noticed that even the larger raindrops made it shake i called harriss attention to it and he noticed it too it seemed to me that if i owned an elephant that was a keepsake and i thought a good deal of him i would think twice before i would ride him over that bridge we climbed up to the village of st nicholas about half past four in the afternoon waded ankle deep through the fertilizer juice and stopped at a new and nice hotel close by the little church we stripped and went to bed and sent our clothes down to be baked and the horde of soaked tourists did the same that chaos of clothing got mixed in the kitchen and there were consequences i did not get back the same drawers i sent down when our things came up at six fifteen i got a pair on a new plan they were merely a pair of white ruffle cuffed absurdities hitched together at the top with a narrow band and they did not come quite down to my knees they were pretty enough but they made me feel like two people and disconnected at that the man must have been an idiot that got himself up like that to rough it in the swiss mountains the shirt they brought me was shorter than the drawers and hadnt any sleeves to it at least it hadnt anything more than what mr darwin would call rudimentary sleeves these had edging around them but the bosom was ridiculously plain the knit silk undershirt they brought me was on a new plan and was really a sensible thing it opened behind and had pockets in it to put your shoulder blades in but they did not seem to fit mine and so i found it a sort of uncomfortable garment they gave my bobtail coat to somebody else and sent me an ulster suitable for a giraffe i had to tie my collar on because there was no button behind on that foolish little shirt which i described a while ago when i was dressed for dinner at six thirty i was too loose in some places and too tight in others and altogether i felt slovenly and ill conditioned however the people at the table dh te were no better off than i was they had everybodys clothes but their own on a long stranger recognized his ulster as soon as he saw the tail of it following me in but nobody claimed my shirt or my drawers though i described them as well as i was able i gave them to the chambermaid that night when i went to bed and she probably found the owner for my own things were on a chair outside my door in the morning there was a lovable english clergyman who did not get to the table dh te at all his breeches had turned up missing and without any equivalent he said he was not more particular than other people but he had noticed that a clergyman at dinner without any breeches was almost sure to excite remark a tramp abroad part by mark twain samuel l clemens first published in

chapter xxxvi the fiendish fun of alp climbing we did not oversleep at st nicholas the church bell began to ring at four thirty in the morning and from the length of time it continued to ring i judged that it takes the swiss sinner a good while to get the invitation through his head most church bells in the world are of poor quality and have a harsh and rasping sound which upsets the temper and produces much sin but the st nicholas bell is a good deal the worst one that has been contrived yet and is peculiarly maddening in its operation still it may have its right and its excuse to exist for the community is poor and not every citizen can afford a clock perhaps but there cannot be any excuse for our church bells at home for there is no family in america without a clock and consequently there is no fair pretext for the usual sunday medley of dreadful sounds that issues from our steeples there is much more profanity in america on sunday than in all in the other six days of the week put together and it is of a more bitter and malignant character than the week day profanity too it is produced by the cracked pot clangor of the cheap church bells we build our churches almost without regard to cost we rear an edifice which is an adornment to the town and we gild it and fresco it and mortgage it and do everything we can think of to perfect it and then spoil it all by putting a bell on it which afflicts everybody who hears it giving some the headache others st vituss dance and the rest the blind staggers an american village at ten o clock on a summer sunday is the quietest and peacefulest and holiest thing in nature but it is a pretty different thing half an hour later mr poes poem of the bells stands incomplete to this day but it is well enough that it is so for the public reciter or reader who goes around trying to imitate the sounds of the various sorts of bells with his voice would find himself up a stump when he got to the church bell as joseph addison would say the church is always trying to get other people to reform it might not be a bad idea to reform itself a little by way of example it is still clinging to one or two things which were useful once but which are not useful now neither are they ornamental one is the bell ringing to remind a clock caked town that it is church time and another is the reading from the pulpit of a tedious list of notices which everybody who is interested has already read in the newspaper the clergyman even reads the hymn through a relic of an ancient time when hymn books are scarce and costly but everybody has a hymn book now and so the public reading is no longer necessary it is not merely unnecessary it is generally painful for the average clergyman could not fire into his congregation with a shotgun and hit a worse reader than himself unless the weapon scattered shamefully i am not meaning to be flippant and irreverent i am only meaning to be truthful the average clergyman in all countries and of all denominations is a very bad reader one would think he would at least learn how to read the lords prayer by and by but it is not so he races through it as if he thought the quicker he got it in the sooner it would be answered a person who does not appreciate the exceeding value of pauses and does not know how to measure their duration judiciously cannot render the grand simplicity and dignity of a composition like that effectively we took a tolerably early breakfast and tramped off toward zermatt through the reeking lanes of the village glad to get away from that bell by and by we had a fine spectacle on our right it was the wall like butt end of a huge glacier which looked down on us from an alpine height which was well up in the blue sky it was an astonishing amount of ice to be compacted together in one mass we ciphered upon it and decided that it was not less than several hundred feet from the base of the wall of solid ice to the top of it harris believed it was really twice that we judged that if st pauls st peters the great pyramid the strasburg cathedral and the capitol in washington were clustered against that wall a man sitting on its upper edge could not hang his hat on the top of any one of them without reaching down three or four hundred feet a thing which of course no man could do to me that mighty glacier was very beautiful i did not imagine that anybody could find fault with it but i was mistaken harris had been snarling for several days he was a rabid protestant and he was always saying in the protestant cantons you never see such poverty and dirt and squalor as you do in this catholic one you never see the lanes and alleys flowing with foulness you never see such wretched little sties of houses you never see an inverted tin turnip on top of a church for a dome and as for a church bell why you never hear a church bell at all all this morning he had been finding fault straight along first it was with the mud he said it aint muddy in a protestant canton when it rains then it was with the dogs they dont have those lop eared dogs in a protestant canton then it was with the roads they dont leave the roads to make themselves in a protestant canton the people make them and they make a road that is a road too next it was the goats you never see a goat shedding tears in a protestant canton a goat there is one of the cheerfulest objects in nature next it was the chamois you never see a protestant chamois act like one of these they take a bite or two and go but these fellows camp with you and stay then it was the guide boards in a protestant canton you couldnt get lost if you wanted to but you never see a guide board in a catholic canton next you never see any flower boxes in the windows here never anything but now and then a cat a torpid one but you take a protestant canton windows perfectly lovely with flowers and as for cats theres just acres of them these folks in this canton leave a road to make itself and then fine you three francs if you trot over it as if a horse could trot over such a sarcasm of a road next about the goiter they talk about goiter i havent seen a goiter in this whole canton that i couldnt put in a hat he had growled at everything but i judged it would puzzle him to find anything the matter with this majestic glacier i intimated as much but he was ready and said with surly discontent you ought to see them in the protestant cantons this irritated me but i concealed the feeling and asked what is the matter with this one matter why it aint in any kind of condition they never take any care of a glacier here the moraine has been spilling gravel around it and got it all dirty why man they cant help that they you re right that is they wont they could if they wanted to you never see a speck of dirt on a protestant glacier look at the rhone glacier it is fifteen miles long and seven hundred feet thick if this was a protestant glacier you wouldnt see it looking like this i can tell you that is nonsense what would they do with it they would whitewash it they always do i did not believe a word of this but rather than have trouble i let it go for it is a waste of breath to argue with a bigot i even doubted if the rhone glacier was in a protestant canton but i did not know so i could not make anything by contradicting a man who would probably put me down at once with manufactured evidence about nine miles from st nicholas we crossed a bridge over the raging torrent of the visp and came to a log strip of flimsy fencing which was pretending to secure people from tumbling over a perpendicular wall forty feet high and into the river three children were approaching one of them a little girl about eight years old was running when pretty close to us she stumbled and fell and her feet shot under the rail of the fence and for a moment projected over the stream it gave us a sharp shock for we thought she was gone sure for the ground slanted steeply and to save herself seemed a sheer impossibility but she managed to scramble up and ran by us laughing we went forward and examined the place and saw the long tracks which her feet had made in the dirt when they darted over the verge if she had finished her trip she would have struck some big rocks in the edge of the water and then the torrent would have snatched her downstream among the half covered boulders and she would have been pounded to pulp in two minutes we had come exceedingly near witnessing her death and now harriss contrary nature and inborn selfishness were strikingly manifested he has no spirit of self denial he began straight off and continued for an hour to express his gratitude that the child was not destroyed i never saw such a man that was the kind of person he was just so he was gratified he never cared anything about anybody else i had noticed that trait in him over and over again often of course it was mere heedlessness mere want of reflection doubtless this may have been the case in most instances but it was not the less hard to bar on that account and after all its bottom its groundwork was selfishness there is no avoiding that conclusion in the instance under consideration i did think the indecency of running on in that way might occur to him but no the child was saved and he was glad that was sufficient he cared not a straw for my feelings or my loss of such a literary plum snatched from my very mouth at the instant it was ready to drop into it his selfishness was sufficient to place his own gratification in being spared suffering clear before all concern for me his friend apparently he did not once reflect upon the valuable details which would have fallen like a windfall to me fishing the child out witnessing the surprise of the family and the stir the thing would have made among the peasants then a swiss funeral then the roadside monument to be paid for by us and have our names mentioned in it and we should have gone into baedeker and been immortal i was silent i was too much hurt to complain if he could act so and be so heedless and so frivolous at such a time and actually seem to glory in it after all i had done for him i would have cut my hand off before i would let him see that i was wounded we were approaching zermatt consequently we were approaching the renowned matterhorn a month before this mountain had been only a name to us but latterly we had been moving through a steadily thickening double row of pictures of it done in oil water chromo wood steel copper crayon and photography and so it had at length become a shape to us and a very distinct decided and familiar one too we were expecting to recognize that mountain whenever or wherever we should run across it we were not deceived the monarch was far away when we first saw him but there was no such thing as mistaking him he has the rare peculiarity of standing by himself he is peculiarly steep too and is also most oddly shaped he towers into the sky like a colossal wedge with the upper third of its blade bent a little to the left the broad base of this monster wedge is planted upon a grand glacier paved alpine platform whose elevation is ten thousand feet above sea level as the wedge itself is some five thousand feet high it follows that its apex is about fifteen thousand feet above sea level so the whole bulk of this stately piece of rock this sky cleaving monolith is above the line of eternal snow yet while all its giant neighbors have the look of being built of solid snow from their waists up the matterhorn stands black and naked and forbidding the year round or merely powdered or streaked with white in places for its sides are so steep that the snow cannot stay there its strange form its august isolation and its majestic unkinship with its own kind make it so to speak the napoleon of the mountain world grand gloomy and peculiar is a phrase which fits it as aptly as it fitted the great captain think of a monument a mile high standing on a pedestal two miles high this is what the matterhorn is a monument its office henceforth for all time will be to keep watch and ward over the secret resting place of the young lord douglas who in was precipitated from the summit over a precipice four thousand feet high and never seen again no man ever had such a monument as this before the most imposing of the worlds other monuments are but atoms compared to it and they will perish and their places will pass from memory but this will remain the accident which cost lord douglas his life see chapter xii also cost the lives of three other men these three fell four fifths of a mile and their bodies were afterward found lying side by side upon a glacier whence they were borne to zermatt and buried in the churchyard the remains of lord douglas have never been found the secret of his sepulture like that of moses must remain a mystery always a walk from st nicholas to zermatt is a wonderful experience nature is built on a stupendous plan in that region one marches continually between walls that are piled into the skies with their upper heights broken into a confusion of sublime shapes that gleam white and cold against the background of blue and here and there one sees a big glacier displaying its grandeurs on the top of a precipice or a graceful cascade leaping and flashing down the green declivities there is nothing tame or cheap or trivial it is all magnificent that short valley is a picture gallery of a notable kind for it contains no mediocrities from end to end the creator has hung it with his masterpieces we made zermatt at three in the afternoon nine hours out from st nicholas distance by guide book twelve miles by pedometer seventy two we were in the heart and home of the mountain climbers now as all visible things testified the snow peaks did not hold themselves aloof in aristocratic reserve they nestled close around in a friendly sociable way guides with the ropes and axes and other implements of their fearful calling slung about their persons roosted in a long line upon a stone wall in front of the hotel and waited for customers sun burnt climbers in mountaineering costume and followed by their guides and porters arrived from time to time from breakneck expeditions among the peaks and glaciers of the high alps male and female tourists on mules filed by in a continuous procession hotelward bound from wild adventures which would grow in grandeur every time they were described at the english or american fireside and at last outgrow the possible itself we were not dreaming this was not a make believe home of the alp climber created by our heated imaginations no for here was mr girdlestone himself the famous englishman who hunts his way to the most formidable alpine summits without a guide i was not equal to imagining a girdlestone it was all i could do to even realize him while looking straight at him at short range i would rather face whole hyde parks of artillery than the ghastly forms of death which he has faced among the peaks and precipices of the mountains there is probably no pleasure equal to the pleasure of climbing a dangerous alp but it is a pleasure which is confined strictly to people who can find pleasure in it i have not jumped to this conclusion i have traveled to it per gravel train so to speak i have thought the thing all out and am quite sure i am right a born climbers appetite for climbing is hard to satisfy when it comes upon him he is like a starving man with a feast before him he may have other business on hand but it must wait mr girdlestone had had his usual summer holiday in the alps and had spent it in his usual way hunting for unique chances to break his neck his vacation was over and his luggage packed for england but all of a sudden a hunger had come upon him to climb the tremendous weisshorn once more for he had heard of a new and utterly impossible route up it his baggage was unpacked at once and now he and a friend laden with knapsacks ice axes coils of rope and canteens of milk were just setting out they would spend the night high up among the snows somewhere and get up at two in the morning and finish the enterprise i had a strong desire to go with them but forced it down a feat which mr girdlestone with all his fortitude could not do even ladies catch the climbing mania and are unable to throw it off a famous climber of that sex had attempted the weisshorn a few days before our arrival and she and her guides had lost their way in a snow storm high up among the peaks and glaciers and been forced to wander around a good while before they could find a way down when this lady reached the bottom she had been on her feet twenty three hours our guides hired on the gemmi were already at zermatt when we reached there so there was nothing to interfere with our getting up an adventure whenever we should choose the time and the object i resolved to devote my first evening in zermatt to studying up the subject of alpine climbing by way of preparation i read several books and here are some of the things i found out ones shoes must be strong and heavy and have pointed hobnails in them the alpenstock must be of the best wood for if it should break loss of life might be the result one should carry an ax to cut steps in the ice with on the great heights there must be a ladder for there are steep bits of rock which can be surmounted with this instrument or this utensil but could not be surmounted without it such an obstruction has compelled the tourist to waste hours hunting another route when a ladder would have saved him all trouble one must have from one hundred and fifty to five hundred feet of strong rope to be used in lowering the party down steep declivities which are too steep and smooth to be traversed in any other way one must have a steel hook on another rope a very useful thing for when one is ascending and comes to a low bluff which is yet too high for the ladder he swings this rope aloft like a lasso the hook catches at the top of the bluff and then the tourist climbs the rope hand over hand being always particular to try and forget that if the hook gives way he will never stop falling till he arrives in some part of switzerland where they are not expecting him another important thing there must be a rope to tie the whole party together with so that if one falls from a mountain or down a bottomless chasm in a glacier the others may brace back on the rope and save him one must have a silk veil to protect his face from snow sleet hail and gale and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous enemy snow blindness finally there must be some porters to carry provisions wine and scientific instruments and also blanket bags for the party to sleep in i closed my readings with a fearful adventure which mr whymper once had on the matterhorn when he was prowling around alone five thousand feet above the town of breil he was edging his way gingerly around the corner of a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of ice glazed snow joined it this declivity swept down a couple of hundred feet into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight hundred feet high overlooking a glacier his foot slipped and he fell he says my knapsack brought my head down first and i pitched into some rocks about a dozen feet below they caught something and tumbled me off the edge head over heels into the gully the baton was dashed from my hands and i whirled downward in a series of bounds each longer than the last now over ice now into rocks striking my head four or five times each time with increased force the last bound sent me spinning through the air in a leap of fifty or sixty feet from one side of the gully to the other and i struck the rocks luckily with the whole of my left side they caught my clothes for a moment and i fell back on to the snow with motion arrested my head fortunately came the right side up and a few frantic catches brought me to a halt in the neck of the gully and on the verge of the precipice baton hat and veil skimmed by and disappeared and the crash of the rocks which i had started as they fell on to the glacier told how narrow had been the escape from utter destruction as it was i fell nearly two hundred feet in seven or eight bounds ten feet more would have taken me in one gigantic leap of eight hundred feet on to the glacier below the situation was sufficiently serious the rocks could not be let go for a moment and the blood was spurting out of more than twenty cuts the most serious ones were in the head and i vainly tried to close them with one hand while holding on with the other it was useless the blood gushed out in blinding jets at each pulsation at last in a moment of inspiration i kicked out a big lump of snow and struck it as plaster on my head the idea was a happy one and the flow of blood diminished then scrambling up i got not a moment too soon to a place of safety and fainted away the sun was setting when consciousness returned and it was pitch dark before the great staircase was descended but by a combination of luck and care the whole four thousand seven hundred feet of descent to breil was accomplished without a slip or once missing the way his wounds kept him abed some days then he got up and climbed that mountain again that is the way with a true alp climber the more fun he has the more he wants chapter xxxvii our imposing column starts upward after i had finished my readings i was no longer myself i was tranced uplifted intoxicated by the almost incredible perils and adventures i had been following my authors through and the triumphs i had been sharing with them i sat silent some time then turned to harris and said my mind is made up something in my tone struck him and when he glanced at my eye and read what was written there his face paled perceptibly he hesitated a moment then said speak i answered with perfect calmness i will ascend the riffelberg if i had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from his chair more suddenly if i had been his father he could not have pleaded harder to get me to give up my purpose but i turned a deaf ear to all he said when he perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination he ceased to urge and for a while the deep silence was broken only by his sobs i sat in marble resolution with my eyes fixed upon vacancy for in spirit i was already wrestling with the perils of the mountains and my friend sat gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears at last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and exclaimed in broken tones your harris will never desert you we will die together i cheered the noble fellow with praises and soon his fears were forgotten and he was eager for the adventure he wanted to summon the guides at once and leave at two in the morning as he supposed the custom was but i explained that nobody was looking at that hour and that the start in the dark was not usually made from the village but from the first nights resting place on the mountain side i said we would leave the village at orp m on the morrow meantime he could notify the guides and also let the public know of the attempt which we proposed to make i went to bed but not to sleep no man can sleep when he is about to undertake one of these alpine exploits i tossed feverishly all night long and was glad enough when i heard the clock strike half past eleven and knew it was time to get up for dinner i rose jaded and rusty and went to the noon meal where i found myself the center of interest and curiosity for the news was already abroad it is not easy to eat calmly when you are a lion but it is very pleasant nevertheless as usual at zermatt when a great ascent is about to be undertaken everybody native and foreign laid aside his own projects and took up a good position to observe the start the expedition consisted of persons including the mules or including the cows as follows chiefs of service subordinates myself veterinary surgeon mr harris butler guides waiters surgeons footman geologist barber botanist head cook chaplains assistants draftsman pastry cooks barkeepers confectionery artist latinist transportation etc porters coarse washers and ironers mules fine ditto muleteers cows milkers total men animals grand total rations etc apparatus cases hams spring mattresses barrels flour hair ditto barrels whiskey bedding for same barrel sugar mosquito nets keg lemons tents cigars scientific instruments barrel pies ice axes ton of pemmican cases dynamite pair crutches cans nitroglycerin barrels arnica foot ladders bale of lint miles of rope kegs paregoric umbrellas it was full four o clock in the afternoon before my cavalcade was entirely ready at that hour it began to move in point of numbers and spectacular effect it was the most imposing expedition that had ever marched from zermatt i commanded the chief guide to arrange the men and animals in single file twelve feet apart and lash them all together on a strong rope he objected that the first two miles was a dead level with plenty of room and that the rope was never used except in very dangerous places but i would not listen to that my reading had taught me that many serious accidents had happened in the alps simply from not having the people tied up soon enough i was not going to add one to the list the guide then obeyed my order when the procession stood at ease roped together and ready to move i never saw a finer sight it was feet long over half a mile every man and me was on foot and had on his green veil and his blue goggles and his white rag around his hat and his coil of rope over one shoulder and under the other and his ice ax in his belt and carried his alpenstock in his left hand his umbrella closed in his right and his crutches slung at his back the burdens of the pack mules and the horns of the cows were decked with the edelweiss and the alpine rose i and my agent were the only persons mounted we were in the post of danger in the extreme rear and tied securely to five guides apiece our armor bearers carried our ice axes alpenstocks and other implements for us we were mounted upon very small donkeys as a measure of safety in time of peril we could straighten our legs and stand up and let the donkey walk from under still i cannot recommend this sort of animal at least for excursions of mere pleasure because his ears interrupt the view i and my agent possessed the regulation mountaineering costumes but concluded to leave them behind out of respect for the great numbers of tourists of both sexes who would be assembled in front of the hotels to see us pass and also out of respect for the many tourists whom we expected to encounter on our expedition we decided to make the ascent in evening dress we watered the caravan at the cold stream which rushes down a trough near the end of the village and soon afterward left the haunts of civilization behind us about half past five o clock we arrived at a bridge which spans the visp and after throwing over a detachment to see if it was safe the caravan crossed without accident the way now led by a gentle ascent carpeted with fresh green grass to the church at winkelmatten without stopping to examine this edifice i executed a flank movement to the right and crossed the bridge over the findelenbach after first testing its strength here i deployed to the right again and presently entered an inviting stretch of meadowland which was unoccupied save by a couple of deserted huts toward the furthest extremity these meadows offered an excellent camping place we pitched our tents supped established a proper grade recorded the events of the day and then went to bed we rose at two in the morning and dressed by candle light it was a dismal and chilly business a few stars were shining but the general heavens were overcast and the great shaft of the matterhorn was draped in a cable pall of clouds the chief guide advised a delay he said he feared it was going to rain we waited until nine o clock and then got away in tolerably clear weather our course led up some terrific steeps densely wooded with larches and cedars and traversed by paths which the rains had guttered and which were obstructed by loose stones to add to the danger and inconvenience we were constantly meeting returning tourists on foot and horseback and as constantly being crowded and battered by ascending tourists who were in a hurry and wanted to get by our troubles thickened about the middle of the afternoon the seventeen guides called a halt and held a consultation after consulting an hour they said their first suspicion remained intact that is to say they believed they were lost i asked if they did not know it no they said they couldnt absolutely know whether they were lost or not because none of them had ever been in that part of the country before they had a strong instinct that they were lost but they had no proofs except that they did not know where they were they had met no tourists for some time and they considered that a suspicious sign plainly we were in an ugly fix the guides were naturally unwilling to go alone and seek a way out of the difficulty so we all went together for better security we moved slow and cautiously for the forest was very dense we did not move up the mountain but around it hoping to strike across the old trail toward nightfall when we were about tired out we came up against a rock as big as a cottage this barrier took all the remaining spirit out of the men and a panic of fear and despair ensued they moaned and wept and said they should never see their homes and their dear ones again then they began to upbraid me for bringing them upon this fatal expedition some even muttered threats against me clearly it was no time to show weakness so i made a speech in which i said that other alp climbers had been in as perilous a position as this and yet by courage and perseverance had escaped i promised to stand by them i promised to rescue them i closed by saying we had plenty of provisions to maintain us for quite a siege and did they suppose zermatt would allow half a mile of men and mules to mysteriously disappear during any considerable time right above their noses and make no inquiries no zermatt would send out searching expeditions and we should be saved this speech had a great effect the men pitched the tents with some little show of cheerfulness and we were snugly under cover when the night shut down i now reaped the reward of my wisdom in providing one article which is not mentioned in any book of alpine adventure but this i refer to the paregoric but for that beneficent drug would have not one of those men slept a moment during that fearful night but for that gentle persuader they must have tossed unsoothed the night through for the whiskey was for me yes they would have risen in the morning unfitted for their heavy task as it was everybody slept but my agent and me only we and the barkeepers i would not permit myself to sleep at such a time i considered myself responsible for all those lives i meant to be on hand and ready in case of avalanches up there but i did not know it then we watched the weather all through that awful night and kept an eye on the barometer to be prepared for the least change there was not the slightest change recorded by the instrument during the whole time words cannot describe the comfort that that friendly hopeful steadfast thing was to me in that season of trouble it was a defective barometer and had no hand but the stationary brass pointer but i did not know that until afterward if i should be in such a situation again i should not wish for any barometer but that one all hands rose at two in the morning and took breakfast and as soon as it was light we roped ourselves together and went at that rock for some time we tried the hook rope and other means of scaling it but without success that is without perfect success the hook caught once and harris started up it hand over hand but the hold broke and if there had not happened to be a chaplain sitting underneath at the time harris would certainly have been crippled as it was it was the chaplain he took to his crutches and i ordered the hook rope to be laid aside it was too dangerous an implement where so many people are standing around we were puzzled for a while then somebody thought of the ladders one of these was leaned against the rock and the men went up it tied together in couples another ladder was sent up for use in descending at the end of half an hour everybody was over and that rock was conquered we gave our first grand shout of triumph but the joy was short lived for somebody asked how we were going to get the animals over this was a serious difficulty in fact it was an impossibility the courage of the men began to waver immediately once more we were threatened with a panic but when the danger was most imminent we were saved in a mysterious way a mule which had attracted attention from the beginning by its disposition to experiment tried to eat a five pound can of nitroglycerin this happened right alongside the rock the explosion threw us all to the ground and covered us with dirt and debris it frightened us extremely too for the crash it made was deafening and the violence of the shock made the ground tremble however we were grateful for the rock was gone its place was occupied by a new cellar about thirty feet across by fifteen feet deep the explosion was heard as far as zermatt and an hour and a half afterward many citizens of that town were knocked down and quite seriously injured by descending portions of mule meat frozen solid this shows better than any estimate in figures how high the experimenter went we had nothing to do now but bridge the cellar and proceed on our way with a cheer the men went at their work i attended to the engineering myself i appointed a strong detail to cut down trees with ice axes and trim them for piers to support the bridge this was a slow business for ice axes are not good to cut wood with i caused my piers to be firmly set up in ranks in the cellar and upon them i laid six of my forty foot ladders side by side and laid six more on top of them upon this bridge i caused a bed of boughs to be spread and on top of the boughs a bed of earth six inches deep i stretched ropes upon either side to serve as railings and then my bridge was complete a train of elephants could have crossed it in safety and comfort by nightfall the caravan was on the other side and the ladders were taken up next morning we went on in good spirits for a while though our way was slow and difficult by reason of the steep and rocky nature of the ground and the thickness of the forest but at last a dull despondency crept into the mens faces and it was apparent that not only they but even the guides were now convinced that we were lost the fact that we still met no tourists was a circumstance that was but too significant another thing seemed to suggest that we were not only lost but very badly lost for there must surely be searching parties on the road before this time yet we had seen no sign of them demoralization was spreading something must be done and done quickly too fortunately i am not unfertile in expedients i contrived one now which commended itself to all for it promised well i took three quarters of a mile of rope and fastened one end of it around the waist of a guide and told him to go find the road while the caravan waited i instructed him to guide himself back by the rope in case of failure in case of success he was to give the rope a series of violent jerks whereupon the expedition would go to him at once he departed and in two minutes had disappeared among the trees i payed out the rope myself while everybody watched the crawling thing with eager eyes the rope crept away quite slowly at times at other times with some briskness twice or thrice we seemed to get the signal and a shout was just ready to break from the mens lips when they perceived it was a false alarm but at last when over half a mile of rope had slidden away it stopped gliding and stood absolutely still one minute two minutes three while we held our breath and watched was the guide resting was he scanning the country from some high point was he inquiring of a chance mountaineer stop had he fainted from excess of fatigue and anxiety this thought gave us a shock i was in the very first act of detailing an expedition to succor him when the cord was assailed with a series of such frantic jerks that i could hardly keep hold of it the huzza that went up then was good to hear saved saved was the word that rang out all down the long rank of the caravan we rose up and started at once we found the route to be good enough for a while but it began to grow difficult by and by and this feature steadily increased when we judged we had gone half a mile we momently expected to see the guide but no he was not visible anywhere neither was he waiting for the rope was still moving consequently he was doing the same this argued that he had not found the road yet but was marching to it with some peasant there was nothing for us to do but plod along and this we did at the end of three hours we were still plodding this was not only mysterious but exasperating and very fatiguing too for we had tried hard along at first to catch up with the guide but had only fagged ourselves in vain for although he was traveling slowly he was yet able to go faster than the hampered caravan over such ground at three in the afternoon we were nearly dead with exhaustion and still the rope was slowly gliding out the murmurs against the guide had been growing steadily and at last they were become loud and savage a mutiny ensued the men refused to proceed they declared that we had been traveling over and over the same ground all day in a kind of circle they demanded that our end of the rope be made fast to a tree so as to halt the guide until we could overtake him and kill him this was not an unreasonable requirement so i gave the order as soon as the rope was tied the expedition moved forward with that alacrity which the thirst for vengeance usually inspires but after a tiresome march of almost half a mile we came to a hill covered thick with a crumbly rubbish of stones and so steep that no man of us all was now in a condition to climb it every attempt failed and ended in crippling somebody within twenty minutes i had five men on crutches whenever a climber tried to assist himself by the rope it yielded and let him tumble backward the frequency of this result suggested an idea to me i ordered the caravan to bout face and form in marching order i then made the tow rope fast to the rear mule and gave the command mark time by the right flank forward march the procession began to move to the impressive strains of a battle chant and i said to myself now if the rope dont break i judge this will fetch that guide into the camp i watched the rope gliding down the hill and presently when i was all fixed for triumph i was confronted by a bitter disappointment there was no guide tied to the rope it was only a very indignant old black ram the fury of the baffled expedition exceeded all bounds they even wanted to wreak their unreasoning vengeance on this innocent dumb brute but i stood between them and their prey menaced by a bristling wall of ice axes and alpenstocks and proclaimed that there was but one road to this murder and it was directly over my corpse even as i spoke i saw that my doom was sealed except a miracle supervened to divert these madmen from their fell purpose i see the sickening wall of weapons now i see that advancing host as i saw it then i see the hate in those cruel eyes i remember how i drooped my head upon my breast i feel again the sudden earthquake shock in my rear administered by the very ram i was sacrificing myself to save i hear once more the typhoon of laughter that burst from the assaulting column as i clove it from van to rear like a sepoy shot from a rodman gun i was saved yes i was saved and by the merciful instinct of ingratitude which nature had planted in the breast of that treacherous beast the grace which eloquence had failed to work in those mens hearts had been wrought by a laugh the ram was set free and my life was spared we lived to find out that that guide had deserted us as soon as he had placed a half mile between himself and us to avert suspicion he had judged it best that the line should continue to move so he caught that ram and at the time that he was sitting on it making the rope fast to it we were imagining that he was lying in a swoon overcome by fatigue and distress when he allowed the ram to get up it fell to plunging around trying to rid itself of the rope and this was the signal which we had risen up with glad shouts to obey we had followed this ram round and round in a circle all day a thing which was proven by the discovery that we had watered the expedition seven times at one and same spring in seven hours as expert a woodman as i am i had somehow failed to notice this until my attention was called to it by a hog this hog was always wallowing there and as he was the only hog we saw his frequent repetition together with his unvarying similarity to himself finally caused me to reflect that he must be the same hog and this led me to the deduction that this must be the same spring also which indeed it was i made a note of this curious thing as showing in a striking manner the relative difference between glacial action and the action of the hog it is now a well established fact that glaciers move i consider that my observations go to show with equal conclusiveness that a hog in a spring does not move i shall be glad to receive the opinions of other observers upon this point to return for an explanatory moment to that guide and then i shall be done with him after leaving the ram tied to the rope he had wandered at large a while and then happened to run across a cow judging that a cow would naturally know more than a guide he took her by the tail and the result justified his judgment she nibbled her leisurely way downhill till it was near milking time then she struck for home and towed him into zermatt chapter xxxviii i conquer the gorner grat we went into camp on that wild spot to which that ram had brought us the men were greatly fatigued their conviction that we were lost was forgotten in the cheer of a good supper and before the reaction had a chance to set in i loaded them up with paregoric and put them to bed next morning i was considering in my mind our desperate situation and trying to think of a remedy when harris came to me with a baedeker map which showed conclusively that the mountain we were on was still in switzerland yes every part of it was in switzerland so we were not lost after all this was an immense relief it lifted the weight of two such mountains from my breast i immediately had the news disseminated and the map was exhibited the effect was wonderful as soon as the men saw with their own eyes that they knew where they were and that it was only the summit that was lost and not themselves they cheered up instantly and said with one accord let the summit take care of itself our distresses being at an end i now determined to rest the men in camp and give the scientific department of the expedition a chance first i made a barometric observation to get our altitude but i could not perceive that there was any result i knew by my scientific reading that either thermometers or barometers ought to be boiled to make them accurate i did not know which it was so i boiled them both there was still no result so i examined these instruments and discovered that they possessed radical blemishes the barometer had no hand but the brass pointer and the ball of the thermometer was stuffed with tin foil i might have boiled those things to rags and never found out anything i hunted up another barometer it was new and perfect i boiled it half an hour in a pot of bean soup which the cooks were making the result was unexpected the instrument was not affecting at all but there was such a strong barometer taste to the soup that the head cook who was a most conscientious person changed its name in the bill of fare the dish was so greatly liked by all that i ordered the cook to have barometer soup every day it was believed that the barometer might eventually be injured but i did not care for that i had demonstrated to my satisfaction that it could not tell how high a mountain was therefore i had no real use for it changes in the weather i could take care of without it i did not wish to know when the weather was going to be good what i wanted to know was when it was going to be bad and this i could find out from harriss corns harris had had his corns tested and regulated at the government observatory in heidelberg and one could depend upon them with confidence so i transferred the new barometer to the cooking department to be used for the official mess it was found that even a pretty fair article of soup could be made from the defective barometer so i allowed that one to be transferred to the subordinate mess i next boiled the thermometer and got a most excellent result the mercury went up to about degrees fahrenheit in the opinion of the other scientists of the expedition this seemed to indicate that we had attained the extraordinary altitude of two hundred thousand feet above sea level science places the line of eternal snow at about ten thousand feet above sea level there was no snow where we were consequently it was proven that the eternal snow line ceases somewhere above the ten thousand foot level and does not begin any more this was an interesting fact and one which had not been observed by any observer before it was as valuable as interesting too since it would open up the deserted summits of the highest alps to population and agriculture it was a proud thing to be where we were yet it caused us a pang to reflect that but for that ram we might just as well have been two hundred thousand feet higher the success of my last experiment induced me to try an experiment with my photographic apparatus i got it out and boiled one of my cameras but the thing was a failure it made the wood swell up and burst and i could not see that the lenses were any better than they were before i now concluded to boil a guide it might improve him it could not impair his usefulness but i was not allowed to proceed guides have no feeling for science and this one would not consent to be made uncomfortable in its interest in the midst of my scientific work one of those needless accidents happened which are always occurring among the ignorant and thoughtless a porter shot at a chamois and missed it and crippled the latinist this was not a serious matter to me for a latinists duties are as well performed on crutches as otherwise but the fact remained that if the latinist had not happened to be in the way a mule would have got that load that would have been quite another matter for when it comes down to a question of value there is a palpable difference between a latinist and a mule i could not depend on having a latinist in the right place every time so to make things safe i ordered that in the future the chamois must not be hunted within limits of the camp with any other weapon than the forefinger my nerves had hardly grown quiet after this affair when they got another shake up one which utterly unmanned me for a moment a rumor swept suddenly through the camp that one of the barkeepers had fallen over a precipice however it turned out that it was only a chaplain i had laid in an extra force of chaplains purposely to be prepared for emergencies like this but by some unaccountable oversight had come away rather short handed in the matter of barkeepers on the following morning we moved on well refreshed and in good spirits i remember this day with peculiar pleasure because it saw our road restored to us yes we found our road again and in quite an extraordinary way we had plodded along some two hours and a half when we came up against a solid mass of rock about twenty feet high i did not need to be instructed by a mule this time i was already beginning to know more than any mule in the expedition i at once put in a blast of dynamite and lifted that rock out of the way but to my surprise and mortification i found that there had been a chalet on top of it i picked up such members of the family as fell in my vicinity and subordinates of my corps collected the rest none of these poor people were injured happily but they were much annoyed i explained to the head chaleteer just how the thing happened and that i was only searching for the road and would certainly have given him timely notice if i had known he was up there i said i had meant no harm and hoped i had not lowered myself in his estimation by raising him a few rods in the air i said many other judicious things and finally when i offered to rebuild his chalet and pay for the breakages and throw in the cellar he was mollified and satisfied he hadnt any cellar at all before he would not have as good a view now as formerly but what he had lost in view he had gained in cellar by exact measurement he said there wasnt another hole like that in the mountains and he would have been right if the late mule had not tried to eat up the nitroglycerin i put a hundred and sixteen men at work and they rebuilt the chalet from its own debris in fifteen minutes it was a good deal more picturesque than it was before too the man said we were now on the feil stutz above the schwegmatt information which i was glad to get since it gave us our position to a degree of particularity which we had not been accustomed to for a day or so we also learned that we were standing at the foot of the riffelberg proper and that the initial chapter of our work was completed we had a fine view from here of the energetic visp as it makes its first plunge into the world from under a huge arch of solid ice worn through the foot wall of the great gorner glacier and we could also see the furggenbach which is the outlet of the furggen glacier the mule road to the summit of the riffelberg passed right in front of the chalet a circumstance which we almost immediately noticed because a procession of tourists was filing along it pretty much all the time pretty much may not be elegant english but it is high time it was there is no elegant word or phrase which means just what it meansm t the chaleteers business consisted in furnishing refreshments to tourists my blast had interrupted this trade for a few minutes by breaking all the bottles on the place but i gave the man a lot of whiskey to sell for alpine champagne and a lot of vinegar which would answer for rhine wine consequently trade was soon as brisk as ever leaving the expedition outside to rest i quartered myself in the chalet with harris proposing to correct my journals and scientific observations before continuing the ascent i had hardly begun my work when a tall slender vigorous american youth of about twenty three who was on his way down the mountain entered and came toward me with that breezy self complacency which is the adolescents idea of the well bred ease of the man of the world his hair was short and parted accurately in the middle and he had all the look of an american person who would be likely to begin his signature with an initial and spell his middle name out he introduced himself smiling a smirky smile borrowed from the courtiers of the stage extended a fair skinned talon and while he gripped my hand in it he bent his body forward three times at the hips as the stage courtier does and said in the airiest and most condescending and patronizing way i quite remember his exact language very glad to make your acquaintancem sure very glad indeed assure you i ve read all your little efforts and greatly admired them and when i heard you were here i i indicated a chair and he sat down this grandee was the grandson of an american of considerable note in his day and not wholly forgotten yet a man who came so near being a great man that he was quite generally accounted one while he lived i slowly paced the floor pondering scientific problems and heard this conversation grandson first visit to europe harris mine yes g s with a soft reminiscent sigh suggestive of bygone joys that may be tasted in their freshness but once ah i know what it is to you a first visit ah the romance of it i wish i could feel it again h yes i find it exceeds all my dreams it is enchantment i go g s with a dainty gesture of the hand signifying spare me your callow enthusiasms good friend yes i know i know you go to cathedrals and exclaim and you drag through league long picture galleries and exclaim and you stand here and there and yonder upon historic ground and continue to exclaim and you are permeated with your first crude conceptions of art and are proud and happy ah yes proud and happy that expresses it yes yes enjoy it it is right it is an innocent revel h and you dont you do these things now g s i oh that is very good my dear sir when you are as old a traveler as i am you will not ask such a question as that i visit the regulation gallery moon around the regulation cathedral do the worn round of the regulation sights yet excuse me h well what do you do then g s do i flit and flit for i am ever on the wing but i avoid the herd today i am in paris tomorrow in berlin anon in rome but you would look for me in vain in the galleries of the louvre or the common resorts of the gazers in those other capitals if you would find me you must look in the unvisited nooks and corners where others never think of going one day you will find me making myself at home in some obscure peasants cabin another day you will find me in some forgotten castle worshiping some little gem or art which the careless eye has overlooked and which the unexperienced would despise again you will find me as guest in the inner sanctuaries of palaces while the herd is content to get a hurried glimpse of the unused chambers by feeing a servant h you are a guest in such places g s and a welcoming one h it is surprising how does it come g s my grandfathers name is a passport to all the courts in europe i have only to utter that name and every door is open to me i flit from court to court at my own free will and pleasure and am always welcome i am as much at home in the palaces of europe as you are among your relatives i know every titled person in europe i think i have my pockets full of invitations all the time i am under promise to go to italy where i am to be the guest of a succession of the noblest houses in the land in berlin my life is a continued round of gaiety in the imperial palace it is the same wherever i go h it must be very pleasant but it must make boston seem a little slow when you are at home g s yes of course it does but i dont go home much theres no life there little to feed a mans higher nature bostons very narrow you know she doesnt know it and you couldnt convince her of it so i say nothing when im there wheres the use yes boston is very narrow but she has such a good opinion of herself that she cant see it a man who has traveled as much as i have and seen as much of the world sees it plain enough but he cant cure it you know so the best is to leave it and seek a sphere which is more in harmony with his tastes and culture i run across there once a year perhaps when i have nothing important on hand but im very soon back again i spend my time in europe h i see you map out your plans and g s no excuse me i dont map out any plans i simply follow the inclination of the day i am limited by no ties no requirements i am not bound in any way i am too old a traveler to hamper myself with deliberate purposes i am simply a traveler an inveterate traveler a man of the world in a word i can call myself by no other name i do not say i am going here or i am going there i say nothing at all i only act for instance next week you may find me the guest of a grandee of spain or you may find me off for venice or flitting toward dresden i shall probably go to egypt presently friends will say to friends he is at the nile cataracts and at that very moment they will be surprised to learn that im away off yonder in india somewhere i am a constant surprise to people they are always saying yes he was in jerusalem when we heard of him last but goodness knows where he is now presently the grandson rose to leave discovered he had an appointment with some emperor perhaps he did his graces over again gripped me with one talon at arms length pressed his hat against his stomach with the other bent his body in the middle three times murmuring pleasurem sure great pleasurem sure wish you much success then he removed his gracious presence it is a great and solemn thing to have a grandfather i have not purposed to misrepresent this boy in any way for what little indignation he excited in me soon passed and left nothing behind it but compassion one cannot keep up a grudge against a vacuum i have tried to repeat this lads very words if i have failed anywhere i have at least not failed to reproduce the marrow and meaning of what he said he and the innocent chatterbox whom i met on the swiss lake are the most unique and interesting specimens of young america i came across during my foreign tramping i have made honest portraits of them not caricatures the grandson of twenty three referred to himself five or six times as an old traveler and as many as three times with a serene complacency which was maddening as a man of the world there was something very delicious about his leaving boston to her narrowness unreproved and uninstructed i formed the caravan in marching order presently and after riding down the line to see that it was properly roped together gave the command to proceed in a little while the road carried us to open grassy land we were above the troublesome forest now and had an uninterrupted view straight before us of our summit the summit of the riffelberg we followed the mule road a zigzag course now to the right now to the left but always up and always crowded and incommoded by going and coming files of reckless tourists who were never in a single instance tied together i was obliged to exert the utmost care and caution for in many places the road was not two yards wide and often the lower side of it sloped away in slanting precipices eight and even nine feet deep i had to encourage the men constantly to keep them from giving way to their unmanly fears we might have made the summit before night but for a delay caused by the loss of an umbrella i was allowing the umbrella to remain lost but the men murmured and with reason for in this exposed region we stood in peculiar need of protection against avalanches so i went into camp and detached a strong party to go after the missing article the difficulties of the next morning were severe but our courage was high for our goal was near at noon we conquered the last impediment we stood at last upon the summit and without the loss of a single man except the mule that ate the glycerin our great achievement was achieved the possibility of the impossible was demonstrated and harris and i walked proudly into the great dining room of the riffelberg hotel and stood our alpenstocks up in the corner yes i had made the grand ascent but it was a mistake to do it in evening dress the plug hats were battered the swallow tails were fluttering rags mud added no grace the general effect was unpleasant and even disreputable there were about seventy five tourists at the hotel mainly ladies and little children and they gave us an admiring welcome which paid us for all our privations and sufferings the ascent had been made and the names and dates now stand recorded on a stone monument there to prove it to all future tourists i boiled a thermometer and took an altitude with a most curious result the summit was not as high as the point on the mountainside where i had taken the first altitude suspecting that i had made an important discovery i prepared to verify it there happened to be a still higher summit called the gorner grat above the hotel and notwithstanding the fact that it overlooks a glacier from a dizzy height and that the ascent is difficult and dangerous i resolved to venture up there and boil a thermometer so i sent a strong party with some borrowed hoes in charge of two chiefs of service to dig a stairway in the soil all the way up and this i ascended roped to the guides this breezy height was the summit proper so i accomplished even more than i had originally purposed to do this foolhardy exploit is recorded on another stone monument i boiled my thermometer and sure enough this spot which purported to be two thousand feet higher than the locality of the hotel turned out to be nine thousand feet lower thus the fact was clearly demonstrated that above a certain point the higher a point seems to be the lower it actually is our ascent itself was a great achievement but this contribution to science was an inconceivably greater matter cavilers object that water boils at a lower and lower temperature the higher and higher you go and hence the apparent anomaly i answer that i do not base my theory upon what the boiling water does but upon what a boiled thermometer says you cant go behind the thermometer i had a magnificent view of monte rosa and apparently all the rest of the alpine world from that high place all the circling horizon was piled high with a mighty tumult of snowy crests one might have imagined he saw before him the tented camps of a beleaguering host of brobdingnagians note i had the very unusual luck to catch one little momentary glimpse of the matterhorn wholly unencumbered by clouds i leveled my photographic apparatus at it without the loss of an instant and should have got an elegant picture if my donkey had not interfered it was my purpose to draw this photograph all by myself for my book but was obliged to put the mountain part of it into the hands of the professional artist because i found i could not do landscape well but lonely conspicuous and superb rose that wonderful upright wedge the matterhorn its precipitous sides were powdered over with snow and the upper half hidden in thick clouds which now and then dissolved to cobweb films and gave brief glimpses of the imposing tower as through a veil a little later the matterhorn took to himself the semblance of a volcano he was stripped naked to his apex around this circled vast wreaths of white cloud which strung slowly out and streamed away slantwise toward the sun a twenty mile stretch of rolling and tumbling vapor and looking just as if it were pouring out of a crater later again one of the mountains sides was clean and clear and another side densely clothed from base to summit in thick smokelike cloud which feathered off and flew around the shafts sharp edge like the smoke around the corners of a burning building the matterhorn is always experimenting and always gets up fine effects too in the sunset when all the lower world is palled in gloom it points toward heaven out of the pervading blackness like a finger of fire in the sunrise well they say it is very fine in the sunrise authorities agree that there is no such tremendous layout of snowy alpine magnitude grandeur and sublimity to be seen from any other accessible point as the tourist may see from the summit of the riffelberg therefore let the tourist rope himself up and go there for i have shown that with nerve caution and judgment the thing can be done i wish to add one remark here in parentheses so to speak suggested by the word snowy which i have just used we have all seen hills and mountains and levels with snow on them and so we think we know all the aspects and effects produced by snow but indeed we do not until we have seen the alps possibly mass and distance add something at any rate something is added among other noticeable things there is a dazzling intense whiteness about the distant alpine snow when the sun is on it which one recognizes as peculiar and not familiar to the eye the snow which one is accustomed to has a tint to it painters usually give it a bluish cast but there is no perceptible tint to the distant alpine snow when it is trying to look its whitest as to the unimaginable splendor of it when the sun is blazing down on it well it simply is unimaginable chapter xxxix we travel by glacier a guide book is a queer thing the reader has just seen what a man who undertakes the great ascent from zermatt to the riffelberg hotel must experience yet baedeker makes these strange statements concerning this matter distance hours the road cannot be mistaken guide unnecessary distance from riffelberg hotel to the gorner grat one hour and a half ascent simple and easy guide unnecessary elevation of zermatt above sea level feet elevation of riffelberg hotel above sea level feet elevation of the gorner grat above sea level feet i have pretty effectually throttled these errors by sending him the following demonstrated facts distance from zermatt to riffelberg hotel days the road can be mistaken if i am the first that did it i want the credit of it too guides are necessary for none but a native can read those finger boards the estimate of the elevation of the several localities above sea level is pretty correct for baedeker he only misses it about a hundred and eighty or ninety thousand feet i found my arnica invaluable my men were suffering excruciatingly from the friction of sitting down so much during two or three days not one of them was able to do more than lie down or walk about yet so effective was the arnica that on the fourth all were able to sit up i consider that more than to anything else i owe the success of our great undertaking to arnica and paregoric my men are being restored to health and strength my main perplexity now was how to get them down the mountain again i was not willing to expose the brave fellows to the perils fatigues and hardships of that fearful route again if it could be helped first i thought of balloons but of course i had to give that idea up for balloons were not procurable i thought of several other expedients but upon consideration discarded them for cause but at last i hit it i was aware that the movement of glaciers is an established fact for i had read it in baedeker so i resolved to take passage for zermatt on the great gorner glacier very good the next thing was how to get down the glacier comfortably for the mule road to it was long and winding and wearisome i set my mind at work and soon thought out a plan one looks straight down upon the vast frozen river called the gorner glacier from the gorner grat a sheer precipice twelve hundred feet high we had one hundred and fifty four umbrellas and what is an umbrella but a parachute i mentioned this noble idea to harris with enthusiasm and was about to order the expedition to form on the gorner grat with their umbrellas and prepare for flight by platoons each platoon in command of a guide when harris stopped me and urged me not to be too hasty he asked me if this method of descending the alps had ever been tried before i said no i had not heard of an instance then in his opinion it was a matter of considerable gravity in his opinion it would not be well to send the whole command over the cliff at once a better way would be to send down a single individual first and see how he fared i saw the wisdom in this idea instantly i said as much and thanked my agent cordially and told him to take his umbrella and try the thing right away and wave his hat when he got down if he struck in a soft place and then i would ship the rest right along harris was greatly touched with this mark of confidence and said so in a voice that had a perceptible tremble in it but at the same time he said he did not feel himself worthy of so conspicuous a favor that it might cause jealousy in the command for there were plenty who would not hesitate to say he had used underhanded means to get the appointment whereas his conscience would bear him witness that he had not sought it at all nor even in his secret heart desired it i said these words did him extreme credit but that he must not throw away the imperishable distinction of being the first man to descend an alp per parachute simply to save the feelings of some envious underlings no i said he must accept the appointment it was no longer an invitation it was a command he thanked me with effusion and said that putting the thing in this form removed every objection he retired and soon returned with his umbrella his eye flaming with gratitude and his cheeks pallid with joy just then the head guide passed along harriss expression changed to one of infinite tenderness and he said that man did me a cruel injury four days ago and i said in my heart he should live to perceive and confess that the only noble revenge a man can take upon his enemy is to return good for evil i resign in his favor appoint him i threw my arms around the generous fellow and said harris you are the noblest soul that lives you shall not regret this sublime act neither shall the world fail to know of it you shall have opportunity far transcending this one too if i live remember that i called the head guide to me and appointed him on the spot but the thing aroused no enthusiasm in him he did not take to the idea at all he said tie myself to an umbrella and jump over the gorner grat excuse me there are a great many pleasanter roads to the devil than that upon a discussion of the subject with him it appeared that he considered the project distinctly and decidedly dangerous i was not convinced yet i was not willing to try the experiment in any risky way that is in a way that might cripple the strength and efficiency of the expedition i was about at my wits end when it occurred to me to try it on the latinist he was called in but he declined on the plea of inexperience diffidence in public lack of curiosity and i didnt know what all another man declined on account of a cold in the head thought he ought to avoid exposure another could not jump well never could jump well did not believe he could jump so far without long and patient practice another was afraid it was going to rain and his umbrella had a hole in it everybody had an excuse the result was what the reader has by this time guessed the most magnificent idea that was ever conceived had to be abandoned from sheer lack of a person with enterprise enough to carry it out yes i actually had to give that thing up while doubtless i should live to see somebody use it and take all the credit from me well i had to go overland there was no other way i marched the expedition down the steep and tedious mule path and took up as good a position as i could upon the middle of the glacier because baedeker said the middle part travels the fastest as a measure of economy however i put some of the heavier baggage on the shoreward parts to go as slow freight i waited and waited but the glacier did not move night was coming on the darkness began to gather still we did not budge it occurred to me then that there might be a time table in baedeker it would be well to find out the hours of starting i called for the book it could not be found bradshaw would certainly contain a time table but no bradshaw could be found very well i must make the best of the situation so i pitched the tents picketed the animals milked the cows had supper paregoricked the men established the watch and went to bed with orders to call me as soon as we came in sight of zermatt i awoke about half past ten next morning and looked around we hadnt budged a peg at first i could not understand it then it occurred to me that the old thing must be aground so i cut down some trees and rigged a spar on the starboard and another on the port side and fooled away upward of three hours trying to spar her off but it was no use she was half a mile wide and fifteen or twenty miles long and there was no telling just whereabouts she was aground the men began to show uneasiness too and presently they came flying to me with ashy faces saying she had sprung a leak nothing but my cool behavior at this critical time saved us from another panic i ordered them to show me the place they led me to a spot where a huge boulder lay in a deep pool of clear and brilliant water it did look like a pretty bad leak but i kept that to myself i made a pump and set the men to work to pump out the glacier we made a success of it i perceived then that it was not a leak at all this boulder had descended from a precipice and stopped on the ice in the middle of the glacier and the sun had warmed it up every day and consequently it had melted its way deeper and deeper into the ice until at last it reposed as we had found it in a deep pool of the clearest and coldest water presently baedeker was found again and i hunted eagerly for the time table there was none the book simply said the glacier was moving all the time this was satisfactory so i shut up the book and chose a good position to view the scenery as we passed along i stood there some time enjoying the trip but at last it occurred to me that we did not seem to be gaining any on the scenery i said to myself this confounded old things aground again sure and opened baedeker to see if i could run across any remedy for these annoying interruptions i soon found a sentence which threw a dazzling light upon the matter it said the gorner glacier travels at an average rate of a little less than an inch a day i have seldom felt so outraged i have seldom had my confidence so wantonly betrayed i made a small calculation one inch a day say thirty feet a year estimated distance to zermatt three and one eighteenth miles time required to go by glacier a little over five hundred years i said to myself i can walk it quicker and before i will patronize such a fraud as this i will do it when i revealed to harris the fact that the passenger part of this glacier the central part the lightning express part so to speak was not due in zermatt till the summer of and that the baggage coming along the slow edge would not arrive until some generations later he burst out with that is european management all over an inch a day think of that five hundred years to go a trifle over three miles but i am not a bit surprised its a catholic glacier you can tell by the look of it and the management i said no i believed nothing but the extreme end of it was in a catholic canton well then its a government glacier said harris its all the same over here the government runs everything so everythings slow slow and ill managed but with us everythings done by private enterprise and then there aint much lolling around you can depend on it i wish tom scott could get his hands on this torpid old slab once youd see it take a different gait from this i said i was sure he would increase the speed if there was trade enough to justify it hed make trade said harris thats the difference between governments and individuals governments dont care individuals do tom scott would take all the trade in two years gorner stock would go to two hundred and inside of two more you would see all the other glaciers under the hammer for taxes after a reflective pause harris added a little less than an inch a day a little less than an inch mind you well im losing my reverence for glaciers i was feeling much the same way myself i have traveled by canal boat ox wagon raft and by the ephesus and smyrna railway but when it comes down to good solid honest slow motion i bet my money on the glacier as a means of passenger transportation i consider the glacier a failure but as a vehicle of slow freight i think she fills the bill in the matter of putting the fine shades on that line of business i judge she could teach the germans something i ordered the men to break camp and prepare for the land journey to zermatt at this moment a most interesting find was made a dark object bedded in the glacial ice was cut out with the ice axes and it proved to be a piece of the undressed skin of some animal a hair trunk perhaps but a close inspection disabled the hair trunk theory and further discussion and examination exploded it entirely that is in the opinion of all the scientists except the one who had advanced it this one clung to his theory with affectionate fidelity characteristic of originators of scientific theories and afterward won many of the first scientists of the age to his view by a very able pamphlet which he wrote entitled evidences going to show that the hair trunk in a wild state belonged to the early glacial period and roamed the wastes of chaos in the company with the cave bear primeval man and the other ooelitics of the old silurian family each of our scientists had a theory of his own and put forward an animal of his own as a candidate for the skin i sided with the geologist of the expedition in the belief that this patch of skin had once helped to cover a siberian elephant in some old forgotten age but we divided there the geologist believing that this discovery proved that siberia had formerly been located where switzerland is now whereas i held the opinion that it merely proved that the primeval swiss was not the dull savage he is represented to have been but was a being of high intellectual development who liked to go to the menagerie we arrived that evening after many hardships and adventures in some fields close to the great ice arch where the mad visp boils and surges out from under the foot of the great gorner glacier and here we camped our perils over and our magnificent undertaking successfully completed we marched into zermatt the next day and were received with the most lavish honors and applause a document signed and sealed by the authorities was given to me which established and endorsed the fact that i had made the ascent of the riffelberg this i wear around my neck and it will be buried with me when i am no more chapter xl piteous relics at chamonix i am not so ignorant about glacial movement now as i was when i took passage on the gorner glacier i have read up since i am aware that these vast bodies of ice do not travel at the same rate of speed while the gorner glacier makes less than an inch a day the unter aar glacier makes as much as eight and still other glaciers are said to go twelve sixteen and even twenty inches a day one writer says that the slowest glacier travels twenty five feet a year and the fastest four hundred what is a glacier it is easy to say it looks like a frozen river which occupies the bed of a winding gorge or gully between mountains but that gives no notion of its vastness for it is sometimes six hundred feet thick and we are not accustomed to rivers six hundred feet deep no our rivers are six feet twenty feet and sometimes fifty feet deep we are not quite able to grasp so large a fact as an ice river six hundred feet deep the glaciers surface is not smooth and level but has deep swales and swelling elevations and sometimes has the look of a tossing sea whose turbulent billows were frozen hard in the instant of their most violent motion the glaciers surface is not a flawless mass but is a river with cracks or crevices some narrow some gaping wide many a man the victim of a slip or a misstep has plunged down one of these and met his death men have been fished out of them alive but it was when they did not go to a great depth the cold of the great depths would quickly stupefy a man whether he was hurt or unhurt these cracks do not go straight down one can seldom see more than twenty to forty feet down them consequently men who have disappeared in them have been sought for in the hope that they had stopped within helping distance whereas their case in most instances had really been hopeless from the beginning in a party of tourists was descending mont blanc and while picking their way over one of the mighty glaciers of that lofty region roped together as was proper a young porter disengaged himself from the line and started across an ice bridge which spanned a crevice it broke under him with a crash and he disappeared the others could not see how deep he had gone so it might be worthwhile to try and rescue him a brave young guide named michel payot volunteered two ropes were made fast to his leather belt and he bore the end of a third one in his hand to tie to the victim in case he found him he was lowered into the crevice he descended deeper and deeper between the clear blue walls of solid ice he approached a bend in the crack and disappeared under it down and still down he went into this profound grave when he had reached a depth of eighty feet he passed under another bend in the crack and thence descended eighty feet lower as between perpendicular precipices arrived at this stage of one hundred and sixty feet below the surface of the glacier he peered through the twilight dimness and perceived that the chasm took another turn and stretched away at a steep slant to unknown deeps for its course was lost in darkness what a place that was to be in especially if that leather belt should break the compression of the belt threatened to suffocate the intrepid fellow he called to his friends to draw him up but could not make them hear they still lowered him deeper and deeper then he jerked his third cord as vigorously as he could his friends understood and dragged him out of those icy jaws of death then they attached a bottle to a cord and sent it down two hundred feet but it found no bottom it came up covered with congelations evidence enough that even if the poor porter reached the bottom with unbroken bones a swift death from cold was sure anyway a glacier is a stupendous ever progressing resistless plow it pushes ahead of it masses of boulders which are packed together and they stretch across the gorge right in front of it like a long grave or a long sharp roof this is called a moraine it also shoves out a moraine along each side of its course imposing as the modern glaciers are they are not so huge as were some that once existed for instance mr whymper says at some very remote period the valley of aosta was occupied by a vast glacier which flowed down its entire length from mont blanc to the plain of piedmont remained stationary or nearly so at its mouth for many centuries and deposited there enormous masses of debris the length of this glacier exceeded eighty miles and it drained a basin twenty five to thirty five miles across bounded by the highest mountains in the alps the great peaks rose several thousand feet above the glaciers and then as now shattered by sun and frost poured down their showers of rocks and stones in witness of which there are the immense piles of angular fragments that constitute the moraines of ivrea the moraines around ivrea are of extraordinary dimensions that which was on the left bank of the glacier is about thirteen miles long and in some places rises to a height of two thousand one hundred and thirty feet above the floor of the valley the terminal moraines those which are pushed in front of the glaciers cover something like twenty square miles of country at the mouth of the valley of aosta the thickness of the glacier must have been at least two thousand feet and its width at that part five miles and a quarter it is not easy to get at a comprehension of a mass of ice like that if one could cleave off the butt end of such a glacier an oblong block two or three miles wide by five and a quarter long and two thousand feet thick he could completely hide the city of new york under it and trinity steeple would only stick up into it relatively as far as a shingle nail would stick up into the bottom of a saratoga trunk the boulders from mont blanc upon the plain below ivrea assure us that the glacier which transported them existed for a prodigious length of time their present distance from the cliffs from which they were derived is about feet and if we assume that they traveled at the rate of feet per annum their journey must have occupied them no less than years in all probability they did not travel so fast glaciers are sometimes hurried out of their characteristic snail pace a marvelous spectacle is presented then mr whymper refers to a case which occurred in iceland in it seems that in the neighborhood of the mountain kotlugja large bodies of water formed underneath or within the glaciers either on account of the interior heat of the earth or from other causes and at length acquired irresistible power tore the glaciers from their mooring on the land and swept them over every obstacle into the sea prodigious masses of ice were thus borne for a distance of about ten miles over land in the space of a few hours and their bulk was so enormous that they covered the sea for seven miles from the shore and remained aground in six hundred feet of water the denudation of the land was upon a grand scale all superficial accumulations were swept away and the bedrock was exposed it was described in graphic language how all irregularities and depressions were obliterated and a smooth surface of several miles area laid bare and that this area had the appearance of having been planed by a plane the account translated from the icelandic says that the mountainlike ruins of this majestic glacier so covered the sea that as far as the eye could reach no open water was discoverable even from the highest peaks a monster wall or barrier of ice was built across a considerable stretch of land too by this strange irruption one can form some idea of the altitude of this barrier of ice when it is mentioned that from hofdabrekka farm which lies high up on a fjeld one could not see hjorleifshofdi opposite which is a fell six hundred and forty feet in height but in order to do so had to clamber up a mountain slope east of hofdabrekka twelve hundred feet high these things will help the reader to understand why it is that a man who keeps company with glaciers comes to feel tolerably insignificant by and by the alps and the glaciers together are able to take every bit of conceit out of a man and reduce his self importance to zero if he will only remain within the influence of their sublime presence long enough to give it a fair and reasonable chance to do its work the alpine glaciers move that is granted now by everybody but there was a time when people scoffed at the idea they said you might as well expect leagues of solid rock to crawl along the ground as expect leagues of ice to do it but proof after proof was furnished and the finally the world had to believe the wise men not only said the glacier moved but they timed its movement they ciphered out a glaciers gait and then said confidently that it would travel just so far in so many years there is record of a striking and curious example of the accuracy which may be attained in these reckonings in the ascent of mont blanc was attempted by a russian and two englishmen with seven guides they had reached a prodigious altitude and were approaching the summit when an avalanche swept several of the party down a sharp slope of two hundred feet and hurled five of them all guides into one of the crevices of a glacier the life of one of the five was saved by a long barometer which was strapped to his back it bridged the crevice and suspended him until help came the alpenstock or baton of another saved its owner in a similar way three men were lost pierre balmat pierre carrier and auguste tairraz they had been hurled down into the fathomless great deeps of the crevice dr forbes the english geologist had made frequent visits to the mont blanc region and had given much attention to the disputed question of the movement of glaciers during one of these visits he completed his estimates of the rate of movement of the glacier which had swallowed up the three guides and uttered the prediction that the glacier would deliver up its dead at the foot of the mountain thirty five years from the time of the accident or possibly forty a dull slow journey a movement imperceptible to any eye but it was proceeding nevertheless and without cessation it was a journey which a rolling stone would make in a few seconds the lofty point of departure was visible from the village below in the valley the prediction cut curiously close to the truth forty one years after the catastrophe the remains were cast forth at the foot of the glacier i find an interesting account of the matter in the histoire du mont blanc by stephen d arve i will condense this account as follows on the th of august at the hour of the close of mass a guide arrived out of breath at the mairie of chamonix and bearing on his shoulders a very lugubrious burden it was a sack filled with human remains which he had gathered from the orifice of a crevice in the glacier des bossons he conjectured that these were remains of the victims of the catastrophe of and a minute inquest immediately instituted by the local authorities soon demonstrated the correctness of his supposition the contents of the sack were spread upon a long table and officially inventoried as follows portions of three human skulls several tufts of black and blonde hair a human jaw furnished with fine white teeth a forearm and hand all the fingers of the latter intact the flesh was white and fresh and both the arm and hand preserved a degree of flexibility in the articulations the ring finger had suffered a slight abrasion and the stain of the blood was still visible and unchanged after forty one years a left foot the flesh white and fresh along with these fragments were portions of waistcoats hats hobnailed shoes and other clothing a wing of a pigeon with black feathers a fragment of an alpenstock a tin lantern and lastly a boiled leg of mutton the only flesh among all the remains that exhaled an unpleasant odor the guide said that the mutton had no odor when he took it from the glacier an hours exposure to the sun had already begun the work of decomposition upon it persons were called for to identify these poor pathetic relics and a touching scene ensued two men were still living who had witnessed the grim catastrophe of nearly half a century before marie couttet saved by his baton and julien davouassoux saved by the barometer these aged men entered and approached the table davouassoux more than eighty years old contemplated the mournful remains mutely and with a vacant eye for his intelligence and his memory were torpid with age but couttets faculties were still perfect at seventy two and he exhibited strong emotion he said pierre balmat was fair he wore a straw hat this bit of skull with the tuft of blond hair was his this is his hat pierre carrier was very dark this skull was his and this felt hat this is balmats hand i remember it so well and the old man bent down and kissed it reverently then closed his fingers upon it in an affectionate grasp crying out i could never have dared to believe that before quitting this world it would be granted me to press once more the hand of one of those brave comrades the hand of my good friend balmat there is something weirdly pathetic about the picture of that white haired veteran greeting with his loving handshake this friend who had been dead forty years when these hands had met last they were alike in the softness and freshness of youth now one was brown and wrinkled and horny with age while the other was still as young and fair and blemishless as if those forty years had come and gone in a single moment leaving no mark of their passage time had gone on in the one case it had stood still in the other a man who has not seen a friend for a generation keeps him in mind always as he saw him last and is somehow surprised and is also shocked to see the aging change the years have wrought when he sees him again marie couttets experience in finding his friends hand unaltered from the image of it which he had carried in his memory for forty years is an experience which stands alone in the history of man perhaps couttet identified other relics this hat belonged to auguste tairraz he carried the cage of pigeons which we proposed to set free upon the summit here is the wing of one of those pigeons and here is the fragment of my broken baton it was by grace of that baton that my life was saved who could have told me that i should one day have the satisfaction to look again upon this bit of wood that supported me above the grave that swallowed up my unfortunate companions no portions of the body of tairraz other than a piece of the skull had been found a diligent search was made but without result however another search was instituted a year later and this had better success many fragments of clothing which had belonged to the lost guides were discovered also part of a lantern and a green veil with blood stains on it but the interesting feature was this one of the searchers came suddenly upon a sleeved arm projecting from a crevice in the ice wall with the hand outstretched as if offering greeting the nails of this white hand were still rosy and the pose of the extended fingers seemed to express an eloquent welcome to the long lost light of day the hand and arm were alone there was no trunk after being removed from the ice the flesh tints quickly faded out and the rosy nails took on the alabaster hue of death this was the third right hand found therefore all three of the lost men were accounted for beyond cavil or question dr hamel was the russian gentleman of the party which made the ascent at the time of the famous disaster he left chamonix as soon as he conveniently could after the descent and as he had shown a chilly indifference about the calamity and offered neither sympathy nor assistance to the widows and orphans he carried with him the cordial execrations of the whole community four months before the first remains were found a chamonix guide named balmat a relative of one of the lost men was in london and one day encountered a hale old gentleman in the british museum who said i overheard your name are you from chamonix monsieur balmat yes sir havent they found the bodies of my three guides yet i am dr hamel alas no monsieur well you ll find them sooner or later yes it is the opinion of dr forbes and mr tyndall that the glacier will sooner or later restore to us the remains of the unfortunate victims without a doubt without a doubt and it will be a great thing for chamonix in the matter of attracting tourists you can get up a museum with those remains that will draw this savage idea has not improved the odor of dr hamels name in chamonix by any means but after all the man was sound on human nature his idea was conveyed to the public officials of chamonix and they gravely discussed it around the official council table they were only prevented from carrying it into execution by the determined opposition of the friends and descendants of the lost guides who insisted on giving the remains christian burial and succeeded in their purpose a close watch had to be kept upon all the poor remnants and fragments to prevent embezzlement a few accessory odds and ends were sold rags and scraps of the coarse clothing were parted with at the rate equal to about twenty dollars a yard a piece of a lantern and one or two other trifles brought nearly their weight in gold and an englishman offered a pound sterling for a single breeches button chapter xli the fearful disaster of one of the most memorable of all the alpine catastrophes was that of july on the matterhorn already slightly referred to a few pages back the details of it are scarcely known in america to the vast majority of readers they are not known at all mr whympers account is the only authentic one i will import the chief portion of it into this book partly because of its intrinsic interest and partly because it gives such a vivid idea of what the perilous pastime of alp climbing is this was mr whympers ninth attempt during a series of years to vanquish that steep and stubborn pillar or rock it succeeded the other eight were failures no man had ever accomplished the ascent before though the attempts had been numerous mr whympers narrative we started from zermatt on the th of july at half past five on a brilliant and perfectly cloudless morning we were eight in number croz guide old peter taugwalder guide and his two sons lord f douglas mr hadow rev mr hudson and i to insure steady motion one tourist and one native walked together the youngest taugwalder fell to my share the wine bags also fell to my lot to carry and throughout the day after each drink i replenished them secretly with water so that at the next halt they were found fuller than before this was considered a good omen and little short of miraculous on the first day we did not intend to ascend to any great height and we mounted accordingly very leisurely before twelve o clock we had found a good position for the tent at a height of eleven thousand feet we passed the remaining hours of daylight some basking in the sunshine some sketching some collecting hudson made tea i coffee and at length we retired each one to his blanket bag we assembled together before dawn on the th and started directly it was light enough to move one of the young taugwalders returned to zermatt in a few minutes we turned the rib which had intercepted the view of the eastern face from our tent platform the whole of this great slope was now revealed rising for three thousand feet like a huge natural staircase some parts were more and others were less easy but we were not once brought to a halt by any serious impediment for when an obstruction was met in front it could always be turned to the right or to the left for the greater part of the way there was no occasion indeed for the rope and sometimes hudson led sometimes myself at six twenty we had attained a height of twelve thousand eight hundred feet and halted for half an hour we then continued the ascent without a break until nine fifty five when we stopped for fifty minutes at a height of fourteen thousand feet we had now arrived at the foot of that part which seen from the riffelberg seems perpendicular or overhanging we could no longer continue on the eastern side for a little distance we ascended by snow upon the ar te that is the ridge then turned over to the right or northern side the work became difficult and required caution in some places there was little to hold the general slope of the mountain was less than forty degrees and snow had accumulated in and had filled up the interstices of the rock face leaving only occasional fragments projecting here and there these were at times covered with a thin film of ice it was a place which any fair mountaineer might pass in safety we bore away nearly horizontally for about four hundred feet then ascended directly toward the summit for about sixty feet then doubled back to the ridge which descends toward zermatt a long stride round a rather awkward corner brought us to snow once more that last doubt vanished the matterhorn was ours nothing but two hundred feet of easy snow remained to be surmounted the higher we rose the more intense became the excitement the slope eased off at length we could be detached and croz and i dashed away ran a neck and neck race which ended in a dead heat atp m the world was at our feet and the matterhorn was conquered the others arrived croz now took the tent pole and planted it in the highest snow yes we said there is the flag staff but where is the flag here it is he answered pulling off his blouse and fixing it to the stick it made a poor flag and there was no wind to float it out yet it was seen all around they saw it at zermatt at the riffel in the val tournanche we remained on the summit for one hour one crowded hour of glorious life it passed away too quickly and we began to prepare for the descent hudson and i consulted as to the best and safest arrangement of the party we agreed that it was best for croz to go first and hadow second hudson who was almost equal to a guide in sureness of foot wished to be third lord douglas was placed next and old peter the strongest of the remainder after him i suggested to hudson that we should attach a rope to the rocks on our arrival at the difficult bit and hold it as we descended as an additional protection he approved the idea but it was not definitely decided that it should be done the party was being arranged in the above order while i was sketching the summit and they had finished and were waiting for me to be tied in line when some one remembered that our names had not been left in a bottle they requested me to write them down and moved off while it was being done a few minutes afterward i tied myself to young peter ran down after the others and caught them just as they were commencing the descent of the difficult part great care was being taken only one man was moving at a time when he was firmly planted the next advanced and so on they had not however attached the additional rope to rocks and nothing was said about it the suggestion was not made for my own sake and i am not sure that it ever occurred to me again for some little distance we two followed the others detached from them and should have continued so had not lord douglas asked me aboutp m to tie on to old peter as he feared he said that taugwalder would not be able to hold his ground if a slip occurred a few minutes later a sharp eyed lad ran into the monte rosa hotel at zermatt saying that he had seen an avalanche fall from the summit of the matterhorn onto the matterhorn glacier the boy was reproved for telling idle stories he was right nevertheless and this was what he saw michel croz had laid aside his ax and in order to give mr hadow greater security was absolutely taking hold of his legs and putting his feet one by one into their proper positions as far as i know no one was actually descending i cannot speak with certainty because the two leading men were partially hidden from my sight by an intervening mass of rock but it is my belief from the movements of their shoulders that croz having done as i said was in the act of turning round to go down a step or two himself at this moment mr hadow slipped fell against him and knocked him over i heard one startled exclamation from croz then saw him and mr hadow flying downward in another moment hudson was dragged from his steps and lord douglas immediately after him all this was the work of a moment immediately we heard crozs exclamation old peter and i planted ourselves as firmly as the rocks would permit the rope was taut between us and the jerk came on us both as on one man we held but the rope broke midway between taugwalder and lord francis douglas for a few seconds we saw our unfortunate companions sliding downward on their backs and spreading out their hands endeavoring to save themselves they passed from our sight uninjured disappeared one by one and fell from the precipice to precipice onto the matterhorn glacier below a distance of nearly four thousand feet in height from the moment the rope broke it was impossible to help them so perished our comrades for more than two hours afterward i thought almost every moment that the next would be my last for the taugwalders utterly unnerved were not only incapable of giving assistance but were in such a state that a slip might have been expected from them at any moment after a time we were able to do that which should have been done at first and fixed rope to firm rocks in addition to being tied together these ropes were cut from time to time and were left behind even with their assurance the men were afraid to proceed and several times old peter turned with ashy face and faltering limbs and said with terrible emphasis i cannot aboutp m we arrived at the snow upon the ridge descending toward zermatt and all peril was over we frequently looked but in vain for traces of our unfortunate companions we bent over the ridge and cried to them but no sound returned convinced at last that they were neither within sight nor hearing we ceased from our useless efforts and too cast down for speech silently gathered up our things and the little effects of those who were lost and then completed the descent such is mr whympers graphic and thrilling narrative zermatt gossip darkly hints that the elder taugwalder cut the rope when the accident occurred in order to preserve himself from being dragged into the abyss but mr whymper says that the ends of the rope showed no evidence of cutting but only of breaking he adds that if taugwalder had had the disposition to cut the rope he would not have had time to do it the accident was so sudden and unexpected lord douglas body has never been found it probably lodged upon some inaccessible shelf in the face of the mighty precipice lord douglas was a youth of nineteen the three other victims fell nearly four thousand feet and their bodies lay together upon the glacier when found by mr whymper and the other searchers the next morning their graves are beside the little church in zermatt chapter xlii chillon has a nice roomy dungeon switzerland is simply a large humpy solid rock with a thin skin of grass stretched over it consequently they do not dig graves they blast them out with powder and fuse they cannot afford to have large graveyards the grass skin is too circumscribed and too valuable it is all required for the support of the living the graveyard in zermatt occupies only about one eighth of an acre the graves are sunk in the living rock and are very permanent but occupation of them is only temporary the occupant can only stay till his grave is needed by a later subject he is removed then for they do not bury one body on top of another as i understand it a family owns a grave just as it owns a house a man dies and leaves his house to his son and at the same time this dead father succeeds to his own fathers grave he moves out of the house and into the grave and his predecessor moves out of the grave and into the cellar of the chapel i saw a black box lying in the churchyard with skull and cross bones painted on it and was told that this was used in transferring remains to the cellar in that cellar the bones and skulls of several hundred of former citizens were compactly corded up they made a pile eighteen feet long seven feet high and eight feet wide i was told that in some of the receptacles of this kind in the swiss villages the skulls were all marked and if a man wished to find the skulls of his ancestors for several generations back he could do it by these marks preserved in the family records an english gentleman who had lived some years in this region said it was the cradle of compulsory education but he said that the english idea that compulsory education would reduce bastardy and intemperance was an error it has not that effect he said there was more seduction in the protestant than in the catholic cantons because the confessional protected the girls i wonder why it doesnt protect married women in france and spain this gentleman said that among the poorer peasants in the valais it was common for the brothers in a family to cast lots to determine which of them should have the coveted privilege of marrying and his brethren doomed bachelors heroically banded themselves together to help support the new family we left zermatt in a wagon and in a rain storm too for st nicholas about ten o clock one morning again we passed between those grass clad prodigious cliffs specked with wee dwellings peeping over at us from velvety green walls ten and twelve hundred feet high it did not seem possible that the imaginary chamois even could climb those precipices lovers on opposite cliffs probably kiss through a spy glass and correspond with a rifle in switzerland the farmers plow is a wide shovel which scrapes up and turns over the thin earthy skin of his native rock and there the man of the plow is a hero now here by our st nicholas road was a grave and it had a tragic story a plowman was skinning his farm one morning not the steepest part of it but still a steep part that is he was not skinning the front of his farm but the roof of it near the eaves when he absent mindedly let go of the plow handles to moisten his hands in the usual way he lost his balance and fell out of his farm backward poor fellow he never touched anything till he struck bottom fifteen hundred feet below this was on a sundaym t we throw a halo of heroism around the life of the soldier and the sailor because of the deadly dangers they are facing all the time but we are not used to looking upon farming as a heroic occupation this is because we have not lived in switzerland from st nicholas we struck out for visp or vispach on foot the rain storms had been at work during several days and had done a deal of damage in switzerland and savoy we came to one place where a stream had changed its course and plunged down a mountain in a new place sweeping everything before it two poor but precious farms by the roadside were ruined one was washed clear away and the bed rock exposed the other was buried out of sight under a tumbled chaos of rocks gravel mud and rubbish the resistless might of water was well exemplified some saplings which had stood in the way were bent to the ground stripped clean of their bark and buried under rocky debris the road had been swept away too in another place where the road was high up on the mountains face and its outside edge protected by flimsy masonry we frequently came across spots where this masonry had carved off and left dangerous gaps for mules to get over and with still more frequency we found the masonry slightly crumbled and marked by mule hoofs thus showing that there had been danger of an accident to somebody when at last we came to a badly ruptured bit of masonry with hoof prints evidencing a desperate struggle to regain the lost foothold i looked quite hopefully over the dizzy precipice but there was nobody down there they take exceedingly good care of their rivers in switzerland and other portions of europe they wall up both banks with slanting solid stone masonry so that from end to end of these rivers the banks look like the wharves at st louis and other towns on the mississippi river it was during this walk from st nicholas in the shadow of the majestic alps that we came across some little children amusing themselves in what seemed at first a most odd and original way but it wasnt it was in simply a natural and characteristic way they were roped together with a string they had mimic alpenstocks and ice axes and were climbing a meek and lowly manure pile with a most blood curdling amount of care and caution the guide at the head of the line cut imaginary steps in a laborious and painstaking way and not a monkey budged till the step above was vacated if we had waited we should have witnessed an imaginary accident no doubt and we should have heard the intrepid band hurrah when they made the summit and looked around upon the magnificent view and seen them throw themselves down in exhausted attitudes for a rest in that commanding situation in nevada i used to see the children play at silver mining of course the great thing was an accident in a mine and there were two star parts that of the man who fell down the mimic shaft and that of the daring hero who was lowered into the depths to bring him up i knew one small chap who always insisted on playing both of these parts and he carried his point he would tumble into the shaft and die and then come to the surface and go back after his own remains it is the smartest boy that gets the hero part everywhere he is head guide in switzerland head miner in nevada head bull fighter in spain etc but i knew a preachers son seven years old who once selected a part for himself compared to which those just mentioned are tame and unimpressive jimmys father stopped him from driving imaginary horse cars one sunday stopped him from playing captain of an imaginary steamboat next sunday stopped him from leading an imaginary army to battle the following sunday and so on finally the little fellow said i ve tried everything and they wont any of them do what can i play i hardly know jimmy but you must play only things that are suitable to the sabbath day next sunday the preacher stepped softly to a back room door to see if the children were rightly employed he peeped in a chair occupied the middle of the room and on the back of it hung jimmys cap one of his little sisters took the cap down nibbled at it then passed it to another small sister and said eat of this fruit for it is good the reverend took in the situation alas they were playing the expulsion from eden yet he found one little crumb of comfort he said to himself for once jimmy has yielded the chief role i have been wronging him i did not believe there was so much modesty in him i should have expected him to be either adam or eve this crumb of comfort lasted but a very little while he glanced around and discovered jimmy standing in an imposing attitude in a corner with a dark and deadly frown on his face what that meant was very plain he was impersonating the deity think of the guileless sublimity of that idea we reached vispach atp m only about seven hours out from st nicholas so we must have made fully a mile and a half an hour and it was all downhill too and very muddy at that we stayed all night at the hotel de soleil i remember it because the landlady the portier the waitress and the chambermaid were not separate persons but were all contained in one neat and chipper suit of spotless muslin and she was the prettiest young creature i saw in all that region she was the landlords daughter and i remember that the only native match to her i saw in all europe was the young daughter of the landlord of a village inn in the black forest why dont more people in europe marry and keep hotel next morning we left with a family of english friends and went by train to brevet and thence by boat across the lake to ouchy lausanne ouchy is memorable to me not on account of its beautiful situation and lovely surroundings although these would make it stick long in ones memory but as the place where i caught the london times dropping into humor it was not aware of it though it did not do it on purpose an english friend called my attention to this lapse and cut out the reprehensible paragraph for me think of encountering a grin like this on the face of that grim journal erratum we are requested by reuters telegram company to correct an erroneous announcement made in their brisbane telegram of thed inst published in our impression of the th inst stating that lady kennedy had given birth to twins the eldest being a son the company explain that the message they received contained the words governor of queensland twins first son being however subsequently informed that sir arthur kennedy was unmarried and that there must be some mistake a telegraphic repetition was at once demanded it has been received today th inst and shows that the words really telegraphed by reuters agent were governor queensland turns first sod alluding to the maryborough gympic railway in course of construction the words in italics were mutilated by the telegraph in transmission from australia and reaching the company in the form mentioned above gave rise to the mistake i had always had a deep and reverent compassion for the sufferings of the prisoner of chillon whose story byron had told in such moving verse so i took the steamer and made pilgrimage to the dungeons of the castle of chillon to see the place where poor bonnivard endured his dreary captivity three hundred years ago i am glad i did that for it took away some of the pain i was feeling on the prisoners account his dungeon was a nice cool roomy place and i cannot see why he should have been dissatisfied with it if he had been imprisoned in a st nicholas private dwelling where the fertilizer prevails and the goat sleeps with the guest and the chickens roost on him and the cow comes in and bothers him when he wants to muse it would have been another matter altogether but he surely could not have had a very cheerless time of it in that pretty dungeon it has romantic window slits that let in generous bars of light and it has tall noble columns carved apparently from the living rock and what is more they are written all over with thousands of names some of them like byrons and victor hugos of the first celebrity why didnt he amuse himself reading these names then there are the couriers and tourists swarms of them every day what was to hinder him from having a good time with them i think bonnivards sufferings have been overrated next we took the train and went to martigny on the way to mont blanc next morning we started about eight o clock on foot we had plenty of company in the way of wagon loads and mule loads of tourists and dust this scattering procession of travelers was perhaps a mile long the road was uphill interminable uphill and tolerably steep the weather was blisteringly hot and the man or woman who had to sit on a creeping mule or in a crawling wagon and broil in the beating sun was an object to be pitied we could dodge among the bushes and have the relief of shade but those people could not they paid for a conveyance and to get their moneys worth they rode we went by the way of the t te noir and after we reached high ground there was no lack of fine scenery in one place the road was tunneled through a shoulder of the mountain from there one looked down into a gorge with a rushing torrent in it and on every hand was a charming view of rocky buttresses and wooded heights there was a liberal allowance of pretty waterfalls too on the t te noir route about half an hour before we reached the village of argenti re a vast dome of snow with the sun blazing on it drifted into view and framed itself in a strong v shaped gateway of the mountains and we recognized mont blanc the monarch of the alps with every step after that this stately dome rose higher and higher into the blue sky and at last seemed to occupy the zenith some of mont blancs neighbors bare light brown steeplelike rocks were very peculiarly shaped some were whittled to a sharp point and slightly bent at the upper end like a ladys finger one monster sugar loaf resembled a bishops hat it was too steep to hold snow on its sides but had some in the division while we were still on very high ground and before the descent toward argenti re began we looked up toward a neighboring mountain top and saw exquisite prismatic colors playing about some white clouds which were so delicate as to almost resemble gossamer webs the faint pinks and greens were peculiarly beautiful none of the colors were deep they were the lightest shades they were bewitching commingled we sat down to study and enjoy this singular spectacle the tints remained during several minutes flitting changing melting into each other paling almost away for a moment then reflushing a shifting restless unstable succession of soft opaline gleams shimmering over that air film of white cloud and turning it into a fabric dainty enough to clothe an angel with by and by we perceived what those super delicate colors and their continuous play and movement reminded us of it is what one sees in a soap bubble that is drifting along catching changes of tint from the objects it passes a soap bubble is the most beautiful thing and the most exquisite in nature that lovely phantom fabric in the sky was suggestive of a soap bubble split open and spread out in the sun i wonder how much it would take to buy a soap bubble if there was only one in the world one could buy a hatful of koh i noors with the same money no doubt we made the tramp from martigny to argenti re in eight hours we beat all the mules and wagons we didnt usually do that we hired a sort of open baggage wagon for the trip down the valley to chamonix and then devoted an hour to dining this gave the driver time to get drunk he had a friend with him and this friend also had had time to get drunk when we drove off the driver said all the tourists had arrived and gone by while we were at dinner but said he impressively be not disturbed by that remain tranquil give yourselves no uneasiness their dust rises far before us rest you tranquil leave all to me i am the king of drivers behold down came his whip and away we clattered i never had such a shaking up in my life the recent flooding rains had washed the road clear away in places but we never stopped we never slowed down for anything we tore right along over rocks rubbish gullies open fields sometimes with one or two wheels on the ground but generally with none every now and then that calm good natured madman would bend a majestic look over his shoulder at us and say ah you perceive it is as i have said i am the king of drivers every time we just missed going to destruction he would say with tranquil happiness enjoy it gentlemen it is very rare it is very unusual it is given to few to ride with the king of drivers and observe it is as i have said i am he he spoke in french and punctuated with hiccoughs his friend was french too but spoke in german using the same system of punctuation however the friend called himself the captain of mont blanc and wanted us to make the ascent with him he said he had made more ascents than any other man forty seven and his brother had made thirty seven his brother was the best guide in the world except himself but he yes observe him well he was the captain of mont blanc that title belonged to none other the king was as good as his word he overtook that long procession of tourists and went by it like a hurricane the result was that we got choicer rooms at the hotel in chamonix than we should have done if his majesty had been a slower artist or rather if he hadnt most providentially got drunk before he left argenti re a tramp abroad part by

principal street of the village not on the sidewalks but all over the street everybody was lounging loafing chatting waiting alert expectant interested for it was train time that is to say it was diligence time the half dozen big diligences would soon be arriving from geneva and the village was interested in many ways in knowing how many people were coming and what sort of folk they might be it was altogether the livest looking street we had seen in any village on the continent the hotel was by the side of a booming torrent whose music was loud and strong we could not see this torrent for it was dark now but one could locate it without a light there was a large enclosed yard in front of the hotel and this was filled with groups of villagers waiting to see the diligences arrive or to hire themselves to excursionists for the morrow a telescope stood in the yard with its huge barrel canted up toward the lustrous evening star the long porch of the hotel was populous with tourists who sat in shawls and wraps under the vast overshadowing bulk of mont blanc and gossiped or meditated never did a mountain seem so close its big sides seemed at ones very elbow and its majestic dome and the lofty cluster of slender minarets that were its neighbors seemed to be almost over ones head it was night in the streets and the lamps were sparkling everywhere the broad bases and shoulders of the mountains were in a deep gloom but their summits swam in a strange rich glow which was really daylight and yet had a mellow something about it which was very different from the hard white glare of the kind of daylight i was used to its radiance was strong and clear but at the same time it was singularly soft and spiritual and benignant no it was not our harsh aggressive realistic daylight it seemed properer to an enchanted land or to heaven i had seen moonlight and daylight together before but i had not seen daylight and black night elbow to elbow before at least i had not seen the daylight resting upon an object sufficiently close at hand before to make the contrast startling and at war with nature the daylight passed away presently the moon rose up behind some of those sky piercing fingers or pinnacles of bare rock of which i have spoken they were a little to the left of the crest of mont blanc and right over our heads but she couldnt manage to climb high enough toward heaven to get entirely above them she would show the glittering arch of her upper third occasionally and scrape it along behind the comblike row sometimes a pinnacle stood straight up like a statuette of ebony against that glittering white shield then seemed to glide out of it by its own volition and power and become a dim specter while the next pinnacle glided into its place and blotted the spotless disk with the black exclamation point of its presence the top of one pinnacle took the shapely clean cut form of a rabbits head in the inkiest silhouette while it rested against the moon the unillumined peaks and minarets hovering vague and phantom like above us while the others were painfully white and strong with snow and moonlight made a peculiar effect but when the moon having passed the line of pinnacles was hidden behind the stupendous white swell of mont blanc the masterpiece of the evening was flung on the canvas a rich greenish radiance sprang into the sky from behind the mountain and in this some airy shreds and ribbons of vapor floated about and being flushed with that strange tint went waving to and fro like pale green flames after a while radiating bars vast broadening fan shaped shadows grew up and stretched away to the zenith from behind the mountain it was a spectacle to take ones breath for the wonder of it and the sublimity indeed those mighty bars of alternate light and shadow streaming up from behind that dark and prodigious form and occupying the half of the dull and opaque heavens was the most imposing and impressive marvel i had ever looked upon there is no simile for it for nothing is like it if a child had asked me what it was i should have said humble yourself in this presence it is the glory flowing from the hidden head of the creator one falls shorter of the truth than that sometimes in trying to explain mysteries to the little people i could have found out the cause of this awe compelling miracle by inquiring for it is not infrequent at mont blanc but i did not wish to know we have not the reverent feeling for the rainbow that a savage has because we know how it is made we have lost as much as we gained by prying into the matter we took a walk down street a block or two and a place where four streets met and the principal shops were clustered found the groups of men in the roadway thicker than ever for this was the exchange of chamonix these men were in the costumes of guides and porters and were there to be hired the office of that great personage the guide in chief of the chamonix guild of guides was near by this guild is a close corporation and is governed by strict laws there are many excursion routes some dangerous and some not some that can be made safely without a guide and some that cannot the bureau determines these things where it decides that a guide is necessary you are forbidden to go without one neither are you allowed to be a victim of extortion the law states what you are to pay the guides serve in rotation you cannot select the man who is to take your life into his hands you must take the worst in the lot if it is his turn a guides fee ranges all the way up from a half dollar for some trifling excursion of a few rods to twenty dollars according to the distance traversed and the nature of the ground a guides fee for taking a person to the summit of mont blanc and back is twenty dollars and he earns it the time employed is usually three days and there is enough early rising in it to make a man far more healthy and wealthy and wise than any one man has any right to be the porters fee for the same trip is ten dollars several fools no i mean several tourists usually go together and divide up the expense and thus make it light for if only one f tourist i mean went he would have to have several guides and porters and that would make the matter costly we went into the chiefs office there were maps of mountains on the walls also one or two lithographs of celebrated guides and a portrait of the scientist de saussure in glass cases were some labeled fragments of boots and batons and other suggestive relics and remembrances of casualties on mount blanc in a book was a record of all the ascents which have ever been made beginning with nos and being those of jacques balmat and de saussure in and ending with no which wasnt cold yet in fact no was standing by the official table waiting to receive the precious official diploma which should prove to his german household and to his descendants that he had once been indiscreet enough to climb to the top of mont blanc he looked very happy when he got his document in fact he spoke up and said he was happy i tried to buy a diploma for an invalid friend at home who had never traveled and whose desire all his life has been to ascend mont blanc but the guide in chief rather insolently refused to sell me one i was very much offended i said i did not propose to be discriminated against on the account of my nationality that he had just sold a diploma to this german gentleman and my money was a good as his i would see to it that he couldnt keep his shop for germans and deny his produce to americans i would have his license taken away from him at the dropping of a handkerchief if france refused to break him i would make an international matter of it and bring on a war the soil should be drenched with blood and not only that but i would set up an opposition show and sell diplomas at half price for two cents i would have done these things too but nobody offered me two cents i tried to move that germans feelings but it could not be done he would not give me his diploma neither would he sell it to me i told him my friend was sick and could not come himself but he said he did not care a verdammtes pfennig he wanted his diploma for himself did i suppose he was going to risk his neck for that thing and then give it to a sick stranger indeed he wouldnt so he wouldnt i resolved then that i would do all i could to injure mont blanc in the record book was a list of all the fatal accidents which happened on the mountain it began with the one in when the russian dr hamels three guides were lost in a crevice of the glacier and it recorded the delivery of the remains in the valley by the slow moving glacier forty one years later the latest catastrophe bore the date we stepped out and roved about the village awhile in front of the little church was a monument to the memory of the bold guide jacques balmat the first man who ever stood upon the summit of mont blanc he made that wild trip solitary and alone he accomplished the ascent a number of times afterward a stretch of nearly half a century lay between his first ascent and his last one at the ripe old age of seventy two he was climbing around a corner of a lofty precipice of the pic du midi nobody with him when he slipped and fell so he died in the harness he had grown very avaricious in his old age and used to go off stealthily to hunt for non existent and impossible gold among those perilous peaks and precipices he was on a quest of that kind when he lost his life there was a statue to him and another to de saussure in the hall of our hotel and a metal plate on the door of a room upstairs bore an inscription to the effect that that room had been occupied by albert smith balmat and de saussure discovered mont blanc so to speak but it was smith who made it a paying property his articles in blackwood and his lectures on mont blanc in london advertised it and made people as anxious to see it as if it owed them money as we strolled along the road we looked up and saw a red signal light glowing in the darkness of the mountainside it seemed but a trifling way up perhaps a hundred yards a climb of ten minutes it was a lucky piece of sagacity in us that we concluded to stop a man whom we met and get a light for our pipes from him instead of continuing the climb to that lantern to get a light as had been our purpose the man said that that lantern was on the grands mulets some sixty five hundred feet above the valley i know by our riffelberg experience that it would have taken us a good part of a week to go up there i would sooner not smoke at all than take all that trouble for a light even in the daytime the foreshadowing effect of this mountains close proximity creates curious deceptions for instance one sees with the naked eye a cabin up there beside the glacier and a little above and beyond he sees the spot where that red light was located he thinks he could throw a stone from the one place to the other but he couldnt for the difference between the two altitudes is more than three thousand feet it looks impossible from below that this can be true but it is true nevertheless while strolling around we kept the run of the moon all the time and we still kept an eye on her after we got back to the hotel portico i had a theory that the gravitation of refraction being subsidiary to atmospheric compensation the refrangibility of the earths surface would emphasize this effect in regions where great mountain ranges occur and possibly so even handed impact the odic and idyllic forces together the one upon the other as to prevent the moon from rising higher than feet above sea level this daring theory had been received with frantic scorn by some of my fellow scientists and with an eager silence by others among the former i may mention profh y and among the latter proft l such is professional jealousy a scientist will never show any kindness for a theory which he did not start himself there is no feeling of brotherhood among these people indeed they always resent it when i call them brother to show how far their ungenerosity can carry them i will state that i offered to let profh y publish my great theory as his own discovery i even begged him to do it i even proposed to print it myself as his theory instead of thanking me he said that if i tried to fasten that theory on him he would sue me for slander i was going to offer it to mr darwin whom i understood to be a man without prejudices but it occurred to me that perhaps he would not be interested in it since it did not concern heraldry but i am glad now that i was forced to father my intrepid theory myself for on the night of which i am writing it was triumphantly justified and established mont blanc is nearly sixteen thousand feet high he hid the moon utterly near him is a peak which is feet high the moon slid along behind the pinnacles and when she approached that one i watched her with intense interest for my reputation as a scientist must stand or fall by its decision i cannot describe the emotions which surged like tidal waves through my breast when i saw the moon glide behind that lofty needle and pass it by without exposing more than two feet four inches of her upper rim above it i was secure then i knew she could rise no higher and i was right she sailed behind all the peaks and never succeeded in hoisting her disk above a single one of them while the moon was behind one of those sharp fingers its shadow was flung athwart the vacant heavens a long slanting clean cut dark ray with a streaming and energetic suggestion of force about it such as the ascending jet of water from a powerful fire engine affords it was curious to see a good strong shadow of an earthly object cast upon so intangible a field as the atmosphere we went to bed at last and went quickly to sleep but i woke up after about three hours with throbbing temples and a head which was physically sore outside and in i was dazed dreamy wretched seedy unrefreshed i recognized the occasion of all this it was that torrent in the mountain villages of switzerland and along the roads one has always the roar of the torrent in his ears he imagines it is music and he thinks poetic things about it he lies in his comfortable bed and is lulled to sleep by it but by and by he begins to notice that his head is very sore he cannot account for it in solitudes where the profoundest silence reigns he notices a sullen distant continuous roar in his ears which is like what he would experience if he had sea shells pressed against them he cannot account for it he is drowsy and absent minded there is no tenacity to his mind he cannot keep hold of a thought and follow it out if he sits down to write his vocabulary is empty no suitable words will come he forgets what he started to do and remains there pen in hand head tilted up eyes closed listening painfully to the muffled roar of a distant train in his ears in his soundest sleep the strain continues he goes on listening always listening intently anxiously and wakes at last harassed irritable unrefreshed he cannot manage to account for these things day after day he feels as if he had spent his nights in a sleeping car it actually takes him weeks to find out that it is those persecuting torrents that have been making all the mischief it is time for him to get out of switzerland then for as soon as he has discovered the cause the misery is magnified several fold the roar of the torrent is maddening then for his imagination is assisting the physical pain it inflicts is exquisite when he finds he is approaching one of those streams his dread is so lively that he is disposed to fly the track and avoid the implacable foe eight or nine months after the distress of the torrents had departed from me the roar and thunder of the streets of paris brought it all back again i moved to the sixth story of the hotel to hunt for peace about midnight the noises dulled away and i was sinking to sleep when i heard a new and curious sound i listened evidently some joyous lunatic was softly dancing a double shuffle in the room over my head i had to wait for him to get through of course five long long minutes he smoothly shuffled away a pause followed then something fell with a thump on the floor i said to myself there he is pulling off his boots thank heavens he is done another slight pause he went to shuffling again i said to myself is he trying to see what he can do with only one boot on presently came another pause and another thump on the floor i said good he has pulled off his other boot now he is done but he wasnt the next moment he was shuffling again i said confound him he is at it in his slippers after a little came that same old pause and right after it that thump on the floor once more i said hang him he had on two pair of boots for an hour that magician went on shuffling and pulling off boots till he had shed as many as twenty five pair and i was hovering on the verge of lunacy i got my gun and stole up there the fellow was in the midst of an acre of sprawling boots and he had a boot in his hand shuffling it no i mean polishing it the mystery was explained he hadnt been dancing he was the boots of the hotel and was attending to business chapter xlix i scale mont blanc by telescope after breakfast that next morning in chamonix we went out in the yard and watched the gangs of excursioning tourists arriving and departing with their mules and guides and porters then we took a look through the telescope at the snowy hump of mont blanc it was brilliant with sunshine and the vast smooth bulge seemed hardly five hundred yards away with the naked eye we could dimly make out the house at the pierre pointue which is located by the side of the great glacier and is more than three thousand feet above the level of the valley but with the telescope we could see all its details while i looked a woman rode by the house on a mule and i saw her with sharp distinctness i could have described her dress i saw her nod to the people of the house and rein up her mule and put her hand up to shield her eyes from the sun i was not used to telescopes in fact i had never looked through a good one before it seemed incredible to me that this woman could be so far away i was satisfied that i could see all these details with my naked eye but when i tried it that mule and those vivid people had wholly vanished and the house itself was become small and vague i tried the telescope again and again everything was vivid the strong black shadows of the mule and the woman were flung against the side of the house and i saw the mules silhouette wave its ears the telescopulist or the telescopulariat i do not know which is right said a party were making a grand ascent and would come in sight on the remote upper heights presently so we waited to observe this performance presently i had a superb idea i wanted to stand with a party on the summit of mont blanc merely to be able to say i had done it and i believed the telescope could set me within seven feet of the uppermost man the telescoper assured me that it could i then asked him how much i owed him for as far as i had got he said one franc i asked him how much it would cost to make the entire ascent three francs i at once determined to make the entire ascent but first i inquired if there was any danger he said no not by telescope said he had taken a great many parties to the summit and never lost a man i asked what he would charge to let my agent go with me together with such guides and porters as might be necessary he said he would let harris go for two francs and that unless we were unusually timid he should consider guides and porters unnecessary it was not customary to take them when going by telescope for they were rather an encumbrance than a help he said that the party now on the mountain were approaching the most difficult part and if we hurried we should overtake them within ten minutes and could then join them and have the benefit of their guides and porters without their knowledge and without expense to us i then said we would start immediately i believe i said it calmly though i was conscious of a shudder and of a paling cheek in view of the nature of the exploit i was so unreflectingly engaged in but the old daredevil spirit was upon me and i said that as i had committed myself i would not back down i would ascend mont blanc if it cost me my life i told the man to slant his machine in the proper direction and let us be off harris was afraid and did not want to go but i heartened him up and said i would hold his hand all the way so he gave his consent though he trembled a little at first i took a last pathetic look upon the pleasant summer scene about me then boldly put my eye to the glass and prepared to mount among the grim glaciers and the everlasting snows we took our way carefully and cautiously across the great glacier des bossons over yawning and terrific crevices and among imposing crags and buttresses of ice which were fringed with icicles of gigantic proportions the desert of ice that stretched far and wide about us was wild and desolate beyond description and the perils which beset us were so great that at times i was minded to turn back but i pulled my pluck together and pushed on we passed the glacier safely and began to mount the steeps beyond with great alacrity when we were seven minutes out from the starting point we reached an altitude where the scene took a new aspect an apparently limitless continent of gleaming snow was tilted heavenward before our faces as my eye followed that awful acclivity far away up into the remote skies it seemed to me that all i had ever seen before of sublimity and magnitude was small and insignificant compared to this we rested a moment and then began to mount with speed within three minutes we caught sight of the party ahead of us and stopped to observe them they were toiling up a long slanting ridge of snow twelve persons roped together some fifteen feet apart marching in single file and strongly marked against the clear blue sky one was a woman we could see them lift their feet and put them down we saw them swing their alpenstocks forward in unison like so many pendulums and then bear their weight upon them we saw the lady wave her handkerchief they dragged themselves upward in a worn and weary way for they had been climbing steadily from the grand mulets on the glacier des bossons since three in the morning and it was eleven now we saw them sink down in the snow and rest and drink something from a bottle after a while they moved on and as they approached the final short dash of the home stretch we closed up on them and joined them presently we all stood together on the summit what a view was spread out below away off under the northwestern horizon rolled the silent billows of the farnese oberland their snowy crests glinting softly in the subdued lights of distance in the north rose the giant form of the wobblehorn draped from peak to shoulder in sable thunder clouds beyond him to the right stretched the grand processional summits of the cisalpine cordillera drowned in a sensuous haze to the east loomed the colossal masses of the yodelhorn the fuddelhorn and the dinnerhorn their cloudless summits flashing white and cold in the sun beyond them shimmered the faint far line of the ghauts of jubbelpore and the aiguilles des alleghenies in the south towered the smoking peak of popocatapetl and the unapproachable altitudes of the peerless scrabblehorn in the west south the stately range of the himalayas lay dreaming in a purple gloom and thence all around the curving horizon the eye roved over a troubled sea of sun kissed alps and noted here and there the noble proportions and the soaring domes of the bottlehorn and the saddlehorn and the shovelhorn and the powderhorn all bathed in the glory of noon and mottled with softly gliding blots the shadows flung from drifting clouds overcome by the scene we all raised a triumphant tremendous shout in unison a startled man at my elbow said confound you what do you yell like that for right here in the street that brought me down to chamonix like a flirt i gave that man some spiritual advice and disposed of him and then paid the telescope man his full fee and said that we were charmed with the trip and would remain down and not reascend and require him to fetch us down by telescope this pleased him very much for of course we could have stepped back to the summit and put him to the trouble of bringing us home if we wanted to i judged we could get diplomas now anyhow so we went after them but the chief guide put us off with one pretext or another during all the time we stayed in chamonix and we ended by never getting them at all so much for his prejudice against peoples nationality however we worried him enough to make him remember us and our ascent for some time he even said once that he wished there was a lunatic asylum in chamonix this shows that he really had fears that we were going to drive him mad it was what we intended to do but lack of time defeated it i cannot venture to advise the reader one way or the other as to ascending mont blanc i say only this if he is at all timid the enjoyments of the trip will hardly make up for the hardships and sufferings he will have to endure but if he has good nerve youth health and a bold firm will and could leave his family comfortably provided for in case the worst happened he would find the ascent a wonderful experience and the view from the top a vision to dream about and tell about and recall with exultation all the days of his life while i do not advise such a person to attempt the ascent i do not advise him against it but if he elects to attempt it let him be warily careful of two things chose a calm clear day and do not pay the telescope man in advance there are dark stories of his getting advance payers on the summit and then leaving them there to rot a frightful tragedy was once witnessed through the chamonix telescopes think of questions and answers like these on an inquest coroner you saw deceased lose his life witness i did c where was he at the time w close to the summit of mont blanc c where were you w in the main street of chamonix c what was the distance between you w a little over five miles as the bird flies this accident occurred in a year and a month after the disaster on the matterhorn three adventurous english gentlemen of great experience in mountain climbing made up their minds to ascend mont blanc without guides or porters all endeavors to dissuade them from their project failed powerful telescopes are numerous in chamonix these huge brass tubes mounted on their scaffoldings and pointed skyward from every choice vantage ground have the formidable look of artillery and give the town the general aspect of getting ready to repel a charge of angels the reader may easily believe that the telescopes had plenty of custom on that august morning in for everybody knew of the dangerous undertaking which was on foot and all had fears that misfortune would result all the morning the tubes remained directed toward the mountain heights each with its anxious group around it but the white deserts were vacant sir george young and his brothers james and albert at last toward eleven o clock the people who were looking through the telescopes cried out there they are and sure enough far up on the loftiest terraces of the grand plateau the three pygmies appeared climbing with remarkable vigor and spirit they disappeared in the corridor and were lost to sight during an hour then they reappeared and were presently seen standing together upon the extreme summit of mont blanc so all was well they remained a few minutes on that highest point of land in europe a target for all the telescopes and were then seen to begin descent suddenly all three vanished an instant after they appeared again two thousand feet below evidently they had tripped and been shot down an almost perpendicular slope of ice to a point where it joined the border of the upper glacier naturally the distant witness supposed they were now looking upon three corpses so they could hardly believe their eyes when they presently saw two of the men rise to their feet and bend over the third during two hours and a half they watched the two busying themselves over the extended form of their brother who seemed entirely inert chamonixs affairs stood still everybody was in the street all interest was centered upon what was going on upon that lofty and isolated stage five miles away finally the two one of them walking with great difficulty were seen to begin descent abandoning the third who was no doubt lifeless their movements were followed step by step until they reached the corridor and disappeared behind its ridge before they had had time to traverse the corridor and reappear twilight was come and the power of the telescope was at an end the survivors had a most perilous journey before them in the gathering darkness for they must get down to the grands mulets before they would find a safe stopping place a long and tedious descent and perilous enough even in good daylight the oldest guides expressed the opinion that they could not succeed that all the chances were that they would lose their lives yet those brave men did succeed they reached the grands mulets in safety even the fearful shock which their nerves had sustained was not sufficient to overcome their coolness and courage it would appear from the official account that they were threading their way down through those dangers from the closing in of twilight until two o clock in the morning or later because the rescuing party from chamonix reached the grand mulets about three in the morning and moved thence toward the scene of the disaster under the leadership of sir george young who had only just arrived after having been on his feet twenty four hours in the exhausting work of mountain climbing sir george began the reascent at the head of the relief party of six guides to recover the corpse of his brother this was considered a new imprudence as the number was too few for the service required another relief party presently arrived at the cabin on the grands mulets and quartered themselves there to await events ten hours after sir georges departure toward the summit this new relief were still scanning the snowy altitudes above them from their own high perch among the ice deserts ten thousand feet above the level of the sea but the whole forenoon had passed without a glimpse of any living thing appearing up there this was alarming half a dozen of their number set out then early in the afternoon to seek and succor sir george and his guides the persons remaining at the cabin saw these disappear and then ensued another distressing wait four hours passed without tidings then at five o clock another relief consisting of three guides set forward from the cabin they carried food and cordials for the refreshment of their predecessors they took lanterns with them too night was coming on and to make matters worse a fine cold rain had begun to fall at the same hour that these three began their dangerous ascent the official guide in chief of the mont blanc region undertook the dangerous descent to chamonix all alone to get reinforcements however a couple of hours later atp m the anxious solicitude came to an end and happily a bugle note was heard and a cluster of black specks was distinguishable against the snows of the upper heights the watchers counted these specks eagerly fourteen nobody was missing an hour and a half later they were all safe under the roof of the cabin they had brought the corpse with them sir george young tarried there but a few minutes and then began the long and troublesome descent from the cabin to chamonix he probably reached there about two or three o clock in the morning after having been afoot among the rocks and glaciers during two days and two nights his endurance was equal to his daring the cause of the unaccountable delay of sir george and the relief parties among the heights where the disaster had happened was a thick fog or partly that and partly the slow and difficult work of conveying the dead body down the perilous steeps the corpse upon being viewed at the inquest showed no bruises and it was some time before the surgeons discovered that the neck was broken one of the surviving brothers had sustained some unimportant injuries but the other had suffered no hurt at all how these men could fall two thousand feet almost perpendicularly and live afterward is a most strange and unaccountable thing a great many women have made the ascent of mont blanc an english girl miss stratton conceived the daring idea two or three years ago of attempting the ascent in the middle of winter she tried it and she succeeded moreover she froze two of her fingers on the way up she fell in love with her guide on the summit and she married him when she got to the bottom again there is nothing in romance in the way of a striking situation which can beat this love scene in midheaven on an isolated ice crest with the thermometer at zero and an artic gale blowing the first woman who ascended mont blanc was a girl aged twenty two mlle maria paradis nobody was with her but her sweetheart and he was not a guide the sex then took a rest for about thirty years when a mlled angeville made the ascent in chamonix i picked up a rude old lithograph of that day which pictured her in the act however i value it less as a work of art than as a fashion plate miss d angeville put on a pair of mens pantaloons to climb it which was wise but she cramped their utility by adding her petticoat which was idiotic one of the mournfulest calamities which mens disposition to climb dangerous mountains has resulted in happened on mont blanc in september m d arve tells the story briefly in his histoire du mont blanc in the next chapter i will copy its chief features chapter xlv a catastrophe which cost eleven lives on the th of september a caravan of eleven persons departed from chamonix to make the ascent of mont blanc three of the party were tourists messrs randall and bean americans and mr george corkindale a scotch gentleman there were three guides and five porters the cabin on the grands mulets was reached that day the ascent was resumed early the next morning september th the day was fine and clear and the movements of the party were observed through the telescopes of chamonix at two o clock in the afternoon they were seen to reach the summit a few minutes later they were seen making the first steps of the descent then a cloud closed around them and hid them from view eight hours passed the cloud still remained night came no one had returned to the grands mulets sylvain couttet keeper of the cabin there suspected a misfortune and sent down to the valley for help a detachment of guides went up but by the time they had made the tedious trip and reached the cabin a raging storm had set in they had to wait nothing could be attempted in such a tempest the wild storm lasted more than a week without ceasing but on the th couttet with several guides left the cabin and succeeded in making the ascent in the snowy wastes near the summit they came upon five bodies lying upon their sides in a reposeful attitude which suggested that possibly they had fallen asleep there while exhausted with fatigue and hunger and benumbed with cold and never knew when death stole upon them couttet moved a few steps further and discovered five more bodies the eleventh corpse that of a porter was not found although diligent search was made for it in the pocket of mr bean one of the americans was found a note book in which had been penciled some sentences which admit us in flesh and spirit as it were to the presence of these men during their last hours of life and to the grisly horrors which their fading vision looked upon and their failing consciousness took cognizance of tuesday sept i have made the ascent of mont blanc with ten persons eight guides and mr corkindale and mr randall we reached the summit at half past immediately after quitting it we were enveloped in clouds of snow we passed the night in a grotto hollowed in the snow which afforded us but poor shelter and i was ill all night sept morning the cold is excessive the snow falls heavily and without interruption the guides take no rest evening my dear hessie we have been two days on mont blanc in the midst of a terrible hurricane of snow we have lost our way and are in a hole scooped in the snow at an altitude of feet i have no longer any hope of descending they had wandered around and around in the blinding snow storm hopelessly lost in a space only a hundred yards square and when cold and fatigue vanquished them at last they scooped their cave and lay down there to die by inches unaware that five steps more would have brought them into the truth path they were so near to life and safety as that and did not suspect it the thought of this gives the sharpest pang that the tragic story conveys the author of the histoire du mont blanc introduced the closing sentences of mr beans pathetic record thus here the characters are large and unsteady the hand which traces them is become chilled and torpid but the spirit survives and the faith and resignation of the dying man are expressed with a sublime simplicity perhaps this note book will be found and sent to you we have nothing to eat my feet are already frozen and i am exhausted i have strength to write only a few words more i have left means for cs education i know you will employ them wisely i die with faith in god and with loving thoughts of you farewell to all we shall meet again in heaven i think of you always it is the way of the alps to deliver death to their victims with a merciful swiftness but here the rule failed these men suffered the bitterest death that has been recorded in the history of those mountains freighted as that history is with grisly tragedies chapter xlvi meeting a hog on a precipice mr harris and i took some guides and porters and ascended to the hotel des pyramides which is perched on the high moraine which borders the glacier des bossons the road led sharply uphill all the way through grass and flowers and woods and was a pleasant walk barring the fatigue of the climb from the hotel we could view the huge glacier at very close range after a rest we followed down a path which had been made in the steep inner frontage of the moraine and stepped upon the glacier itself one of the shows of the place was a tunnel like cavern which had been hewn in the glacier the proprietor of this tunnel took candles and conducted us into it it was three or four feet wide and about six feet high its walls of pure and solid ice emitted a soft and rich blue light that produced a lovely effect and suggested enchanted caves and that sort of thing when we had proceeded some yards and were entering darkness we turned about and had a dainty sunlit picture of distant woods and heights framed in the strong arch of the tunnel and seen through the tender blue radiance of the tunnels atmosphere the cavern was nearly a hundred yards long and when we reached its inner limit the proprietor stepped into a branch tunnel with his candles and left us buried in the bowels of the glacier and in pitch darkness we judged his purpose was murder and robbery so we got out our matches and prepared to sell our lives as dearly as possible by setting the glacier on fire if the worst came to the worst but we soon perceived that this man had changed his mind he began to sing in a deep melodious voice and woke some curious and pleasing echoes by and by he came back and pretended that that was what he had gone behind there for we believed as much of that as we wanted to thus our lives had been once more in imminent peril but by the exercise of the swift sagacity and cool courage which had saved us so often we had added another escape to the long list the tourist should visit that ice cavern by all means for it is well worth the trouble but i would advise him to go only with a strong and well armed force i do not consider artillery necessary yet it would not be unadvisable to take it along if convenient the journey going and coming is about three miles and a half three of which are on level ground we made it in less than a day but i would counsel the unpracticed if not pressed for time to allow themselves two nothing is gained in the alps by over exertion nothing is gained by crowding two days work into one for the poor sake of being able to boast of the exploit afterward it will be found much better in the long run to do the thing in two days and then subtract one of them from the narrative this saves fatigue and does not injure the narrative all the more thoughtful among the alpine tourists do this we now called upon the guide in chief and asked for a squadron of guides and porters for the ascent of the montanvert this idiot glared at us and said you dont need guides and porters to go to the montanvert what do we need then such as you an ambulance i was so stung by this brutal remark that i took my custom elsewhere betimes next morning we had reached an altitude of five thousand feet above the level of the sea here we camped and breakfasted there was a cabin there the spot is called the caillet and a spring of ice cold water on the door of the cabin was a sign in french to the effect that one may here see a living chamois for fifty centimes we did not invest what we wanted was to see a dead one a little after noon we ended the ascent and arrived at the new hotel on the montanvert and had a view of six miles right up the great glacier the famous mer de glace at this point it is like a sea whose deep swales and long rolling swells have been caught in mid movement and frozen solid but further up it is broken up into wildly tossing billows of ice we descended a ticklish path in the steep side of the moraine and invaded the glacier there were tourists of both sexes scattered far and wide over it everywhere and it had the festive look of a skating rink the empress josephine came this far once she ascended the montanvert in but not alone a small army of men preceded her to clear the path and carpet it perhaps and she followed under the protection of sixty eight guides her successor visited chamonix later but in far different style it was seven weeks after the first fall of the empire and poor marie louise ex empress was a fugitive she came at night and in a storm with only two attendants and stood before a peasants hut tired bedraggled soaked with rain the red print of her lost crown still girdling her brow and implored admittance and was refused a few days before the adulations and applauses of a nation were sounding in her ears and now she was come to this we crossed the mer de glace in safety but we had misgivings the crevices in the ice yawned deep and blue and mysterious and it made one nervous to traverse them the huge round waves of ice were slippery and difficult to climb and the chances of tripping and sliding down them and darting into a crevice were too many to be comfortable in the bottom of a deep swale between two of the biggest of the ice waves we found a fraud who pretended to be cutting steps to insure the safety of tourists he was soldiering when we came upon him but he hopped up and chipped out a couple of steps about big enough for a cat and charged us a franc or two for it then he sat down again to doze till the next party should come along he had collected blackmail from two or three hundred people already that day but had not chipped out ice enough to impair the glacier perceptibly i have heard of a good many soft sinecures but it seems to me that keeping toll bridge on a glacier is the softest one i have encountered yet that was a blazing hot day and it brought a persistent and persecuting thirst with it what an unspeakable luxury it was to slake that thirst with the pure and limpid ice water of the glacier down the sides of every great rib of pure ice poured limpid rills in gutters carved by their own attrition better still wherever a rock had lain there was now a bowl shaped hole with smooth white sides and bottom of ice and this bowl was brimming with water of such absolute clearness that the careless observer would not see it at all but would think the bowl was empty these fountains had such an alluring look that i often stretched myself out when i was not thirsty and dipped my face in and drank till my teeth ached everywhere among the swiss mountains we had at hand the blessing not to be found in europe except in the mountains of water capable of quenching thirst everywhere in the swiss highlands brilliant little rills of exquisitely cold water went dancing along by the roadsides and my comrade and i were always drinking and always delivering our deep gratitude but in europe everywhere except in the mountains the water is flat and insipid beyond the power of words to describe it is served lukewarm but no matter ice could not help it it is incurably flat incurably insipid it is only good to wash with i wonder it doesnt occur to the average inhabitant to try it for that in europe the people say contemptuously nobody drinks water here indeed they have a sound and sufficient reason in many places they even have what may be called prohibitory reasons in paris and munich for instance they say dont drink the water it is simply poison either america is healthier than europe notwithstanding her deadly indulgence in ice water or she does not keep the run of her death rate as sharply as europe does i think we do keep up the death statistics accurately and if we do our cities are healthier than the cities of europe every month the german government tabulates the death rate of the world and publishes it i scrap booked these reports during several months and it was curious to see how regular and persistently each city repeated its same death rate month after month the tables might as well have been stereotyped they varied so little these tables were based upon weekly reports showing the average of deaths in each population for a year munich was always present with her deaths in each of her population yearly average chicago was as constant with her or dublin with her and so on only a few american cities appear in these tables but they are scattered so widely over the country that they furnish a good general average of city health in the united states and i think it will be granted that our towns and villages are healthier than our cities here is the average of the only american cities reported in the german tables chicago deaths in population annually philadelphia st louis san francisco new york the dublin of america see how the figures jump up as soon as one arrives at the transatlantic list paris glasgow london vienna augsburg braunschweigk nigsberg cologne dresden hamburg berlin bombay warsaw breslau odessa munich strasburg pesth cassel lisbon liverpool prague madras bucharest st petersburg trieste alexandria egypt dublin calcutta edinburgh is as healthy as new york but there is no city in the entire list which is healthier except frankfort on the main but frankfort is not as healthy as chicago san francisco st louis or philadelphia perhaps a strict average of the world might develop the fact that where one in of americas population dies two in of the other populations of the earth succumb i do not like to make insinuations but i do think the above statistics darkly suggest that these people over here drink this detestable water on the sly we climbed the moraine on the opposite side of the glacier and then crept along its sharp ridge a hundred yards or so in pretty constant danger of a tumble to the glacier below the fall would have been only one hundred feet but it would have closed me out as effectually as one thousand therefore i respected the distance accordingly and was glad when the trip was done a moraine is an ugly thing to assault head first at a distance it looks like an endless grave of fine sand accurately shaped and nicely smoothed but close by it is found to be made mainly of rough boulders of all sizes from that of a mans head to that of a cottage by and by we came to the mauvais pas or the villainous road to translate it feelingly it was a breakneck path around the face of a precipice forty or fifty feet high and nothing to hang on to but some iron railings i got along slowly safely and uncomfortably and finally reached the middle my hopes began to rise a little but they were quickly blighted for there i met a hog a long nosed bristly fellow that held up his snout and worked his nostrils at me inquiringly a hog on a pleasure excursion in switzerland think of it it is striking and unusual a body might write a poem about it he could not retreat if he had been disposed to do it it would have been foolish to stand upon our dignity in a place where there was hardly room to stand upon our feet so we did nothing of the sort there were twenty or thirty ladies and gentlemen behind us we all turned about and went back and the hog followed behind the creature did not seem set up by what he had done he had probably done it before we reached the restaurant on the height called the chapeau at four in the afternoon it was a memento factory and the stock was large cheap and varied i bought the usual paper cutter to remember the place by and had mont blanc the mauvais pas and the rest of the region branded on my alpenstock then we descended to the valley and walked home without being tied together this was not dangerous for the valley was five miles wide and quite level we reached the hotel before nine o clock next morning we left for geneva on top of the diligence under shelter of a gay awning if i remember rightly there were more than twenty people up there it was so high that the ascent was made by ladder the huge vehicle was full everywhere inside and out five other diligences left at the same time all full we had engaged our seats two days beforehand to make sure and paid the regulation price five dollars each but the rest of the company were wiser they had trusted baedeker and waited consequently some of them got their seats for one or two dollars baedeker knows all about hotels railway and diligence companies and speaks his mind freely he is a trustworthy friend of the traveler we never saw mont blanc at his best until we were many miles away then he lifted his majestic proportions high into the heavens all white and cold and solemn and made the rest of the world seem little and plebeian and cheap and trivial as he passed out of sight at last an old englishman settled himself in his seat and said well i am satisfied i have seen the principal features of swiss scenery mont blanc and the goiter now for home chapter xlvii queer european manners we spent a few pleasant restful days at geneva that delightful city where accurate time pieces are made for all the rest of the world but whose own clocks never give the correct time of day by any accident geneva is filled with pretty shops and the shops are filled with the most enticing gimcrackery but if one enters one of these places he is at once pounced upon and followed up and so persecuted to buy this that and the other thing that he is very grateful to get out again and is not at all apt to repeat his experiment the shopkeepers of the smaller sort in geneva are as troublesome and persistent as are the salesmen of that monster hive in paris the grands magasins du louvre an establishment where ill mannered pestering pursuing and insistence have been reduced to a science in geneva prices in the smaller shops are very elastic that is another bad feature i was looking in at a window at a very pretty string of beads suitable for a child i was only admiring them i had no use for them i hardly ever wear beads the shopwoman came out and offered them to me for thirty five francs i said it was cheap but i did not need them ah but monsieur they are so beautiful i confessed it but said they were not suitable for one of my age and simplicity of character she darted in and brought them out and tried to force them into my hands saying ah but only see how lovely they are surely monsieur will take them monsieur shall have them for thirty francs there i have said it it is a loss but one must live i dropped my hands and tried to move her to respect my unprotected situation but no she dangled the beads in the sun before my face exclaiming ah monsieur cannot resist them she hung them on my coat button folded her hand resignedly and said gone and for thirty francs the lovely things it is incredible but the good god will sanctify the sacrifice to me i removed them gently returned them and walked away shaking my head and smiling a smile of silly embarrassment while the passers by halted to observe the woman leaned out of her door shook the beads and screamed after me monsieur shall have them for twenty eight i shook my head twenty seven it is a cruel loss it is ruin but take them only take them i still retreated still wagging my head mon dieu they shall even go for twenty six there i have said it come i wagged another negative a nurse and a little english girl had been near me and were following me now the shopwoman ran to the nurse thrust the beads into her hands and said monsieur shall have them for twenty five take them to the hotel he shall send me the money tomorrow next day when he likes then to the child when thy father sends me the money come thou also my angel and thou shall have something oh so pretty i was thus providentially saved the nurse refused the beads squarely and firmly and that ended the matter the sights of geneva are not numerous i made one attempt to hunt up the houses once inhabited by those two disagreeable people rousseau and calvin but i had no success then i concluded to go home i found it was easier to propose to do that than to do it for that town is a bewildering place i got lost in a tangle of narrow and crooked streets and stayed lost for an hour or two finally i found a street which looked somewhat familiar and said to myself now i am at home i judge but i was wrong this was hell street presently i found another place which had a familiar look and said to myself now i am at home sure it was another error this was purgatory street after a little i said now i ve got the right place anyway no this is paradise street im further from home than i was in the beginning those were queer names calvin was the author of them likely hell and purgatory fitted those two streets like a glove but the paradise appeared to be sarcastic i came out on the lake front at last and then i knew where i was i was walking along before the glittering jewelry shops when i saw a curious performance a lady passed by and a trim dandy lounged across the walk in such an apparently carefully timed way as to bring himself exactly in front of her when she got to him he made no offer to step out of the way he did not apologize he did not even notice her she had to stop still and let him lounge by i wondered if he had done that piece of brutality purposely he strolled to a chair and seated himself at a small table two or three other males were sitting at similar tables sipping sweetened water i waited presently a youth came by and this fellow got up and served him the same trick still it did not seem possible that any one could do such a thing deliberately to satisfy my curiosity i went around the block and sure enough as i approached at a good round speed he got up and lounged lazily across my path fouling my course exactly at the right moment to receive all my weight this proved that his previous performances had not been accidental but intentional i saw that dandys curious game played afterward in paris but not for amusement not with a motive of any sort indeed but simply from a selfish indifference to other peoples comfort and rights one does not see it as frequently in paris as he might expect to for there the law says in effect it is the business of the weak to get out of the way of the strong we fine a cabman if he runs over a citizen paris fines the citizen for being run over at least so everybody says but i saw something which caused me to doubt i saw a horseman run over an old woman one day the police arrested him and took him away that looked as if they meant to punish him it will not do for me to find merit in american manners for are they not the standing butt for the jests of critical and polished europe still i must venture to claim one little matter of superiority in our manners a lady may traverse our streets all day going and coming as she chooses and she will never be molested by any man but if a lady unattended walks abroad in the streets of london even at noonday she will be pretty likely to be accosted and insulted and not by drunken sailors but by men who carry the look and wear the dress of gentlemen it is maintained that these people are not gentlemen but are a lower sort disguised as gentlemen the case of colonel valentine baker obstructs that argument for a man cannot become an officer in the british army except he hold the rank of gentleman this person finding himself alone in a railway compartment with an unprotected girl but it is an atrocious story and doubtless the reader remembers it well enough london must have been more or less accustomed to bakers and the ways of bakers else london would have been offended and excited baker was imprisoned in a parlor and he could not have been more visited or more overwhelmed with attentions if he had committed six murders and then while the gallows was preparing got religion after the manner of the holy charles peace of saintly memory arkansaw it seems a little indelicate to be trumpeting forth our own superiorities and comparisons are always odious but still arkansaw would certainly have hanged baker i do not say she would have tried him first but she would have hanged him anyway even the most degraded woman can walk our streets unmolested her sex and her weakness being her sufficient protection she will encounter less polish than she would in the old world but she will run across enough humanity to make up for it the music of a donkey awoke us early in the morning and we rose up and made ready for a pretty formidable walk to italy but the road was so level that we took the train we lost a good deal of time by this but it was no matter we were not in a hurry we were four hours going to chamb ery the swiss trains go upward of three miles an hour in places but they are quite safe that aged french town of chamb ry was as quaint and crooked as heilbronn a drowsy reposeful quiet reigned in the back streets which made strolling through them very pleasant barring the almost unbearable heat of the sun in one of these streets which was eight feet wide gracefully curved and built up with small antiquated houses i saw three fat hogs lying asleep and a boy also asleep taking care of them from queer old fashioned windows along the curve projected boxes of bright flowers and over the edge of one of these boxes hung the head and shoulders of a cat asleep the five sleeping creatures were the only living things visible in that street there was not a sound absolute stillness prevailed it was sunday one is not used to such dreamy sundays on the continent in our part of the town it was different that night a regiment of brown and battered soldiers had arrived home from algiers and i judged they got thirsty on the way they sang and drank till dawn in the pleasant open air we left for turin at ten the next morning by a railway which was profusely decorated with tunnels we forgot to take a lantern along consequently we missed all the scenery our compartment was full a ponderous tow headed swiss woman who put on many fine lady airs but was evidently more used to washing linen than wearing it sat in a corner seat and put her legs across into the opposite one propping them intermediately with her up ended valise in the seat thus pirated sat two americans greatly incommoded by that womans majestic coffin clad feet one of them begged politely to remove them she opened her wide eyes and gave him a stare but answered nothing by and by he proferred his request again with great respectfulness she said in good english and in a deeply offended tone that she had paid her passage and was not going to be bullied out of her rights by ill bred foreigners even if she was alone and unprotected but i have rights also madam my ticket entitles me to a seat but you are occupying half of it i will not talk with you sir what right have you to speak to me i do not know you one would know you came from a land where there are no gentlemen no gentleman would treat a lady as you have treated me i come from a region where a lady would hardly give me the same provocation you have insulted me sir you have intimated that i am not a lady and i hope i am not one after the pattern of your country i beg that you will give yourself no alarm on that head madam but at the same time i must insist always respectfully that you let me have my seat here the fragile laundress burst into tears and sobs i never was so insulted before never never it is shameful it is brutal it is base to bully and abuse an unprotected lady who has lost the use of her limbs and cannot put her feet to the floor without agony good heavens madam why didnt you say that at first i offer a thousand pardons and i offer them most sincerely i did not know i could not know anything was the matter you are most welcome to the seat and would have been from the first if i had only known i am truly sorry it all happened i do assure you but he couldnt get a word of forgiveness out of her she simply sobbed and sniffed in a subdued but wholly unappeasable way for two long hours meantime crowding the man more than ever with her undertaker furniture and paying no sort of attention to his frequent and humble little efforts to do something for her comfort then the train halted at the italian line and she hopped up and marched out of the car with as firm a leg as any washerwoman of all her tribe and how sick i was to see how she had fooled me turin is a very fine city in the matter of roominess it transcends anything that was ever dreamed of before i fancy it sits in the midst of a vast dead level and one is obliged to imagine that land may be had for the asking and no taxes to pay so lavishly do they use it the streets are extravagantly wide the paved squares are prodigious the houses are huge and handsome and compacted into uniform blocks that stretch away as straight as an arrow into the distance the sidewalks are about as wide as ordinary european streets and are covered over with a double arcade supported on great stone piers or columns one walks from one end to the other of these spacious streets under shelter all the time and all his course is lined with the prettiest of shops and the most inviting dining houses there is a wide and lengthy court glittering with the most wickedly enticing shops which is roofed with glass high aloft overhead and paved with soft toned marbles laid in graceful figures and at night when the place is brilliant with gas and populous with a sauntering and chatting and laughing multitude of pleasure seekers it is a spectacle worth seeing everything is on a large scale the public buildings for instance and they are architecturally imposing too as well as large the big squares have big bronze monuments in them at the hotel they gave us rooms that were alarming for size and parlor to match it was well the weather required no fire in the parlor for i think one might as well have tried to warm a park the place would have a warm look though in any weather for the window curtains were of red silk damask and the walls were covered with the same fire hued goods so also were the four sofas and the brigade of chairs the furniture the ornaments the chandeliers the carpets were all new and bright and costly we did not need a parlor at all but they said it belonged to the two bedrooms and we might use it if we chose since it was to cost nothing we were not averse to using it of course turin must surely read a good deal for it has more book stores to the square rod than any other town i know of and it has its own share of military folk the italian officers uniforms are very much the most beautiful i have ever seen and as a general thing the men in them were as handsome as the clothes they were not large men but they had fine forms fine features rich olive complexions and lustrous black eyes for several weeks i had been culling all the information i could about italy from tourists the tourists were all agreed upon one thing one must expect to be cheated at every turn by the italians i took an evening walk in turin and presently came across a little punch and judy show in one of the great squares twelve or fifteen people constituted the audience this miniature theater was not much bigger than a mans coffin stood on end the upper part was open and displayed a tinseled parlor a good sized handkerchief would have answered for a drop curtain the footlights consisted of a couple of candle ends an inch long various manikins the size of dolls appeared on the stage and made long speeches at each other gesticulating a good deal and they generally had a fight before they got through they were worked by strings from above and the illusion was not perfect for one saw not only the strings but the brawny hand that manipulated them and the actors and actresses all talked in the same voice too the audience stood in front of the theater and seemed to enjoy the performance heartily when the play was done a youth in his shirt sleeves started around with a small copper saucer to make a collection i did not know how much to put in but thought i would be guided by my predecessors unluckily i only had two of these and they did not help me much because they did not put in anything i had no italian money so i put in a small swiss coin worth about ten cents the youth finished his collection trip and emptied the result on the stage he had some very animated talk with the concealed manager then he came working his way through the little crowd seeking me i thought i had a mind to slip away but concluded i wouldnt i would stand my ground and confront the villainy whatever it was the youth stood before me and held up that swiss coin sure enough and said something i did not understand him but i judged he was requiring italian money of me the crowd gathered close to listen i was irritated and said in english of course i know its swiss but you ll take that or none i havent any other he tried to put the coin in my hand and spoke again i drew my hand away and said no sir i know all about you people you cant play any of your fraudful tricks on me if there is a discount on that coin i am sorry but i am not going to make it good i noticed that some of the audience didnt pay you anything at all you let them go without a word but you come after me because you think im a stranger and will put up with an extortion rather than have a scene but you are mistaken this time you ll take that swiss money or none the youth stood there with the coin in his fingers nonplused and bewildered of course he had not understood a word an english speaking italian spoke up now and said you are misunderstanding the boy he does not mean any harm he did not suppose you gave him so much money purposely so he hurried back to return you the coin lest you might get away before you discovered your mistake take it and give him a penny that will make everything smooth again i probably blushed then for there was occasion through the interpreter i begged the boys pardon but i nobly refused to take back the ten cents i said i was accustomed to squandering large sums in that way it was the kind of person i was then i retired to make a note to the effect that in italy persons connected with the drama do not cheat the episode with the showman reminds me of a dark chapter in my history i once robbed an aged and blind beggar woman of four dollars in a church it happened this way when i was out with the innocents abroad the ship stopped in the russian port of odessa and i went ashore with others to view the town i got separated from the rest and wandered about alone until late in the afternoon when i entered a greek church to see what it was like when i was ready to leave i observed two wrinkled old women standing stiffly upright against the inner wall near the door with their brown palms open to receive alms i contributed to the nearer one and passed out i had gone fifty yards perhaps when it occurred to me that i must remain ashore all night as i had heard that the ships business would carry her away at four o clock and keep her away until morning it was a little after four now i had come ashore with only two pieces of money both about the same size but differing largely in value one was a french gold piece worth four dollars the other a turkish coin worth two cents and a half with a sudden and horrified misgiving i put my hand in my pocket now and sure enough i fetched out that turkish penny here was a situation a hotel would require pay in advance i must walk the street all night and perhaps be arrested as a suspicious character there was but one way out of the difficulty i flew back to the church and softly entered there stood the old woman yet and in the palm of the nearest one still lay my gold piece i was grateful i crept close feeling unspeakably mean i got my turkish penny ready and was extending a trembling hand to make the nefarious exchange when i heard a cough behind me i jumped back as if i had been accused and stood quaking while a worshiper entered and passed up the aisle i was there a year trying to steal that money that is it seemed a year though of course it must have been much less the worshipers went and came there were hardly ever three in the church at once but there was always one or more every time i tried to commit my crime somebody came in or somebody started out and i was prevented but at last my opportunity came for one moment there was nobody in the church but the two beggar women and me i whipped the gold piece out of the poor old paupers palm and dropped my turkish penny in its place poor old thing she murmured her thanks they smote me to the heart then i sped away in a guilty hurry and even when i was a mile from the church i was still glancing back every moment to see if i was being pursued that experience has been of priceless value and benefit to me for i resolved then that as long as i lived i would never again rob a blind beggar woman in a church and i have always kept my word the most permanent lessons in morals are those which come not of booky teaching but of experience chapter xlviii beauty of women and of old masters in milan we spent most of our time in the vast and beautiful arcade or gallery or whatever it is called blocks of tall new buildings of the most sumptuous sort rich with decoration and graced with statues the streets between these blocks roofed over with glass at a great height the pavements all of smooth and variegated marble arranged in tasteful patterns little tables all over these marble streets people sitting at them eating drinking or smoking crowds of other people strolling by such is the arcade i should like to live in it all the time the windows of the sumptuous restaurants stand open and one breakfasts there and enjoys the passing show we wandered all over the town enjoying whatever was going on in the streets we took one omnibus ride and as i did not speak italian and could not ask the price i held out some copper coins to the conductor and he took two then he went and got his tariff card and showed me that he had taken only the right sum so i made a note italian omnibus conductors do not cheat near the cathedral i saw another instance of probity an old man was peddling dolls and toy fans two small american children bought fans and one gave the old man a franc and three copper coins and both started away but they were called back and the franc and one of the coppers were restored to them hence it is plain that in italy parties connected with the drama and the omnibus and the toy interests do not cheat the stocks of goods in the shops were not extensive generally in the vestibule of what seemed to be a clothing store we saw eight or ten wooden dummies grouped together clothed in woolen business suits and each marked with its price one suit was marked forty five francs nine dollars harris stepped in and said he wanted a suit like that nothing easier the old merchant dragged in the dummy brushed him off with a broom stripped him and shipped the clothes to the hotel he said he did not keep two suits of the same kind in stock but manufactured a second when it was needed to reclothe the dummy in another quarter we found six italians engaged in a violent quarrel they danced fiercely about gesticulating with their heads their arms their legs their whole bodies they would rush forward occasionally with a sudden access of passion and shake their fists in each others very faces we lost half an hour there waiting to help cord up the dead but they finally embraced each other affectionately and the trouble was over the episode was interesting but we could not have afforded all the time to it if we had known nothing was going to come of it but a reconciliation note made in italy people who quarrel cheat the spectator we had another disappointment afterward we approached a deeply interested crowd and in the midst of it found a fellow wildly chattering and gesticulating over a box on the ground which was covered with a piece of old blanket every little while he would bend down and take hold of the edge of the blanket with the extreme tips of his fingertips as if to show there was no deception chattering away all the while but always just as i was expecting to see a wonder feat of legerdemain he would let go the blanket and rise to explain further however at last he uncovered the box and got out a spoon with a liquid in it and held it fair and frankly around for people to see that it was all right and he was taking no advantage his chatter became more excited than ever i supposed he was going to set fire to the liquid and swallow it so i was greatly wrought up and interested i got a cent ready in one hand and a florin in the other intending to give him the former if he survived and the latter if he killed himself for his loss would be my gain in a literary way and i was willing to pay a fair price for the item but this impostor ended his intensely moving performance by simply adding some powder to the liquid and polishing the spoon then he held it aloft and he could not have shown a wilder exultation if he had achieved an immortal miracle the crowd applauded in a gratified way and it seemed to me that history speaks the truth when it says these children of the south are easily entertained we spent an impressive hour in the noble cathedral where long shafts of tinted light were cleaving through the solemn dimness from the lofty windows and falling on a pillar here a picture there and a kneeling worshiper yonder the organ was muttering censers were swinging candles were glinting on the distant altar and robed priests were filing silently past them the scene was one to sweep all frivolous thoughts away and steep the soul in a holy calm a trim young american lady paused a yard or two from me fixed her eyes on the mellow sparks flecking the far off altar bent her head reverently a moment then straightened up kicked her train into the air with her heel caught it deftly in her hand and marched briskly out we visited the picture galleries and the other regulation sights of milan not because i wanted to write about them again but to see if i had learned anything in twelve years i afterward visited the great galleries of rome and florence for the same purpose i found i had learned one thing when i wrote about the old masters before i said the copies were better than the originals that was a mistake of large dimensions the old masters were still unpleasing to me but they were truly divine contrasted with the copies the copy is to the original as the pallid smart inane new wax work group is to the vigorous earnest dignified group of living men and women whom it professes to duplicate there is a mellow richness a subdued color in the old pictures which is to the eye what muffled and mellowed sound is to the ear that is the merit which is most loudly praised in the old picture and is the one which the copy most conspicuously lacks and which the copyist must not hope to compass it was generally conceded by the artists with whom i talked that that subdued splendor that mellow richness is imparted to the picture by age then why should we worship the old master for it who didnt impart it instead of worshiping old time who did perhaps the picture was a clanging bell until time muffled it and sweetened it in conversation with an artist in venice i asked what is it that people see in the old masters i have been in the doges palace and i saw several acres of very bad drawing very bad perspective and very incorrect proportions paul veroneses dogs to not resemble dogs all the horses look like bladders on legs one man had a right leg on the left side of his body in the large picture where the emperor barbarossa is prostrate before the pope there are three men in the foreground who are over thirty feet high if one may judge by the size of a kneeling little boy in the center of the foreground and according to the same scale the pope is seven feet high and the doge is a shriveled dwarf of four feet the artist said yes the old masters often drew badly they did not care much for truth and exactness in minor details but after all in spite of bad drawing bad perspective bad proportions and a choice of subjects which no longer appeal to people as strongly as they did three hundred years ago there is a something about their pictures which is divine a something which is above and beyond the art of any epoch since a something which would be the despair of artists but that they never hope or expect to attain it and therefore do not worry about it that is what he said and he said what he believed and not only believed but felt reasoning especially reasoning without technical knowledge must be put aside in cases of this kind it cannot assist the inquirer it will lead him in the most logical progression to what in the eyes of artists would be a most illogical conclusion thus bad drawing bad proportion bad perspective indifference to truthful detail color which gets its merit from time and not from the artist these things constitute the old master conclusion the old master was a bad painter the old master was not an old master at all but an old apprentice your friend the artist will grant your premises but deny your conclusion he will maintain that notwithstanding this formidable list of confessed defects there is still a something that is divine and unapproachable about the old master and that there is no arguing the fact away by any system of reasoning whatsoever i can believe that there are women who have an indefinable charm in their faces which makes them beautiful to their intimates but a cold stranger who tried to reason the matter out and find this beauty would fail he would say of one of these women this chin is too short this nose is too long this forehead is too high this hair is too red this complexion is too pallid the perspective of the entire composition is incorrect conclusion the woman is not beautiful but her nearest friend might say and say truly your premises are right your logic is faultless but your conclusion is wrong nevertheless she is an old master she is beautiful but only to such as know her it is a beauty which cannot be formulated but it is there just the same i found more pleasure in contemplating the old masters this time than i did when i was in europe in former years but still it was a calm pleasure there was nothing overheated about it when i was in venice before i think i found no picture which stirred me much but this time there were two which enticed me to the doges palace day after day and kept me there hours at a time one of these was tintorettos three acre picture in the great council chamber when i saw it twelve years ago i was not strongly attracted to it the guide told me it was an insurrection in heaven but this was an error the movement of this great work is very fine there are ten thousand figures and they are all doing something there is a wonderful go to the whole composition some of the figures are driving headlong downward with clasped hands others are swimming through the cloud shoals some on their faces some on their backs great processions of bishops martyrs and angels are pouring swiftly centerward from various outlying directions everywhere is enthusiastic joy there is rushing movement everywhere there are fifteen or twenty figures scattered here and there with books but they cannot keep their attention on their reading they offer the books to others but no one wishes to read now the lion of st mark is there with his book st mark is there with his pen uplifted he and the lion are looking each other earnestly in the face disputing about the way to spell a word the lion looks up in rapt admiration while st mark spells this is wonderfully interpreted by the artist it is the master stroke of this imcomparable painting i visited the place daily and never grew tired of looking at that grand picture as i have intimated the movement is almost unimaginably vigorous the figures are singing hosannahing and many are blowing trumpets so vividly is noise suggested that spectators who become absorbed in the picture almost always fall to shouting comments in each others ears making ear trumpets of their curved hands fearing they may not otherwise be heard one often sees a tourist with the eloquent tears pouring down his cheeks funnel his hands at his wifes ear and hears him roar through them oh to be there and at rest none but the supremely great in art can produce effects like these with the silent brush twelve years ago i could not have appreciated this picture one year ago i could not have appreciated it my study of art in heidelberg has been a noble education to me all that i am today in art i owe to that the other great work which fascinated me was bassanos immortal hair trunk this is in the chamber of the council of ten it is in one of the three forty foot pictures which decorate the walls of the room the composition of this picture is beyond praise the hair trunk is not hurled at the strangers head so to speak as the chief feature of an immortal work so often is no it is carefully guarded from prominence it is subordinated it is restrained it is most deftly and cleverly held in reserve it is most cautiously and ingeniously led up to by the master and consequently when the spectator reaches it at last he is taken unawares he is unprepared and it bursts upon him with a stupefying surprise one is lost in wonder at all the thought and care which this elaborate planning must have cost a general glance at the picture could never suggest that there was a hair trunk in it the hair trunk is not mentioned in the title even which is pope alexander iii and the doge ziani the conqueror of the emperor frederick barbarossa you see the title is actually utilized to help divert attention from the trunk thus as i say nothing suggests the presence of the trunk by any hint yet everything studiedly leads up to it step by step let us examine into this and observe the exquisitely artful artlessness of the plan at the extreme left end of the picture are a couple of women one of them with a child looking over her shoulder at a wounded man sitting with bandaged head on the ground these people seem needless but no they are there for a purpose one cannot look at them without seeing the gorgeous procession of grandees bishops halberdiers and banner bearers which is passing along behind them one cannot see the procession without feeling the curiosity to follow it and learn whither it is going it leads him to the pope in the center of the picture who is talking with the bonnetless doge talking tranquilly too although within twelve feet of them a man is beating a drum and not far from the drummer two persons are blowing horns and many horsemen are plunging and rioting about indeed twenty two feet of this great work is all a deep and happy holiday serenity and sunday school procession and then we come suddenly upon eleven and one half feet of turmoil and racket and insubordination this latter state of things is not an accident it has its purpose but for it one would linger upon the pope and the doge thinking them to be the motive and supreme feature of the picture whereas one is drawn along almost unconsciously to see what the trouble is about now at the very end of this riot within four feet of the end of the picture and full thirty six feet from the beginning of it the hair trunk bursts with an electrifying suddenness upon the spectator in all its matchless perfection and the great masters triumph is sweeping and complete from that moment no other thing in those forty feet of canvas has any charm one sees the hair trunk and the hair trunk only and to see it is to worship it bassano even placed objects in the immediate vicinity of the supreme feature whose pretended purpose was to divert attention from it yet a little longer and thus delay and augment the surprise for instance to the right of it he has placed a stooping man with a cap so red that it is sure to hold the eye for a moment to the left of it some six feet away he has placed a red coated man on an inflated horse and that coat plucks your eye to that locality the next moment then between the trunk and the red horseman he has intruded a man naked to his waist who is carrying a fancy flour sack on the middle of his back instead of on his shoulder this admirable feat interests you of course keeps you at bay a little longer like a sock or a jacket thrown to the pursuing wolf but at last in spite of all distractions and detentions the eye of even the most dull and heedless spectator is sure to fall upon the worlds masterpiece and in that moment he totters to his chair or leans upon his guide for support descriptions of such a work as this must necessarily be imperfect yet they are of value the top of the trunk is arched the arch is a perfect half circle in the roman style of architecture for in the then rapid decadence of greek art the rising influence of rome was already beginning to be felt in the art of the republic the trunk is bound or bordered with leather all around where the lid joins the main body many critics consider this leather too cold in tone but i consider this its highest merit since it was evidently made so to emphasize by contrast the impassioned fervor of the hasp the highlights in this part of the work are cleverly managed the motif is admirably subordinated to the ground tints and the technique is very fine the brass nail heads are in the purest style of the early renaissance the strokes here are very firm and bold every nail head is a portrait the handle on the end of the trunk has evidently been retouched i think with a piece of chalk but one can still see the inspiration of the old master in the tranquil almost too tranquil hang of it the hair of this trunk is real hair so to speak white in patches brown in patches the details are finely worked out the repose proper to hair in a recumbent and inactive attitude is charmingly expressed there is a feeling about this part of the work which lifts it to the highest altitudes of art the sense of sordid realism vanishes away one recognizes that there is soul here view this trunk as you will it is a gem it is a marvel it is a miracle some of the effects are very daring approaching even to the boldest flights of the rococo the sirocco and the byzantine schools yet the masters hand never falters it moves on calm majestic confident and with that art which conceals art it finally casts over the tout ensemble by mysterious methods of its own a subtle something which refines subdues etherealizes the arid components and endures them with the deep charm and gracious witchery of poesy among the art treasures of europe there are pictures which approach the hair trunk there are two which may be said to equal it possibly but there is none that surpasses it so perfect is the hair trunk that it moves even persons who ordinarily have no feeling for art when an erie baggagemaster saw it two years ago he could hardly keep from checking it and once when a customs inspector was brought into its presence he gazed upon it in silent rapture for some moments then slowly and unconsciously placed one hand behind him with the palm uppermost and got out his chalk with the other these facts speak for themselves chapter xlix hanged with a golden rope one lingers about the cathedral a good deal in venice there is a strong fascination about it partly because it is so old and partly because it is so ugly too many of the worlds famous buildings fail of one chief virtue harmony they are made up of a methodless mixture of the ugly and the beautiful this is bad it is confusing it is unrestful one has a sense of uneasiness of distress without knowing why but one is calm before st marks one is calm within it one would be calm on top of it calm in the cellar for its details are masterfully ugly no misplaced and impertinent beauties are intruded anywhere and the consequent result is a grand harmonious whole of soothing entrancing tranquilizing soul satisfying ugliness ones admiration of a perfect thing always grows never declines and this is the surest evidence to him that it is perfect st marks is perfect to me it soon grew to be so nobly so augustly ugly that it was difficult to stay away from it even for a little while every time its squat domes disappeared from my view i had a despondent feeling whenever they reappeared i felt an honest rapture i have not known any happier hours than those i daily spent in front of florians looking across the great square at it propped on its long row of low thick legged columns its back knobbed with domes it seemed like a vast warty bug taking a meditative walk st marks is not the oldest building in the world of course but it seems the oldest and looks the oldest especially inside when the ancient mosaics in its walls become damaged they are repaired but not altered the grotesque old pattern is preserved antiquity has a charm of its own and to smarten it up would only damage it one day i was sitting on a red marble bench in the vestibule looking up at an ancient piece of apprentice work in mosaic illustrative of the command to multiply and replenish the earth the cathedral itself had seemed very old but this picture was illustrating a period in history which made the building seem young by comparison but i presently found an antique which was older than either the battered cathedral or the date assigned to the piece of history it was a spiral shaped fossil as large as the crown of a hat it was embedded in the marble bench and had been sat upon by tourists until it was worn smooth contrasted with the inconceivable antiquity of this modest fossil those other things were flippantly modern jejune mere matters of day before yesterday the sense of the oldness of the cathedral vanished away under the influence of this truly venerable presence st marks is monumental it is an imperishable remembrancer of the profound and simple piety of the middle ages whoever could ravish a column from a pagan temple did it and contributed his swag to this christian one so this fane is upheld by several hundred acquisitions procured in that peculiar way in our day it would be immoral to go on the highway to get bricks for a church but it was no sin in the old times st marks was itself the victim of a curious robbery once the thing is set down in the history of venice but it might be smuggled into the arabian nights and not seem out of place there nearly four hundred and fifty years ago a candian named stammato in the suite of a prince of the house of este was allowed to view the riches of st marks his sinful eye was dazzled and he hid himself behind an altar with an evil purpose in his heart but a priest discovered him and turned him out afterward he got in again by false keys this time he went there night after night and worked hard and patiently all alone overcoming difficulty after difficulty with his toil and at last succeeded in removing a great brick of the marble paneling which walled the lower part of the treasury this block he fixed so that he could take it out and put it in at will after that for weeks he spent all his midnights in his magnificent mine inspecting it in security gloating over its marvels at his leisure and always slipping back to his obscure lodgings before dawn with a dukes ransom under his cloak he did not need to grab haphazard and run there was no hurry he could make deliberate and well considered selections he could consult his esthetic tastes one comprehends how undisturbed he was and how safe from any danger of interruption when it is stated that he even carried off a unicorns horn a mere curiosity which would not pass through the egress entire but had to be sawn in two a bit of work which cost him hours of tedious labor he continued to store up his treasures at home until his occupation lost the charm of novelty and became monotonous then he ceased from it contented well he might be for his collection raised to modern values represented nearly fifty million dollars he could have gone home much the richest citizen of his country and it might have been years before the plunder was missed but he was human he could not enjoy his delight alone he must have somebody to talk about it with so he exacted a solemn oath from a candian noble named crioni then led him to his lodgings and nearly took his breath away with a sight of his glittering hoard he detected a look in his friends face which excited his suspicion and was about to slip a stiletto into him when crioni saved himself by explaining that that look was only an expression of supreme and happy astonishment stammato made crioni a present of one of the states principal jewels a huge carbuncle which afterward figured in the ducal cap of state and the pair parted crioni went at once to the palace denounced the criminal and handed over the carbuncle as evidence stammato was arrested tried and condemned with the old time venetian promptness he was hanged between the two great columns in the piazza with a gilded rope out of compliment to his love of gold perhaps he got no good of his booty at all it was all recovered in venice we had a luxury which very seldom fell to our lot on the continent a home dinner with a private family if one could always stop with private families when traveling europe would have a charm which it now lacks as it is one must live in the hotels of course and that is a sorrowful business a man accustomed to american food and american domestic cookery would not starve to death suddenly in europe but i think he would gradually waste away and eventually die he would have to do without his accustomed morning meal that is too formidable a change altogether he would necessarily suffer from it he could get the shadow the sham the base counterfeit of that meal but it would do him no good and money could not buy the reality to particularize the average americans simplest and commonest form of breakfast consists of coffee and beefsteak well in europe coffee is an unknown beverage you can get what the european hotel keeper thinks is coffee but it resembles the real thing as hypocrisy resembles holiness it is a feeble characterless uninspiring sort of stuff and almost as undrinkable as if it had been made in an american hotel the milk used for it is what the french call christian milk milk which has been baptized after a few months acquaintance with european coffee ones mind weakens and his faith with it and he begins to wonder if the rich beverage of home with its clotted layer of yellow cream on top of it is not a mere dream after all and a thing which never existed next comes the european bread fair enough good enough after a fashion but cold cold and tough and unsympathetic and never any change never any variety always the same tiresome thing next the butter the sham and tasteless butter no salt in it and made of goodness knows what then there is the beefsteak they have it in europe but they dont know how to cook it neither will they cut it right it comes on the table in a small round pewter platter it lies in the center of this platter in a bordering bed of grease soaked potatoes it is the size shape and thickness of a mans hand with the thumb and fingers cut off it is a little overdone is rather dry it tastes pretty insipidly it rouses no enthusiasm imagine a poor exile contemplating that inert thing and imagine an angel suddenly sweeping down out of a better land and setting before him a mighty porterhouse steak an inch and a half thick hot and sputtering from the griddle dusted with a fragrant pepper enriched with little melting bits of butter of the most unimpeachable freshness and genuineness the precious juices of the meat trickling out and joining the gravy archipelagoed with mushrooms a township or two of tender yellowish fat gracing an outlying district of this ample county of beefsteak the long white bone which divides the sirloin from the tenderloin still in its place and imagine that the angel also adds a great cup of american home made coffee with a cream a froth on top some real butter firm and yellow and fresh some smoking hot biscuits a plate of hot buckwheat cakes with transparent syrup could words describe the gratitude of this exile the european dinner is better than the european breakfast but it has its faults and inferiorities it does not satisfy he comes to the table eager and hungry he swallows his soup there is an undefinable lack about it somewhere thinks the fish is going to be the thing he wants eats it and isnt sure thinks the next dish is perhaps the one that will hit the hungry place tries it and is conscious that there was a something wanting about it also and thus he goes on from dish to dish like a boy after a butterfly which just misses getting caught every time it alights but somehow doesnt get caught after all and at the end the exile and the boy have fared about alike the one is full but grievously unsatisfied the other has had plenty of exercise plenty of interest and a fine lot of hopes but he hasnt got any butterfly there is here and there an american who will say he can remember rising from a european table dh te perfectly satisfied but we must not overlook the fact that there is also here and there an american who will lie the number of dishes is sufficient but then it is such a monotonous variety of unstriking dishes it is an inane dead level of fair to middling there is nothing to accent it perhaps if the roast of mutton or of beef a big generous one were brought on the table and carved in full view of the client that might give the right sense of earnestness and reality to the thing but they dont do that they pass the sliced meat around on a dish and so you are perfectly calm it does not stir you in the least now a vast roast turkey stretched on the broad of his back with his heels in the air and the rich juices oozing from his fat sides but i may as well stop there for they would not know how to cook him they cant even cook a chicken respectably and as for carving it they do that with a hatchet this is about the customary table dh te bill in summer soup characterless fish sole salmon or whiting usually tolerably good roast mutton or beef tasteless and some last years potatoes a pate or some other made dish usually good considering one vegetable brought on in state and all alone usually insipid lentils or string beans or indifferent asparagus roast chicken as tasteless as paper lettuce salad tolerably good decayed strawberries or cherries sometimes the apricots and figs are fresh but this is no advantage as these fruits are of no account anyway the grapes are generally good and sometimes there is a tolerably good peach by mistake the variations of the above bill are trifling after a fortnight one discovers that the variations are only apparent not real in the third week you get what you had the first and in the fourth the week you get what you had the second three or four months of this weary sameness will kill the robustest appetite it has now been many months at the present writing since i

dispiriting presence of the squalid table dh te foreigners cannot enjoy our food i suppose any more than we can enjoy theirs it is not strange for tastes are made not born i might glorify my bill of

over excitement to carve fowls in the german fashion use a club and avoid the joints chapter l titian bad and titian good i wonder why some things are for instance art is allowed as much indecent license today as in earlier times but the privileges of literature in this respect have been sharply curtailed within the past eighty or ninety years fielding and smollett could portray the beastliness of their day in the beastliest language we have plenty of foul subjects to deal with in our day but we are not allowed to approach them very near even with nice and guarded forms of speech but not so with art the brush may still deal freely with any subject however revolting or indelicate it makes a body ooze sarcasm at every pore to go about rome and florence and see what this last generation has been doing with the statues these works which had stood in innocent nakedness for ages are all fig leaved now yes every one of them nobody noticed their nakedness before perhaps nobody can help noticing it now the fig leaf makes it so conspicuous but the comical thing about it all is that the fig leaf is confined to cold and pallid marble which would be still cold and unsuggestive without this sham and ostentatious symbol of modesty whereas warm blood paintings which do really need it have in no case been furnished with it at the door of the uffizzi in florence one is confronted by statues of a man and a woman noseless battered black with accumulated grime they hardly suggest human beings yet these ridiculous creatures have been thoughtfully and conscientiously fig leaved by this fastidious generation you enter and proceed to that most visited little gallery that exists in the world the tribune and there against the wall without obstructing rag or leaf you may look your fill upon the foulest the vilest the obscenest picture the world possesses titians venus it isnt that she is naked and stretched out on a bed no it is the attitude of one of her arms and hand if i ventured to describe that attitude there would be a fine howl but there the venus lies for anybody to gloat over that wants to and there she has a right to lie for she is a work of art and art has its privileges i saw young girls stealing furtive glances at her i saw young men gaze long and absorbedly at her i saw aged infirm men hang upon her charms with a pathetic interest how i should like to describe her just to see what a holy indignation i could stir up in the world just to hear the unreflecting average man deliver himself about my grossness and coarseness and all that the world says that no worded description of a moving spectacle is a hundredth part as moving as the same spectacle seen with ones own eyes yet the world is willing to let its son and its daughter and itself look at titians beast but wont stand a description of it in words which shows that the world is not as consistent as it might be there are pictures of nude women which suggest no impure thought i am well aware of that i am not railing at such what i am trying to emphasize is the fact that titians venus is very far from being one of that sort without any question it was painted for a bagnio and it was probably refused because it was a trifle too strong in truth it is too strong for any place but a public art gallery titian has two venuses in the tribune persons who have seen them will easily remember which one i am referring to in every gallery in europe there are hideous pictures of blood carnage oozing brains putrefaction pictures portraying intolerable suffering pictures alive with every conceivable horror wrought out in dreadful detail and similar pictures are being put on the canvas every day and publicly exhibited without a growl from anybody for they are innocent they are inoffensive being works of art but suppose a literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate description of one of these grisly things the critics would skin him alive well let it go it cannot be helped art retains her privileges literature has lost hers somebody else may cipher out the whys and the wherefores and the consistencies of it i havent got time titians venus defiles and disgraces the tribune there is no softening that fact but his moses glorifies it the simple truthfulness of its noble work wins the heart and the applause of every visitor be he learned or ignorant after wearying ones self with the acres of stuffy sappy expressionless babies that populate the canvases of the old masters of italy it is refreshing to stand before this peerless child and feel that thrill which tells you you are at last in the presence of the real thing this is a human child this is genuine you have seen him a thousand times you have seen him just as he is here and you confess without reserve that titian was a master the doll faces of other painted babes may mean one thing they may mean another but with the moses the case is different the most famous of all the art critics has said there is no room for doubt here plainly this child is in trouble i consider that the moses has no equal among the works of the old masters except it be the divine hair trunk of bassano i feel sure that if all the other old masters were lost and only these two preserved the world would be the gainer by it my sole purpose in going to florence was to see this immortal moses and by good fortune i was just in time for they were already preparing to remove it to a more private and better protected place because a fashion of robbing the great galleries was prevailing in europe at the time i got a capable artist to copy the picture pannemaker the engraver of dors books engraved it for me and i have the pleasure of laying it before the reader in this volume we took a turn to rome and some other italian cities then to munich and thence to paris partly for exercise but mainly because these things were in our projected program and it was only right that we should be faithful to it from paris i branched out and walked through holland and belgium procuring an occasional lift by rail or canal when tired and i had a tolerably good time of it by and large i worked spain and other regions through agents to save time and shoe leather we crossed to england and then made the homeward passage in the cunarder gallia a very fine ship i was glad to get home immeasurably glad so glad in fact that it did not seem possible that anything could ever get me out of the country again i had not enjoyed a pleasure abroad which seemed to me to compare with the pleasure i felt in seeing new york harbor again europe has many advantages which we have not but they do not compensate for a good many still more valuable ones which exist nowhere but in our own country then we are such a homeless lot when we are over there so are europeans themselves for that matter they live in dark and chilly vast tombs costly enough maybe but without conveniences to be condemned to live as the average european family lives would make life a pretty heavy burden to the average american family on the whole i think that short visits to europe are better for us than long ones the former preserve us from becoming europeanized they keep our pride of country intact and at the same time they intensify our affection for our country and our people whereas long visits have the effect of dulling those feelings at least in the majority of cases i think that one who mixes much with americans long resident abroad must arrive at this conclusion appendix nothing gives such weight and dignity to a book as an appendix herodotus appendix a the portier omar khay am the poet prophet of persia writing more than eight hundred years ago has said in the four parts of the earth are many that are able to write learned books many that are able to lead armies and many also that are able to govern kingdoms and empires but few there be that can keep a hotel a word about the european hotel portier he is a most admirable invention a most valuable convenience he always wears a conspicuous uniform he can always be found when he is wanted for he sticks closely to his post at the front door he is as polite as a duke he speaks from four to ten languages he is your surest help and refuge in time of trouble or perplexity he is not the clerk he is not the landlord he ranks above the clerk and represents the landlord who is seldom seen instead of going to the clerk for information as we do at home you go to the portier it is the pride of our average hotel clerk to know nothing whatever it is the pride of the portier to know everything you ask the portier at what hours the trains leave he tells you instantly or you ask him who is the best physician in town or what is the hack tariff or how many children the mayor has or what days the galleries are open and whether a permit is required and where you are to get it and what you must pay for it or when the theaters open and close what the plays are to be and the price of seats or what is the newest thing in hats or how the bills of mortality average or who struck billy patterson it does not matter what you ask him in nine cases out of ten he knows and in the tenth case he will find out for you before you can turn around three times there is nothing he will not put his hand to suppose you tell him you wish to go from hamburg to peking by the way of jericho and are ignorant of routes and prices the next morning he will hand you a piece of paper with the whole thing worked out on it to the last detail before you have been long on european soil you find yourself still saying you are relying on providence but when you come to look closer you will see that in reality you are relying on the portier he discovers what is puzzling you or what is troubling you or what your need is before you can get the half of it out and he promptly says leave that to me consequently you easily drift into the habit of leaving everything to him there is a certain embarrassment about applying to the average american hotel clerk a certain hesitancy a sense of insecurity against rebuff but you feel no embarrassment in your intercourse with the portier he receives your propositions with an enthusiasm which cheers and plunges into their accomplishment with an alacrity which almost inebriates the more requirements you can pile upon him the better he likes it of course the result is that you cease from doing anything for yourself he calls a hack when you want one puts you into it tells the driver whither to take you receives you like a long lost child when you return sends you about your business does all the quarreling with the hackman himself and pays him his money out of his own pocket he sends for your theater tickets and pays for them he sends for any possible article you can require be it a doctor an elephant or a postage stamp and when you leave at last you will find a subordinate seated with the cab driver who will put you in your railway compartment buy your tickets have your baggage weighed bring you the printed tags and tell you everything is in your bill and paid for at home you get such elaborate excellent and willing service as this only in the best hotels of our large cities but in europe you get it in the mere back country towns just as well what is the secret of the portiers devotion it is very simple he gets fees and no salary his fee is pretty closely regulated too if you stay a week you give him five marks a dollar and a quarter or about eighteen cents a day if you stay a month you reduce this average somewhat if you stay two or three months or longer you cut it down half or even more than half if you stay only one day you give the portier a mark the head waiters fee is a shade less than the portiers the boots who not only blacks your boots and brushes your clothes but is usually the porter and handles your baggage gets a somewhat smaller fee than the head waiter the chambermaids fee ranks below that of the boots you fee only these four and no one else a german gentleman told me that when he remained a week in a hotel he gave the portier five marks the head waiter four the boots three and the chambermaid two and if he stayed three months he divided ninety marks among them in about the above proportions ninety marks make none of these fees are ever paid until you leave the hotel though it be a year except one of these four servants should go away in the mean time in that case he will be sure to come and bid you good by and give you the opportunity to pay him what is fairly coming to him it is considered very bad policy to fee a servant while you are still to remain longer in the hotel because if you gave him too little he might neglect you afterward and if you gave him too much he might neglect somebody else to attend to you it is considered best to keep his expectations on a string until your stay is concluded i do not know whether hotel servants in new york get any wages or not but i do know that in some of the hotels there the feeing system in vogue is a heavy burden the waiter expects a quarter at breakfast and gets it you have a different waiter at luncheon and so he gets a quarter your waiter at dinner is another stranger consequently he gets a quarter the boy who carries your satchel to your room and lights your gas fumbles around and hangs around significantly and you fee him to get rid of him now you may ring for ice water and ten minutes later for a lemonade and ten minutes afterward for a cigar and by and by for a newspaper and what is the result why a new boy has appeared every time and fooled and fumbled around until you have paid him something suppose you boldly put your foot down and say it is the hotels business to pay its servants you will have to ring your bell ten or fifteen times before you get a servant there and when he goes off to fill your order you will grow old and infirm before you see him again you may struggle nobly for twenty four hours maybe if you are an adamantine sort of person but in the mean time you will have been so wretchedly served and so insolently that you will haul down your colors and go to impoverishing yourself with fees it seems to me that it would be a happy idea to import the european feeing system into america i believe it would result in getting even the bells of the philadelphia hotels answered and cheerful service rendered the greatest american hotels keep a number of clerks and a cashier and pay them salaries which mount up to a considerable total in the course of a year the great continental hotels keep a cashier on a trifling salary and a portier who pays the hotel a salary by the latter system both the hotel and the public save money and are better served than by our system one of our consuls told me that a portier of a great berlin hotel paid five thousand dollars a year for his position and yet cleared six thousand dollars for himself the position of portier in the chief hotels of saratoga long branch new york and similar centers of resort would be one which the holder could afford to pay even more than five thousand dollars for perhaps when we borrowed the feeing fashion from europe a dozen years ago the salary system ought to have been discontinued of course we might make this correction now i should think and we might add the portier too since i first began to study the portier i have had opportunities to observe him in the chief cities of germany switzerland and italy and the more i have seen of him the more i have wished that he might be adopted in america and become there as he is in europe the strangers guardian angel yes what was true eight hundred years ago is just as true today few there be that can keep a hotel perhaps it is because the landlords and their subordinates have in too many cases taken up their trade without first learning it in europe the trade of hotel keeper is taught the apprentice begins at the bottom of the ladder and masters the several grades one after the other just as in our country printing offices the apprentice first learns how to sweep out and bring water then learns to roll then to sort pi then to set type and finally rounds and completes his education with job work and press work so the landlord apprentice serves as call boy then as under waiter then as a parlor waiter then as head waiter in which position he often has to make out all the bills then as clerk or cashier then as portier his trade is learned now and by and by he will assume the style and dignity of landlord and be found conducting a hotel of his own now in europe the same as in america when a man has kept a hotel so thoroughly well during a number of years as to give it a great reputation he has his reward he can live prosperously on that reputation he can let his hotel run down to the last degree of shabbiness and yet have it full of people all the time for instance there is the hotel de ville in milan it swarms with mice and fleas and if the rest of the world were destroyed it could furnish dirt enough to start another one with the food would create an insurrection in a poorhouse and yet if you go outside to get your meals that hotel makes up its loss by overcharging you on all sorts of trifles and without making any denials or excuses about it either but the hotel de villes old excellent reputation still keeps its dreary rooms crowded with travelers who would be elsewhere if they had only some wise friend to warn them appendix b heidelberg castle heidelberg castle must have been very beautiful before the french battered and bruised and scorched it two hundred years ago the stone is brown with a pinkish tint and does not seem to stain easily the dainty and elaborate ornamentation upon its two chief fronts is as delicately carved as if it had been intended for the interior of a drawing room rather than for the outside of a house many fruit and flower clusters human heads and grim projecting lions heads are still as perfect in every detail as if they were new but the statues which are ranked between the windows have suffered these are life size statues of old time emperors electors and similar grandees clad in mail and bearing ponderous swords some have lost an arm some a head and one poor fellow is chopped off at the middle there is a saying that if a stranger will pass over the drawbridge and walk across the court to the castle front without saying anything he can make a wish and it will be fulfilled but they say that the truth of this thing has never had a chance to be proved for the reason that before any stranger can walk from the drawbridge to the appointed place the beauty of the palace front will extort an exclamation of delight from him a ruin must be rightly situated to be effective this one could not have been better placed it stands upon a commanding elevation it is buried in green woods there is no level ground about it but on the contrary there are wooded terraces upon terraces and one looks down through shining leaves into profound chasms and abysses where twilight reigns and the sun cannot intrude nature knows how to garnish a ruin to get the best effect one of these old towers is split down the middle and one half has tumbled aside it tumbled in such a way as to establish itself in a picturesque attitude then all it lacked was a fitting drapery and nature has furnished that she has robed the rugged mass in flowers and verdure and made it a charm to the eye the standing half exposes its arched and cavernous rooms to you like open toothless mouths there too the vines and flowers have done their work of grace the rear portion of the tower has not been neglected either but is clothed with a clinging garment of polished ivy which hides the wounds and stains of time even the top is not left bare but is crowned with a flourishing group of trees and shrubs misfortune has done for this old tower what it has done for the human character sometimes improved it a gentleman remarked one day that it might have been fine to live in the castle in the day of its prime but that we had one advantage which its vanished inhabitants lacked the advantage of having a charming ruin to visit and muse over but that was a hasty idea those people had the advantage of us they had the fine castle to live in and they could cross the rhine valley and muse over the stately ruin of trifels besides the trifels people in their day five hundred years ago could go and muse over majestic ruins that have vanished now to the last stone there have always been ruins no doubt and there have always been pensive people to sigh over them and asses to scratch upon them their names and the important date of their visit within a hundred years after adam left eden the guide probably gave the usual general flourish with his hand and said place where the animals were named ladies and gentlemen place where the tree of the forbidden fruit stood exact spot where adam and eve first met and here ladies and gentlemen adorned and hallowed by the names and addresses of three generations of tourists we have the crumbling remains of cains altar fine old ruin then no doubt he taxed them a shekel apiece and let them go an illumination of heidelberg castle is one of the sights of europe the castles picturesque shape its commanding situation midway up the steep and wooded mountainside its vast size these features combine to make an illumination a most effective spectacle it is necessarily an expensive show and consequently rather infrequent therefore whenever one of these exhibitions is to take place the news goes about in the papers and heidelberg is sure to be full of people on that night i and my agent had one of these opportunities and improved it about half past seven on the appointed evening we crossed the lower bridge with some american students in a pouring rain and started up the road which borders the neunheim side of the river this roadway was densely packed with carriages and foot passengers the former of all ages and the latter of all ages and both sexes this black and solid mass was struggling painfully onward through the slop the darkness and the deluge we waded along for three quarters of a mile and finally took up a position in an unsheltered beer garden directly opposite the castle we could not see the castle or anything else for that matter but we could dimly discern the outlines of the mountain over the way through the pervading blackness and knew whereabouts the castle was located we stood on one of the hundred benches in the garden under our umbrellas the other ninety nine were occupied by standing men and women and they also had umbrellas all the region round about and up and down the river road was a dense wilderness of humanity hidden under an unbroken pavement of carriage tops and umbrellas thus we stood during two drenching hours no rain fell on my head but the converging whalebone points of a dozen neighboring umbrellas poured little cooling steams of water down my neck and sometimes into my ears and thus kept me from getting hot and impatient i had the rheumatism too and had heard that this was good for it afterward however i was led to believe that the water treatment is not good for rheumatism there were even little girls in that dreadful place a man held one in his arms just in front of me for as much as an hour with umbrella drippings soaking into her clothing all the time in the circumstances two hours was a good while for us to have to wait but when the illumination did at last come we felt repaid it came unexpectedly of course things always do that have been long looked and longed for with a perfectly breath taking suddenness several mast sheaves of varicolored rockets were vomited skyward out of the black throats of the castle towers accompanied by a thundering crash of sound and instantly every detail of the prodigious ruin stood revealed against the mountainside and glowing with an almost intolerable splendor of fire and color for some little time the whole building was a blinding crimson mass the towers continued to spout thick columns of rockets aloft and overhead the sky was radiant with arrowy bolts which clove their way to the zenith paused curved gracefully downward then burst into brilliant fountain sprays of richly colored sparks the red fires died slowly down within the castle and presently the shell grew nearly black outside the angry glare that shone out through the broken arches and innumerable sashless windows now reproduced the aspect which the castle must have borne in the old time when the french spoilers saw the monster bonfire which they had made there fading and spoiling toward extinction while we still gazed and enjoyed the ruin was suddenly enveloped in rolling and rumbling volumes of vaporous green fire then in dazzling purple ones then a mixture of many colors followed then drowned the great fabric in its blended splendors meantime the nearest bridge had been illuminated and from several rafts anchored in the river meteor showers of rockets roman candles bombs serpents and catharine wheels were being discharged in wasteful profusion into the sky a marvelous sight indeed to a person as little used to such spectacles as i was for a while the whole region about us seemed as bright as day and yet the rain was falling in torrents all the time the evenings entertainment presently closed and we joined the innumerable caravan of half drowned strangers and waded home again the castle grounds are very ample and very beautiful and as they joined the hotel grounds with no fences to climb but only some nobly shaded stone stairways to descend we spent a part of nearly every day in idling through their smooth walks and leafy groves there was an attractive spot among the trees where were a great many wooden tables and benches and there one could sit in the shade and pretend to sip at his foamy beaker of beer while he inspected the crowd i say pretend because i only pretended to sip without really sipping that is the polite way but when you are ready to go you empty the beaker at a draught there was a brass band and it furnished excellent music every afternoon sometimes so many people came that every seat was occupied every table filled and never a rough in the assemblage all nicely dressed fathers and mothers young gentlemen and ladies and children and plenty of university students and glittering officers with here and there a gray professor or a peaceful old lady with her knitting and always a sprinkling of gawky foreigners everybody had his glass of beer before him or his cup of coffee or his bottle of wine or his hot cutlet and potatoes young ladies chatted or fanned themselves or wrought at their crocheting or embroidering the students fed sugar to their dogs or discussed duels or illustrated new fencing tricks with their little canes and everywhere was comfort and enjoyment and everywhere peace and good will to men the trees were jubilant with birds and the paths with rollicking children one could have a seat in that place and plenty of music any afternoon for about eight cents or a family ticket for the season for two dollars for a change when you wanted one you could stroll to the castle and burrow among its dungeons or climb about its ruined towers or visit its interior shows the great heidelberg tun for instance everybody has heard of the great heidelberg tun and most people have seen it no doubt it is a wine cask as big as a cottage and some traditions say it holds eighteen thousand bottles and other traditions say it holds eighteen hundred million barrels i think it likely that one of these statements is a mistake and the other is a lie however the mere matter of capacity is a thing of no sort of consequence since the cask is empty and indeed has always been empty history says an empty cask the size of a cathedral could excite but little emotion in me i do not see any wisdom in building a monster cask to hoard up emptiness in when you can get a better quality outside any day free of expense what could this cask have been built for the more one studies over that the more uncertain and unhappy he becomes some historians say that thirty couples some say thirty thousand couples can dance on the head of this cask at the same time even this does not seem to me to account for the building of it it does not even throw light on it a profound and scholarly englishman a specialist who had made the great heidelberg tun his sole study for fifteen years told me he had at last satisfied himself that the ancients built it to make german cream in he said that the average german cow yielded from one to two and half teaspoons of milk when she was not worked in the plow or the hay wagon more than eighteen or nineteen hours a day this milk was very sweet and good and a beautiful transparent bluish tint but in order to get cream from it in the most economical way a peculiar process was necessary now he believed that the habit of the ancients was to collect several milkings in a teacup pour it into the great tun fill up with water and then skim off the cream from time to time as the needs of the german empire demanded this began to look reasonable it certainly began to account for the german cream which i had encountered and marveled over in so many hotels and restaurants but a thought struck me why did not each ancient dairyman take his own teacup of milk and his own cask of water and mix them without making a government matter of it where could he get a cask large enough to contain the right proportion of water very true it was plain that the englishman had studied the matter from all sides still i thought i might catch him on one point so i asked him why the modern empire did not make the nations cream in the heidelberg tun instead of leaving it to rot away unused but he answered as one prepared a patient and diligent examination of the modern german cream had satisfied me that they do not use the great tun now because they have got a bigger one hid away somewhere either that is the case or they empty the spring milkings into the mountain torrents and then skim the rhine all summer there is a museum of antiquities in the castle and among its most treasured relics are ancient manuscripts connected with german history there are hundreds of these and their dates stretch back through many centuries one of them is a decree signed and sealed by the hand of a successor of charlemagne in the year a signature made by a hand which vanished out of this life near a thousand years ago is a more impressive thing than even a ruined castle luthers wedding ring was shown me also a fork belonging to a time anterior to our era and an early bootjack and there was a plaster cast of the head of a man who was assassinated about sixty years ago the stab wounds in the face were duplicated with unpleasant fidelity one or two real hairs still remained sticking in the eyebrows of the cast that trifle seemed to almost change the counterfeit into a corpse there are many aged portraits some valuable some worthless some of great interest some of none at all i bought a couple one a gorgeous duke of the olden time and the other a comely blue eyed damsel a princess maybe i bought them to start a portrait gallery of my ancestors with i paid a dollar and a half for the duke and a half for the princess one can lay in ancestors at even cheaper rates than these in europe if he will mouse among old picture shops and look out for chances appendix c the college prison it seems that the student may break a good many of the public laws without having to answer to the public authorities his case must come before the university for trial and punishment if a policeman catches him in an unlawful act and proceeds to arrest him the offender proclaims that he is a student and perhaps shows his matriculation card whereupon the officer asks for his address then goes his way and reports the matter at headquarters if the offense is one over which the city has no jurisdiction the authorities report the case officially to the university and give themselves no further concern about it the university court send for the student listen to the evidence and pronounce judgment the punishment usually inflicted is imprisonment in the university prison as i understand it a students case is often tried without his being present at all then something like this happens a constable in the service of the university visits the lodgings of the said student knocks is invited to come in does so and says politely if you please i am here to conduct you to prison ah says the student i was not expecting it what have i been doing two weeks ago the public peace had the honor to be disturbed by you it is true i had forgotten it very well i have been complained of tried and found guilty is that it exactly you are sentenced to two days solitary confinement in the college prison and i am sent to fetch you studento i cant go today officer if you please why student because i ve got an engagement officer tomorrow then perhaps student no i am going to the opera tomorrow officer could you come friday student reflectively let me see friday friday i dont seem to have anything on hand friday officer then if you please i will expect you on friday student all right i ll come around friday officer thank you good day sir student good day so on friday the student goes to the prison of his own accord and is admitted it is questionable if the worlds criminal history can show a custom more odd than this nobody knows now how it originated there have always been many noblemen among the students and it is presumed that all students are gentlemen in the old times it was usual to mar the convenience of such folk as little as possible perhaps this indulgent custom owes its origin to this one day i was listening to some conversation upon this subject when an american student said that for some time he had been under sentence for a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he would presently find an unoccupied day and betake himself to prison i asked the young gentleman to do me the kindness to go to jail as soon as he conveniently could so that i might try to get in there and visit him and see what college captivity was like he said he would appoint the very first day he could spare his confinement was to endure twenty four hours he shortly chose his day and sent me word i started immediately when i reached the university place i saw two gentlemen talking together and as they had portfolios under their arms i judged they were tutors or elderly students so i asked them in english to show me the college jail i had learned to take it for granted that anybody in germany who knows anything knows english so i had stopped afflicting people with my german these gentlemen seemed a trifle amused and a trifle confused too but one of them said he would walk around the corner with me and show me the place he asked me why i wanted to get in there and i said to see a friend and for curiosity he doubted if i would be admitted but volunteered to put in a word or two for me with the custodian he rang the bell a door opened and we stepped into a paved way and then up into a small living room where we were received by a hearty and good natured german woman of fifty she threw up her hands with a surprised ach gott herr professor and exhibited a mighty deference for my new acquaintance by the sparkle in her eye i judged she was a good deal amused too the herr professor talked to her in german and i understood enough of it to know that he was bringing very plausible reasons to bear for admitting me they were successful so the herr professor received my earnest thanks and departed the old dame got her keys took me up two or three flights of stairs unlocked a door and we stood in the presence of the criminal then she went into a jolly and eager description of all that had occurred downstairs and what the herr professor had said and so forth and so on plainly she regarded it as quite a superior joke that i had waylaid a professor and employed him in so odd a service but i wouldnt have done it if i had known he was a professor therefore my conscience was not disturbed now the dame left us to ourselves the cell was not a roomy one still it was a little larger than an ordinary prison cell it had a window of good size iron grated a small stove two wooden chairs two oaken tables very old and most elaborately carved with names mottoes faces armorial bearings etc the work of several generations of imprisoned students and a narrow wooden bedstead with a villainous straw mattress but no sheets pillows blankets or coverlets for these the student must furnish at his own cost if he wants them there was no carpet of course the ceiling was completely covered with names dates and monograms done with candle smoke the walls were thickly covered with pictures and portraits in profile some done with ink some with soot some with a pencil and some with red blue and green chalks and whenever an inch or two of space had remained between the pictures the captives had written plaintive verses or names and dates i do not think i was ever in a more elaborately frescoed apartment against the wall hung a placard containing the prison laws i made a note of one or two of these for instance the prisoner must pay for the privilege of entering a sum equivalent to cents of our money for the privilege of leaving when his term had expired cents for every day spent in the prison cents for fire and light cents a day the jailer furnishes coffee mornings for a small sum dinners and suppers may be ordered from outside if the prisoner chooses and he is allowed to pay for them too here and there on the walls appeared the names of american students and in one place the american arms and motto were displayed in colored chalks with the help of my friend i translated many of the inscriptions some of them were cheerful others the reverse i will give the reader a few specimens in my tenth semester my best one i am cast here through the complaints of others let those who follow me take warning iii tage ohne grund angeblich aus neugierde which is to say he had a curiosity to know what prison life was like so he made a breach in some law and got three days for it it is more than likely that he never had the same curiosity again translatione glinicke four days for being too eager a spectator of a row f graf bismarck ii which means that count bismarck son of the great statesman was a prisoner two days in translationr diergandt for love days many people in this world have caught it heavier than for the same indiscretion this one is terse i translate four weeks for misinterpreted gallantry i wish the sufferer had explained a little more fully a four week term is a rather serious matter there were many uncomplimentary references on the walls to a certain unpopular dignitary one sufferer had got three days for not saluting him another had here two days slept and three nights lain awake on account of this same drk in one place was a picture of drk hanging on a gallows here and there lonesome prisoners had eased the heavy time by altering the records left by predecessors leaving the name standing and the date and length of the captivity they had erased the description of the misdemeanor and written in its place in staring capitals for theft or for murder or some other gaudy crime in one place all by itself stood this blood curdling word rache revenge there was no name signed and no date it was an inscription well calculated to pique curiosity one would greatly like to know the nature of the wrong that had been done and what sort of vengeance was wanted and whether the prisoner ever achieved it or not but there was no way of finding out these things occasionally a name was followed simply by the remark ii days for disturbing the peace and without comment upon the justice or injustice of the sentence in one place was a hilarious picture of a student of the green cap corps with a bottle of champagne in each hand and below was the legend these make an evil fate endurable there were two prison cells and neither had space left on walls or ceiling for another name or portrait or picture the inside surfaces of the two doors were completely covered with cartes de visite of former prisoners ingeniously let into the wood and protected from dirt and injury by glass i very much wanted one of the sorry old tables which the prisoners had spent so many years in ornamenting with their pocket knives but red tape was in the way the custodian could not sell one without an order from a superior and that superior would have to get it from his superior and this one would have to get it from a higher one and so on up and up until the faculty should sit on the matter and deliver final judgment the system was right and nobody could find fault with it but it did not seem justifiable to bother so many people so i proceeded no further it might have cost me more than i could afford anyway for one of those prison tables which was at the time in a private museum in heidelberg was afterward sold at auction for two hundred and fifty dollars it was not worth more than a dollar or possibly a dollar and half before the captive students began their work on it persons who saw it at the auction said it was so curiously and wonderfully carved that it was worth the money that was paid for it among them many who have tasted the college prisons dreary hospitality was a lively young fellow from one of the southern states of america whose first years experience of german university life was rather peculiar the day he arrived in heidelberg he enrolled his name on the college books and was so elated with the fact that his dearest hope had found fruition and he was actually a student of the old and renowned university that he set to work that very night to celebrate the event by a grand lark in company with some other students in the course of his lark he managed to make a wide breach in one of the universitys most stringent laws sequel before noon next day he was in the college prison booked for three months the twelve long weeks dragged slowly by and the day of deliverance came at last a great crowd of sympathizing fellow students received him with a rousing demonstration as he came forth and of course there was another grand lark in the course of which he managed to make a wide breach of the citys most stringent laws sequel before noon next day he was safe in the city lockup booked for three months this second tedious captivity drew to an end in the course of time and again a great crowd of sympathizing fellow students gave him a rousing reception as he came forth but his delight in his freedom was so boundless that he could not proceed soberly and calmly but must go hopping and skipping and jumping down the sleety street from sheer excess of joy sequel he slipped and broke his leg and actually lay in the hospital during the next three months when he at last became a free man again he said he believed he would hunt up a brisker seat of learning the heidelberg lectures might be good but the opportunities of attending them were too rare the educational process too slow he said he had come to europe with the idea that the acquirement of an education was only a matter of time but if he had averaged the heidelberg system correctly it was rather a matter of eternity appendix d the awful german language a little learning makes the whole world kin proverbs xxxii i went often to look at the collection of curiosities in heidelberg castle and one day i surprised the keeper of it with my german i spoke entirely in that language he was greatly interested and after i had talked a while he said my german was very rare possibly a unique and wanted to add it to his museum if he had known what it had cost me to acquire my art he would also have known that it would break any collector to buy it harris and i had been hard at work on our german during several weeks at that time and although we had made good progress it had been accomplished under great difficulty and annoyance for three of our teachers had died in the mean time a person who has not studied german can form no idea of what a perplexing language it is surely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless and so slippery and elusive to the grasp one is washed about in it hither and thither in the most helpless way and when at last he thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech he turns over the page and reads let the pupil make careful note of the following exceptions he runs his eye down and finds that there are more exceptions to the rule than instances of it so overboard he goes again to hunt for another ararat and find another quicksand such has been and continues to be my experience every time i think i have got one of these four confusing cases where i am master of it a seemingly insignificant preposition intrudes itself into my sentence clothed with an awful and unsuspected power and crumbles the ground from under me for instance my book inquires after a certain bird it is always inquiring after things which are of no sort of consequence to anybody where is the bird now the answer to this question according to the book is that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of the rain of course no bird would do that but then you must stick to the book very well i begin to cipher out the german for that answer i begin at the wrong end necessarily for that is the german idea i say to myself regen rain is masculine or maybe it is feminine or possibly neuter it is too much trouble to look now therefore it is either der the regen or die the regen or das the regen according to which gender it may turn out to be when i look in the interest of science i will cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is masculine very well then the rain is der regen if it is simply in the quiescent state of being mentioned without enlargement or discussion nominative case but if this rain is lying around in a kind of a general way on the ground it is then definitely located it is doing something that is resting which is one of the german grammars ideas of doing something and this throws the rain into the dative case and makes it dem regen however this rain is not resting but is doing something actively it is falling to interfere with the bird likely and this indicates movement which has the effect of sliding it into the accusative case and changing dem regen into den regen having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter i answer up confidently and state in german that the bird is staying in the blacksmith shop wegen on account of den regen then the teacher lets me softly down with the remark that whenever the word wegen drops into a sentence it always throws that subject into the genitive case regardless of consequences and therefore this bird stayed in the blacksmith shop wegen des regens n b i was informed later by a higher authority that there was an exception which permits one to say wegen den regen in certain peculiar and complex circumstances but that this exception is not extended to anything but rain there are ten parts of speech and they are all troublesome an average sentence in a german newspaper is a sublime and impressive curiosity it occupies a quarter of a column it contains all the ten parts of speech not in regular order but mixed it is built mainly of compound words constructed by the writer on the spot and not to be found in any dictionary six or seven words compacted into one without joint or seam that is without hyphens it treats of fourteen or fifteen different subjects each enclosed in a parenthesis of its own with here and there extra parentheses making pens within pens finally all the parentheses and reparentheses are massed together between a couple of king parentheses one of which is placed in the first line of the majestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of it after which comes the verb and you find out for the first time what the man has been talking about and after the verb merely by way of ornament as far as i can make out the writer shovels in haben sind gewesen gehabt haven geworden sein or words to that effect and the monument is finished i suppose that this closing hurrah is in the nature of the flourish to a mans signature not necessary but pretty german books are easy enough to read when you hold them before the looking glass or stand on your head so as to reverse the construction but i think that to learn to read and understand a german newspaper is a thing which must always remain an impossibility to a foreigner yet even the german books are not entirely free from attacks of the parenthesis distemper though they are usually so mild as to cover only a few lines and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it carries some meaning to your mind because you are able to remember a good deal of what has gone before now here is a sentence from a popular and excellent german novel with a slight parenthesis in it i will make a perfectly literal translation and throw in the parenthesis marks and some hyphens for the assistance of the reader though in the original there are no parenthesis marks or hyphens and the reader is left to flounder through to the remote verb the best way he can but when he upon the street the in satin and silk covered now very unconstrained after the newest fashioned dressed government counselors wife met etc etc wenn er aber auf der strasse der in sammt und seide gehuellten jetz sehr ungenirt nach der neusten mode gekleideten regierungsrathin begegnet that is from the old mamselles secret by mrs marlitt and that sentence is constructed upon the most approved german model you observe how far that verb is from the readers base of operations well in a german newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page and i have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting preliminaries and parentheses for a column or two they get in a hurry and have to go to press without getting to the verb at all of course then the reader is left in a very exhausted and ignorant state we have the parenthesis disease in our literature too and one may see cases of it every day in our books and newspapers but with us it is the mark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect whereas with the germans it is doubtless the mark and sign of a practiced pen and of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog which stands for clearness among these people for surely it is not clearness it necessarily cant be clearness even a jury would have penetration enough to discover that a writers ideas must be a good deal confused a good deal out of line and sequence when he starts out to say that a man met a counselors wife in the street and then right in the midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching people and makes them stand still until he jots down an inventory of the womans dress that is manifestly absurd it reminds a person of those dentists who secure your instant and breathless interest in a tooth by taking a grip on it with the forceps and then stand there and drawl through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreaded jerk parentheses in literature and dentistry are in bad taste the germans have another kind of parenthesis which they make by splitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an exciting chapter and the other half at the end of it can any one conceive of anything more confusing than that these things are called separable verbs the german grammar is blistered all over with separable verbs and the wider the two portions of one of them are spread apart the better the author of the crime is pleased with his performance a favorite one is reiste ab which means departed here is an example which i culled from a novel and reduced to english the trunks being now ready he de after kissing his mother and sisters and once more pressing to his bosom his adored gretchen who dressed in simple white muslin with a single tuberose in the ample folds of her rich brown hair had tottered feebly down the stairs still pale from the terror and excitement of the past evening but longing to lay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she loved more dearly than life itself parted however it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs one is sure to lose his temper early and if he sticks to the subject and will not be warned it will at last either soften his brain or petrify it personal pronouns and adjectives are a fruitful nuisance in this language and should have been left out for instance the same sound sie means you and it means she and it means her and it means it and it means they and it means them think of the ragged poverty of a language which has to make one word do the work of six and a poor little weak thing of only three letters at that but mainly think of the exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is trying to convey this explains why whenever a person says sie to me i generally try to kill him if a stranger now observe the adjective here was a case where simplicity would have been an advantage therefore for no other reason the inventor of this language complicated it all he could when we wish to speak of our good friend or friends in our enlightened tongue we stick to the one form and have no trouble or hard feeling about it but with the german tongue it is different when a german gets his hands on an adjective he declines it and keeps on declining it until the common sense is all declined out of it it is as bad as latin he says for instance singular nominative mein guter freund my good friend genitives meines guten freundes of my good friend dative meinem guten freund to my good friend accusative meinen guten freund my good friend plural n meine guten freunde my good friendsg meiner guten freunde of my good friendsd meinen guten freunden to my good friends a meine guten freunde my good friends now let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize those variations and see how soon he will be elected one might better go without friends in germany than take all this trouble about them i have shown what a bother it is to decline a good male friend well this is only a third of the work for there is a variety of new distortions of the adjective to be learned when the object is feminine and still another when the object is neuter now there are more adjectives in this language than there are black cats in switzerland and they must all be as elaborately declined as the examples above suggested difficult troublesome these words cannot describe it i heard a californian student in heidelberg say in one of his calmest moods that he would rather decline two drinks than one german adjective the inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in complicating it in every way he could think of for instance if one is casually referring to a house haus or a horse pferd or a dog hund he spells these words as i have indicated but if he is referring to them in the dative case he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary e and spells them hause pferde hunde so as an added e often signifies the plural as the s does with us the new student is likely to go on for a month making twins out of a dative dog before he discovers his mistake and on the other hand many a new student who could ill afford loss has bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them because he ignorantly bought that dog in the dative singular when he really supposed he was talking plural which left the law on the sellers side of course by the strict rules of grammar and therefore a suit for recovery could not lie in german all the nouns begin with a capital letter now that is a good idea and a good idea in this language is necessarily conspicuous from its lonesomeness i consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea because by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the minute you see it you fall into error occasionally because you mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing and waste a good deal of time trying to dig a meaning out of it german names almost always do mean something and this helps to deceive the student i translated a passage one day which said that the infuriated tigress broke loose and utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest tannenwald when i was girding up my loins to doubt this i found out that tannenwald in this instance was a mans name every noun has a gender and there is no sense or system in the distribution so the gender of each must be learned separately and by heart there is no other way to do this one has to have a memory like a memorandum book in german a young lady has no sex while a turnip has think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip and what callous disrespect for the girl see how it looks in print i translate this from a conversation in one of the best of the german sunday school books gretchen wilhelm where is the turnip wilhelm she has gone to the kitchen gretchen where is the accomplished and beautiful english maiden wilhelm it has gone to the opera to continue with the german genders a tree is male its buds are female its leaves are neuter horses are sexless dogs are male cats are female tomcats included of course a persons mouth neck bosom elbows fingers nails feet and body are of the male sex and his head is male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it and not according to the sex of the individual who wears it for in germany all the women wear either male heads or sexless ones a persons nose lips shoulders breast hands and toes are of the female sex and his hair ears eyes chin legs knees heart and conscience havent any sex at all the inventor of the language probably got what he knew about a conscience from hearsay now by the above dissection the reader will see that in germany a man may think he is a man but when he comes to look into the matter closely he is bound to have his doubts he finds that in sober truth he is a most ridiculous mixture and if he ends by trying to comfort himself with the thought that he can at least depend on a third of this mess as being manly and masculine the humiliating second thought will quickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any woman or cow in the land in the german it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of the language a woman is a female but a wife weib is not which is unfortunate a wife here has no sex she is neuter so according to the grammar a fish is he his scales are she but a fishwife is neither to describe a wife as sexless may be called under description that is bad enough but over description is surely worse a german speaks of an englishman as the engl nnder to change the sex he adds inn and that stands for englishwoman engl nderinn that seems descriptive enough but still it is not exact enough for a german so he precedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to follow is feminine and writes it down thus die engl nderinn which means the she englishwoman i consider that that person is over described well after the student has learned the sex of a great number of nouns he is still in a difficulty because he finds it impossible to persuade his tongue to refer to things as he and she and him and her which it has been always accustomed to refer to as it when he even frames a german sentence in his mind with the hims and hers in the right places and then works up his courage to the utterance point it is no use the moment he begins to speak his tongue flies the track and all those labored males and females come out as its and even when he is reading german to himself he always calls those things it whereas he ought to read in this way tale of the fishwife and its sad fate i capitalize the nouns in the german and ancient english fashion it is a bleak day hear the rain how he pours and the hail how he rattles and see the snow how he drifts along and of the mud how deep he is ah the poor fishwife it is stuck fast in the mire it has dropped its basket of fishes and its hands have been cut by the scales as it seized some of the falling creatures and one scale has even got into its eye and it cannot get her out it opens its mouth to cry for help but if any sound comes out of him alas he is drowned by the raging of the storm and now a tomcat has got one of the fishes and she will surely escape with him no she bites off a fin she holds her in her mouth will she swallow her no the fishwifes brave mother dog deserts his puppies and rescues the fin which he eats himself as his rewardo horror the lightning has struck the fish basket he sets him on fire see the flame how she licks the doomed utensil with her red and angry tongue now she attacks the helpless fishwifes foot she burns him up all but the big toe and even she is partly consumed and still she spreads still she waves her fiery tongues she attacks the fishwifes leg and destroys it she attacks its hand and destroys her also she attacks the fishwifes leg and destroys her also she attacks its body and consumes him she wreathes herself about its heart and it is consumed next about its breast and in a moment she is a cinder now she reaches its neck he goes now its chin it goes now its nose she goes in another moment except help come the fishwife will be no more time presses is there none to succor and save yes joy joy with flying feet the she englishwoman comes but alas the generous she female is too late where now is the fated fishwife it has ceased from its sufferings it has gone to a better land all that is left of it for its loved ones to lament over is this poor smoldering ash heap ah woeful woeful ash heap let us take him up tenderly reverently upon the lowly shovel and bear him to his long rest with the prayer that when he rises again it will be a realm where he will have one good square responsible sex and have it all to himself instead of having a mangy lot of assorted sexes scattered all over him in spots there now the reader can see for himself that this pronoun business is a very awkward thing for the unaccustomed tongue i suppose that in all languages the similarities of look and sound between words which have no similarity in meaning are a fruitful source of perplexity to the foreigner it is so in our tongue and it is notably the case in the german now there is that troublesome word verm hlt to me it has so close a resemblance either real or fancied to three or four other words that i never know whether it means despised painted suspected or married until i look in the dictionary and then i find it means the latter there are lots of such words and they are a great torment to increase the difficulty there are words which seem to resemble each other and yet do not but they make just as much trouble as if they did for instance there is the word vermiethen to let to lease to hire and the word verheirathen another way of saying to marry i heard of an englishman who knocked at a mans door in heidelberg and proposed in the best german he could command to verheirathen that house then there are some words which mean one thing when you emphasize the first syllable but mean something very different if you throw the emphasis on the last syllable for instance there is a word which means a runaway or the act of glancing through a book according to the placing of the emphasis and another word which signifies to associate with a man or to avoid him according to where you put the emphasis and you can generally depend on putting it in the wrong place and getting into trouble there are some exceedingly useful words in this language schlag for example and zug there are three quarters of a column of schlags in the dictonary and a column and a half of zugs the word schlag means blow stroke dash hit shock clap slap time bar coin stamp kind sort manner way apoplexy wood cutting enclosure field forest clearing this is its simple and exact meaning that is to say its restricted its fettered meaning but there are ways by which you can set it free so that it can soar away as on the wings of the morning and never be at rest you can hang any word you please to its tail and make it mean anything you want to you can begin with schlag ader which means artery and you can hang on the whole dictionary word by word clear through the alphabet to schlag wasser which means bilge water and including schlag mutter which means mother in law just the same with zug strictly speaking zug means pull tug draught procession march progress flight direction expedition train caravan passage stroke touch line flourish trait of character feature lineament chess move organ stop team whiff bias drawer propensity inhalation disposition but that thing which it does not mean when all its legitimate pennants have been hung on has not been discovered yet one cannot overestimate the usefulness of schlag and zug armed just with these two and the word also what cannot the foreigner on german soil accomplish the german word also is the equivalent of the english phrase you know and does not mean anything at all in talk though it sometimes does in print every time a german opens his mouth an also falls out and every time he shuts it he bites one in two that was trying to get out now the foreigner equipped with these three noble words is master of the situation let him talk right along fearlessly let him pour his indifferent german forth and when he lacks for a word let him heave a schlag into the vacuum all the chances are that it fits it like a plug but if it doesnt let him promptly heave a zug after it the two together can hardly fail to bung the hole but if by a miracle they should fail let him simply say also and this will give him a moments chance to think of the needful word in germany when you load your conversational gun it is always best to throw in a schlag or two and a zug or two because it doesnt make any difference how much the rest of the charge may scatter you are bound to bag something with them then you blandly say also and load up again nothing gives such an air of grace and elegance and unconstraint to a german or an english conversation as to scatter it full of alsos or you knows in my note book i find this entry july in the hospital yesterday a word of thirteen syllables was successfully removed from a patient a north german from near hamburg but as most unfortunately the surgeons had opened him in the wrong place under the impression that he contained a panorama he died the sad event has cast a gloom over the whole community that paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about one of the most curious and notable features of my subject the length of german words some german words are so long that they have a perspective observe these examples freundschaftsbezeigungen dilettantenaufdringlichkeiten stadtverordnetenversammlungen these things are not words they are alphabetical processions and they are not rare one can open a german newspaper at any time and see them marching majestically across the page and if he has any imagination he can see the banners and hear the music too they impart a martial thrill to the meekest subject i take a great interest in these curiosities whenever i come across a good one i stuff it and put it in my museum in this way i have made quite a valuable collection when i get duplicates i exchange with other collectors and thus increase the variety of my stock here are some specimens which i lately bought at an auction sale of the effects of a bankrupt bric a brac hunter generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen alterthumswissenschaften kinderbewahrungsanstalten unabh ngigkeitserkl rungen wiedererstellungbestrebungen waffenstillstandsunterhandlungen of course when one of these grand mountain ranges goes stretching across the printed page it adorns and ennobles that literary landscape but at the same time it is a great distress to the new student for it blocks up his way he cannot crawl under it or climb over it or tunnel through it so he resorts to the dictionary for help but there is no help there the dictionary must draw the line somewhere so it leaves this sort of words out and it is right because these long things are hardly legitimate words but are rather combinations of words and the inventor of them ought to have been killed they are compound words with the hyphens left out the various words used in building them are in the dictionary but in a very scattered condition so you can hunt the materials out one by one and get at the meaning at last but it is a tedious and harassing business i have tried this process upon some of the above examples freundshaftsbezeigungen seems to be friendship demonstrations which is only a foolish and clumsy way of saying demonstrations of friendship unabh ngigkeitserkl rungen seems to be independencedeclarations which is no improvement upon declarations of independence so far as i can see generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen seems to be general statesrepresentativesmeetings as nearly as i can get at it a mere rhythmical gushy euphemism for meetings of the legislature i judge we used to have a good deal of this sort of crime in our literature but it has gone out now we used to speak of a thing as a never to be forgotten circumstance instead of cramping it into the simple and sufficient word memorable and then going calmly about our business as if nothing had happened in those days we were not content to embalm the thing and bury it decently we wanted to build a monument over it but in our newspapers the compounding disease lingers a little to the present day but with the hyphens left out in the german fashion this is the shape it takes instead of saying mr simmons clerk of the county and district courts was in town yesterday the new form puts it thus clerk of the county and district courts simmons was in town yesterday this saves neither time nor ink and has an awkward sound besides one often sees a remark like this in our papers mrs assistant district attorney johnson returned to her city residence yesterday for the season that is a case of really unjustifiable compounding because it not only saves no time or trouble but confers a title on mrs johnson which she has no right to but these little instances are trifles indeed contrasted with the ponderous and dismal german system of piling jumbled compounds together i wish to submit the following local item from a mannheim journal by way of illustration in the daybeforeyesterdayshortlyaftereleveno clock night the inthistownstandingtavern called the wagoner was downburnt when the fire to the onthedownburninghouseresting storks nest reached flew the parent storks away but when the bytheraging firesurrounded nest itself caught fire straightway plunged the quickreturning mother stork into the flames and died her wings over her young ones outspread even the cumbersome german construction is not able to take the pathos out of that picture indeed it somehow seems to strengthen it this item is dated away back yonder months ago i could have used it sooner but i was waiting to hear from the father stork i am still waiting also if i had not shown that the german is a difficult language i have at least intended to do so i have heard of an american student who was asked how he was getting along with his german and who answered promptly i am not getting along at all i have worked at it hard for three level months and all i have got to show for it is one solitary german phrase zwei glas two glasses of beer he paused for a moment reflectively then added with feeling but i ve got that solid and if i have not also shown that german is a harassing and infuriating study my execution has been at fault and not my intent i heard lately of a worn and sorely tried american student who used to fly to a certain german word for relief when he could bear up under his aggravations no longer the only word whose sound was sweet and precious to his ear and healing to his lacerated spirit this was the word damit it was only the sound that helped him not the meaning and so at last when he learned that the emphasis was not on the first syllable his only stay and support was gone and he faded away and died it merely means in its general sense herewith i think that a description of any loud stirring tumultuous episode must be tamer in german than in english our descriptive words of this character have such a deep strong resonant sound while their german equivalents do seem so thin and mild and energyless boom burst crash roar storm bellow blow thunder explosion howl cry shout yell groan battle hell these are magnificent words the have a force and magnitude of sound befitting the things which they describe but their german equivalents would be ever so nice to sing the children to sleep with or else my awe inspiring ears were made for display and not for superior usefulness in analyzing sounds would any man want to die in a battle which was called by so tame a term as a schlacht or would not a comsumptive feel too much bundled up who was about to go out in a shirt collar and a seal ring into a storm which the bird song word gewitter was employed to describe and observe the strongest of the several german equivalents for explosion ausbruch our word toothbrush is more powerful than that it seems to me that the germans could do worse than import it into their language to describe particularly tremendous explosions with the german word for hell hoelle sounds more like helly than anything else therefore how necessarily chipper frivolous and unimpressive it is if a man were told in german to go there could he really rise to thee dignity of feeling insulted having pointed out in detail the several vices of this language i now come to the brief and pleasant task of pointing out its virtues the capitalizing of the nouns i have already mentioned but far before this virtue stands another that of spelling a word according to the sound of it after one short lesson in the alphabet the student can tell how any german word is pronounced without having to ask whereas in our language if a student should inquire of us what does bo w spell we should be obliged to reply nobody can tell what it spells when you set if off by itself you can only tell by referring to the context and finding out what it signifies whether it is a thing to shoot arrows with or a nod of ones head or the forward end of a boat there are some german words which are singularly and powerfully effective for instance those which describe lowly peaceful and affectionate home life those which deal with love in any and all forms from mere kindly feeling and honest good will toward the passing stranger clear up to courtship those which deal with outdoor nature in its softest and loveliest aspects with meadows and forests and birds and flowers the fragrance and sunshine of summer and the moonlight of peaceful winter nights in a word those which deal with any and all forms of rest repose and peace those also which deal with the creatures and marvels of fairyland and lastly and chiefly in those words which express pathos is the language surpassingly rich and affective there are german songs which can make a stranger to the language cry that shows that the sound of the words is correct it interprets the meanings with truth and with exactness and so the ear is informed and through the ear the heart the germans do not seem to be afraid to repeat a word when it is the right one they repeat it several times if they choose that is wise but in english when we have used a word a couple of times in a paragraph we imagine we are growing tautological and so we are weak enough to exchange it for some other word which only approximates exactness to escape what we wrongly fancy is a greater blemish repetition may be bad but surely inexactness is worse there are people in the world who will take a great deal of trouble to point out the faults in a religion or a language and then go blandly about their business without suggesting any remedy i am not that kind of person i have shown that the german language needs reforming very well i am ready to reform it at least i am ready to make the proper suggestions such a course as this might be immodest in another but i have devoted upward of nine full weeks first and last to a careful and critical study of this tongue and thus have acquired a confidence in my ability to reform it which no mere superficial culture could have conferred upon me in the first place i would leave out the dative case it confuses the plurals and besides nobody ever knows when he is in the dative case except he discover it by accident and then he does not know when or where it was that he got into it or how long he has been in it or how he is ever going to get out of it again the dative case is but an ornamental folly it is better to discard it in the next place i would move the verb further up to the front you may load up with ever so good a verb but i notice that you never really bring down a subject with it at the present german range you only cripple it so i insist that this important part of speech should be brought forward to a position where it may be easily seen with the naked eye thirdly i would import some strong words from the english tongue to swear with and also to use in describing all sorts of vigorous things in a vigorous way verdammt and its variations and enlargements are words which have plenty of meaning but the sounds are so mild and ineffectual that german ladies can use them without sin german ladies who could not be induced to commit a sin by any persuasion or compulsion promptly rip out one of these harmless little words when they tear their dresses or dont like the soup it sounds about as wicked as our my gracious german ladies are constantly saying ach gott mein gott gott in himmel herr gott der herr jesus etc they think our ladies have the same custom perhaps for i once heard a gentle and lovely old german lady say to a sweet young american girl the two languages are so alike how pleasant that is we say ach gott you say goddamn fourthly i would reorganizes the sexes and distribute them accordingly to the will of the creator this as a tribute of respect if nothing else fifthly i would do away with those great long compounded words or require the speaker to deliver them in sections with intermissions for refreshments to wholly do away with them would be best for ideas are more easily received and digested when they come one at a time than when they come in bulk intellectual food is like any other it is pleasanter and more beneficial to take it with a spoon than with a shovel sixthly i would require a speaker to stop when he is done and not hang a string of those useless haven sind gewesen gehabt haben geworden seins to the end of his oration this sort of gewgaws undignify a speech instead of adding a grace they are therefore an offense and should be discarded seventhly i would discard the parenthesis also the reparenthesis the re reparenthesis and the re re re re re reparentheses and likewise the final wide reaching all enclosing king parenthesis i would require every individual be he high or low to unfold a plain straightforward tale or else coil it and sit on it and hold his peace infractions of this law should be punishable with death and eighthly and last i would retain zug and schlag with their pendants and discard the rest of the vocabulary this would simplify the language i have now named what i regard as the most necessary and important changes these are perhaps all i could be expected to name for nothing but there are other suggestions which i can and will make in case my proposed application shall result in my being formally employed by the government in the work of reforming the language my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english barring spelling and pronouncing in thirty hours french in thirty days and german in thirty years it seems manifest then that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired if it is to remain as it is it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages for only the dead have time to learn it a fourth of july oration in the german tongue delivered at a banquet of the anglo american club of students by the author of this book gentlemen since i arrived a month ago in this old wonderland this vast garden of germany my english tongue has so often proved a useless piece of baggage to me and so troublesome to carry around in a country where they havent the checking system for luggage that i finally set to work and learned the german language also es freut mich dass dies so ist denn es muss in ein haupts chlich degreeh flich sein dass man auf ein occasion like

until a line drawn upon a map shall be able to say this bars the ancestral blood from flowing in the veins of the descendant appendix e legend of the castles called the swallows nest and the brothers as condensed from the captains tale in the neighborhood of three hundred years ago the swallows nest and the larger castle between it and neckarsteinach were owned and occupied by two old knights who were twin brothers and bachelors they had no relatives they were very rich they had fought through the wars and retired to private life covered with honorable scars they were honest honorable men in their dealings but the people had given them a couple of nicknames which were very suggestive herr givenaught and herr heartless the old knights were so proud of these names that if a burgher called them by their right ones they would correct them the most renowned scholar in europe at the time was the herr doctor franz reikmann who lived in heidelberg all germany was proud of the venerable scholar who lived in the simplest way for great scholars are always poor he was poor as to money but very rich in his sweet young daughter hildegarde and his library he had been all his life collecting his library book and book and he lived it as a miser loves his hoarded gold he said the two strings of his heart were rooted the one in his daughter the other in his books and that if either were severed he must die now in an evil hour hoping to win a marriage portion for his child this simple old man had intrusted his small savings to a sharper to be ventured in a glittering speculation but that was not the worst of it he signed a paper without reading it that is the way with poets and scholars they always sign without reading this cunning paper made him responsible for heaps of things the rest was that one night he found himself in debt to the sharper eight thousand pieces of gold an amount so prodigious that it simply stupefied him to think of it it was a night of woe in that house i must part with my library i have nothing else so perishes one heartstring said the old man what will it bring father asked the girl nothing it is worth seven hundred pieces of gold but by auction it will go for little or nothing then you will have parted with the half of your heart and the joy of your life to no purpose since so mighty a burden of debt will remain behind there is no help for it my child our darlings must pass under the hammer we must pay what we can my father i have a feeling that the dear virgin will come to our help let us not lose heart she cannot devise a miracle that will turn nothing into eight thousand gold pieces and lesser help will bring us little peace she can do even greater things my father she will save us i know she will toward morning while the old man sat exhausted and asleep in his chair where he had been sitting before his books as one who watches by his beloved dead and prints the features on his memory for a solace in the aftertime of empty desolation his daughter sprang into the room and gently woke him saying my presentiment was true she will save us three times has she appeared to me in my dreams and said go to the herr givenaught go to the herr heartless ask them to come and bid there did i not tell you she would save us the thrice blessed virgin sad as the old man was he was obliged to laugh thou mightest as well appeal to the rocks their castles stand upon as to the harder ones that lie in those mens breasts my child they bid on books writ in the learned tongues they can scarce read their own but hildegardes faith was in no wise shaken bright and early she was on her way up the neckar road as joyous as a bird meantime herr givenaught and herr heartless were having an early breakfast in the formers castle the sparrows nest and flavoring it with a quarrel for although these twins bore a love for each other which almost amounted to worship there was one subject upon which they could not touch without calling each other hard names and yet it was the subject which they oftenest touched upon i tell you said givenaught you will beggar yourself yet with your insane squanderings of money upon what you choose to consider poor and worthy objects all these years i have implored you to stop this foolish custom and husband your means but all in vain you are always lying to me about these secret benevolences but you never have managed to deceive me yet every time a poor devil has been set upon his feet i have detected your hand in it incorrigible ass every time you didnt set him on his feet yourself you mean where i give one unfortunate a little private lift you do the same for a dozen the idea of your swelling around the country and petting yourself with the nickname of givenaught intolerable humbug before i would be such a fraud as that i would cut my right hand off your life is a continual lie but go on i have tried my best to save you from beggaring yourself by your riotous charities now for the thousandth time i wash my hands of the consequences a maundering old fool thats what you are and you a blethering old idiot roared givenaught springing up i wont stay in the presence of a man who has no more delicacy than to call me such names mannerless swine so saying herr heartless sprang up in a passion but some lucky accident intervened as usual to change the subject and the daily quarrel ended in the customary daily living reconciliation the gray headed old eccentrics parted and herr heartless walked off to his own castle half an hour later hildegarde was standing in the presence of herr givenaught he heard her story and said i am sorry for you my child but i am very poor i care nothing for bookish rubbish i shall not be there he said the hard words kindly but they nearly broke poor hildegardes heart nevertheless when she was gone the old heartbreaker muttered rubbing his hands it was a good stroke i have saved my brothers pocket this time in spite of him nothing else would have prevented his rushing off to rescue the old scholar the pride of germany from his trouble the poor child wont venture near him after the rebuff she has received from his brother the givenaught but he was mistaken the virgin had commanded and hildegarde would obey she went to herr heartless and told her story but he said coldly i am very poor my child and books are nothing to me i wish you well but i shall not come when hildegarde was gone he chuckled and said how my fool of a soft headed soft hearted brother would rage if he knew how cunningly i have saved his pocket how he would have flown to the old mans rescue but the girl wont venture near him now when hildegarde reached home her father asked her how she had prospered she said the virgin has promised and she will keep her word but not in the way i thought she knows her own ways and they are best the old man patted her on the head and smiled a doubting smile but he honored her for her brave faith nevertheless ii next day the people assembled in the great hall of the ritter tavern to witness the auction for the proprietor had said the treasure of germanys most honored son should be bartered away in no meaner place hildegarde and her father sat close to the books silent and sorrowful and holding each others hands there was a great crowd of people present the bidding began how much for this precious library just as it stands all complete called the auctioneer fifty pieces of gold a hundred two hundred three four five hundred five twenty five a brief pause five forty a longer pause while the auctioneer redoubled his persuasions five forty five a heavy drag the auctioneer persuaded pleaded implored it was useless everybody remained silent well then going going one two five hundred and fifty this in a shrill voice from a bent old man all hung with rags and with a green patch over his left eye everybody in his vicinity turned and gazed at him it was givenaught in disguise he was using a disguised voice too good cried the auctioneer going going one two five hundred and sixty this in a deep harsh voice from the midst of the crowd at the other end of the room the people near by turned and saw an old man in a strange costume supporting himself on crutches he wore a long white beard and blue spectacles it was herr heartless in disguise and using a disguised voice good again going going one six hundred sensation the crowd raised a cheer and some one cried out go it green patch this tickled the audience and a score of voices shouted go it green patch going going going third and last call one two seven hundred huzzah well done crutches cried a voice the crowd took it up and shouted altogether well done crutches splendid gentlemen you are doing magnificently going going a thousand three cheers for green patch up and at him crutches going going two thousand and while the people cheered and shouted crutches muttered who can this devil be that is fighting so to get these useless books but no matter he shan t have them the pride of germany shall have his books if it beggars me to buy them for him going going going three thousand come everybody give a rouser for green patch and while they did it green patch muttered this cripple is plainly a lunatic but the old scholar shall have his books nevertheless though my pocket sweat for it going going four thousand huzza five thousand huzza six thousand huzza seven thousand huzza eight thousand we are saved father i told you the holy virgin would keep her word blessed be her sacred name said the old scholar with emotion the crowd roared huzza huzza huzza at him again green patch going going ten thousand as givenaught shouted this his excitement was so great that he forgot himself and used his natural voice his brother recognized it and muttered under cover of the storm of cheers aha you are there are you besotted old fool take the books i know what you ll do with them so saying he slipped out of the place and the auction was at an end givenaught shouldered his way to hildegarde whispered a word in her ear and then he also vanished the old scholar and his daughter embraced and the former said truly the holy mother has done more than she promised child for she has given you a splendid marriage portion think of it two thousand pieces of gold and more still cried hildegarde for she has given you back your books the stranger whispered me that he would none of them the honored son of germany must keep them so he said i would i might have asked his name and kissed his hand and begged his blessing but he was our ladys angel and it is not meet that we of earth should venture speech with them that dwell above appendix f german journals the daily journals of hamburg frankfort baden munich and augsburg are all constructed on the same general plan i speak of these because i am more familiar with them than with any other german papers they contain no editorials whatever no personals and this is rather a merit than a demerit perhaps no funny paragraph column no police court reports no reports of proceedings of higher courts no information about prize fights or other dog fights horse races walking machines yachting contents rifle matches or other sporting matters of any sort no reports of banquet speeches no department of curious odds and ends of floating fact and gossip no rumors about anything or anybody no prognostications or prophecies about anything or anybody no lists of patents granted or sought or any reference to such things no abuse of public officials big or little or complaints against them or praises of them no religious columns saturdays no rehash of cold sermons mondays no weather indications no local item unveiling of what is happening in town nothing of a local nature indeed is mentioned beyond the movements of some prince or the proposed meeting of some deliberative body after so formidable a list of what one cant find in a german daily the question may well be asked what can be found in it it is easily answered a childs handful of telegrams mainly about european national and international political movements letter correspondence about the same things market reports there you have it that is what a german daily is made of a german daily is the slowest and saddest and dreariest of the inventions of man our own dailies infuriate the reader pretty often the german daily only stupefies him once a week the german daily of the highest class lightens up its heavy columns that is it thinks it lightens them up with a profound an abysmal book criticism a criticism which carries you down down down into the scientific bowels of the subject for the german critic is nothing if not scientific and when you come up at last and scent the fresh air and see the bonny daylight once more you resolve without a dissenting voice that a book criticism is a mistaken way to lighten up a german daily sometimes in place of the criticism the first class daily gives you what it thinks is a gay and chipper essay about ancient grecian funeral customs or the ancient egyptian method of tarring a mummy or the reasons for believing that some of the peoples who existed before the flood did not approve of cats these are not unpleasant subjects they are not uninteresting subjects they are even exciting subjects until one of these massive scientists gets hold of them he soon convinces you that even these matters can be handled in such a way as to make a person low spirited as i have said the average german daily is made up solely of correspondences a trifle of it by telegraph the rest of it by mail every paragraph has the side head london vienna or some other town and a date and always before the name of the town is placed a letter or a sign to indicate who the correspondent is so that the authorities can find him when they want to hang him stars crosses triangles squares half moons suns such are some of the signs used by correspondents some of the dailies move too fast others too slowly for instance my heidelberg daily was always twenty four hours old when it arrived at the hotel but one of my munich evening papers used to come a full twenty four hours before it was due some of the less important dailies give one a tablespoonful of a continued story every day it is strung across the bottom of the page in the french fashion by subscribing for the paper for five years i judge that a man might succeed in getting pretty much all of the story if you ask a citizen of munich which is the best munich daily journal he will always tell you that there is only one good munich daily and that it is published in augsburg forty or fifty miles away it is like saying that the best daily paper in new york is published out in new jersey somewhere yes the augsburg allgemeine zeitung is the best munich paper and it is the one i had in my mind when i was describing a first class german daily above the entire paper opened out is not quite as large as a single page of the new york herald it is printed on both sides of course but in such large type that its entire contents could be put in herald type upon a single page of the herald and there would still be room enough on the page for the zeitungs supplement and some portion of the zeitungs next days contents such is the first class daily the dailies actually printed in munich are all called second class by the public if you ask which is the best of these second class papers they say there is no difference one is as good as another i have preserved a copy of one of them it is called the m nchener tages anzeiger and bears date january comparisons are odious but they need not be malicious and without any malice i wish to compare this journal published in a german city of inhabitants with journals of other countries i know of no other way to enable the reader to size the thing a column of an average daily paper in america contains from to words the reading matter in a single issue consists of from to words the reading matter in my copy of the munich journal consists of a total of words for i counted them that would be nearly a column of one of our dailies a single issue of the bulkiest daily newspaper in the world the london times often contains words of reading matter considering that the daily anzeiger issues the usual twenty six numbers per month the reading matter in a single number of the london times would keep it in copy two months and a half the anzeiger is an eight page paper its page is one inch wider and one inch longer than a foolscap page that is to say the dimensions of its page are somewhere between those of a schoolboys slate and a ladys pocket handkerchief one fourth of the first page is taken up with the heading of the journal this gives it a rather top heavy appearance the rest of the first page is reading matter all of the second page is reading matter the other six pages are devoted to advertisements the reading matter is compressed into two hundred and five small pica lines and is lighted up with eight pica headlines the bill of fare is as follows first under a pica headline to enforce attention and respect is a four line sermon urging mankind to remember that although they are pilgrims here below they are yet heirs of heaven and that when they depart from earth they soar to heaven perhaps a four line sermon in a saturday paper is the sufficient german equivalent of the eight or ten columns of sermons which the new yorkers get in their monday morning papers the latest news two days old follows the four line sermon under the pica headline telegrams these are telegraphed with a pair of scissors out of the augsburger zeitung of the day before these telegrams consist of fourteen and two thirds lines from berlin fifteen lines from vienna and two and five eights lines from calcutta thirty three small pica lines of telegraphic news in a daily journal in a kings capital of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants is surely not an overdose next we have the pica heading news of the day under which the following facts are set forth prince leopold is going on a visit to vienna six lines prince arnulph is coming back from russia two lines the landtag will meet at ten o clock in the morning and consider an election law three lines and one word over a city government item five and one half lines prices of tickets to the proposed grand charity ball twenty three lines for this one item occupies almost one fourth of the entire first page there is to be a wonderful wagner concert in frankfurt on the main with an orchestra of one hundred and eight instruments seven and one half lines that concludes the first page eighty five lines altogether on that page including three headlines about fifty of those lines as one perceives deal with local matters so the reporters are not overworked exactly one half of the second page is occupied with an opera criticism fifty three lines three of them being headlines and death notices ten lines the other half of the second page is made up of two paragraphs under the head of miscellaneous news one of these paragraphs tells about a quarrel between the czar of russia and his eldest son twenty one and a half lines and the other tells about the atrocious destruction of a peasant child by its parents forty lines or one fifth of the total of the reading matter contained in the paper consider what a fifth part of the reading matter of an american daily paper issued in a city of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants amounts to think what a mass it is would any one suppose i could so snugly tuck away such a mass in a chapter of this book that it would be difficult to find it again if the reader lost his place surely not i will translate that child murder word for word to give the reader a realizing sense of what a fifth part of the reading matter of a munich daily actually is when it comes under measurement of the eye from oberkreuzberg january st the donau zeitung receives a long account of a crime which we shortened as follows in rametuach a village near eppenschlag lived a young married couple with two children one of which a boy aged five was born three years before the marriage for this reason and also because a relative at iggensbach had bequeathed m to the boy the heartless father considered him in the way so the unnatural parents determined to sacrifice him in the cruelest possible manner they proceeded to starve him slowly to death meantime frightfully maltreating him as the village people now make known when it is too late the boy was shut in a hole and when people passed by he cried and implored them to give him bread his long continued tortures and deprivations destroyed him at last on the third of january the sudden sic death of the child created suspicion the more so as the body was immediately clothed and laid upon the bier therefore the coroner gave notice and an inquest was held on the th what a pitiful spectacle was disclosed then the body was a complete skeleton the stomach and intestines were utterly empty they contained nothing whatsoever the flesh on the corpse was not as thick as the back of a knife and incisions in it brought not one drop of blood there was not a piece of sound skin the size of a dollar on the whole body wounds scars bruises discolored extravasated blood everywhere even on the soles of the feet there were wounds the cruel parents asserted that the boy had been so bad that they had been obliged to use severe punishments and that he finally fell over a bench and broke his neck however they were arrested two weeks after the inquest and put in the prison at deggendorf yes they were arrested two weeks after the inquest what a home sound that has that kind of police briskness rather more reminds me of my native land than german journalism does i think a german daily journal doesnt do any good to speak of but at the same time it doesnt do any harm that is a very large merit and should not be lightly weighted nor lightly thought of the german humorous papers are beautifully printed upon fine paper and the illustrations are finely drawn finely engraved and are not vapidly funny but deliciously so so also generally speaking are the two or three terse sentences which accompany the pictures i remember one of these pictures a most dilapidated tramp is ruefully contemplating some coins which lie in his open palm he says well begging is getting played out only about five marks for the whole day many an official makes more and i call to mind a picture of a commercial traveler who is about to unroll his samples merchant pettishly no dont i dont want to buy anything drummer if you please i was only going to show you merchant but i dont wish to see them drummer after a pause pleadingly but do you you mind letting me look at them i havent seen them for three weeks the prince and the pauper chapter i the birth of the prince and the pauper in the ancient city of london on a certain autumn day in the second quarter of the sixteenth century a boy was born to a poor family of the name of canty who did not want him on the same day another english child was born to a rich family of the name of tudor who did want him all england wanted him too england had so longed for him and hoped for him and prayed god for him that now that he was really come the people went nearly mad for joy mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each other and cried everybody took a holiday and high and low rich and poor feasted and danced and sang and got very mellow and they kept this up for days and nights together by day london was a sight to see with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop and splendid pageants marching along by night it was again a sight to see with its great bonfires at every corner and its troops of revellers making merry around them there was no talk in all england but of the new baby edward tudor prince of wales who lay lapped in silks and satins unconscious of all this fuss and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him and not caring either but there was no talk about the other baby tom canty lapped in his poor rags except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence chapter ii toms early life let us skip a number of years london was fifteen hundred years old and was a great town for that day it had a hundred thousand inhabitants some think double as many the streets were very narrow and crooked and dirty especially in the part where tom canty lived which was not far from london bridge the houses were of wood with the second story projecting over the first and the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second the higher the houses grew the broader they grew they were skeletons of strong criss cross beams with solid material between coated with plaster the beams were painted red or blue or black according to the owners taste and this gave the houses a very picturesque look the windows were small glazed with little diamond shaped panes and they opened outward on hinges like doors the house which toms father lived in was up a foul little pocket called offal court out of pudding lane it was small decayed and rickety but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families cantys tribe occupied a room on the third floor the mother and father had a sort of bedstead in the corner but tom his grandmother and his two sisters bet and nan were not restricted they had all the floor to themselves and might sleep where they chose there were the remains of a blanket or two and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw but these could not rightly be called beds for they were not organised they were kicked into a general pile mornings and selections made from the mass at night for service bet and nan were fifteen years old twins they were good hearted girls unclean clothed in rags and profoundly ignorant their mother was like them but the father and the grandmother were a couple of fiends they got drunk whenever they could then they fought each other or anybody else who came in the way they cursed and swore always drunk or sober john canty was a thief and his mother a beggar they made beggars of the children but failed to make thieves of them among but not of the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house was a good old priest whom the king had turned out of house and home with a pension of a few farthings and he used to get the children aside and teach them right ways secretly father andrew also taught tom a little latin and how to read and write and would have done the same with the girls but they were afraid of the jeers of their friends who could not have endured such a queer accomplishment in them all offal court was just such another hive as cantys house drunkenness riot and brawling were the order there every night and nearly all night long broken heads were as common as hunger in that place yet little tom was not unhappy he had a hard time of it but did not know it it was the sort of time that all the offal court boys had therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing when he came home empty handed at night he knew his father would curse him and thrash him first and that when he was done the awful grandmother would do it all over again and improve on it and that away in the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any miserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going hungry herself notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of treason and soundly beaten for it by her husband no toms life went along well enough especially in summer he only begged just enough to save himself for the laws against mendicancy were stringent and the penalties heavy so he put in a good deal of his time listening to good father andrews charming old tales and legends about giants and fairies dwarfs and genii and enchanted castles and gorgeous kings and princes his head grew to be full of these wonderful things and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw tired hungry and smarting from a thrashing he unleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in delicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince in a regal palace one desire came in time to haunt him day and night it was to see a real prince with his own eyes he spoke of it once to some of his offal court comrades but they jeered him and scoffed him so unmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that he often read the priests old books and got him to explain and enlarge upon them his dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him by and by his dream people were so fine that he grew to lament his shabby clothing and his dirt and to wish to be clean and better clad he went on playing in the mud just the same and enjoying it too but instead of splashing around in the thames solely for the fun of it he began to find an added value in it because of the washings and cleansings it afforded tom could always find something going on around the maypole in cheapside and at the fairs and now and then he and the rest of london had a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was carried prisoner to the tower by land or boat one summers day he saw poor anne askew and three men burned at the stake in smithfield and heard an ex bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him yes toms life was varied and pleasant enough on the whole by and by toms reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a strong effect upon him that he began to act the prince unconsciously his speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly to the vast admiration and amusement of his intimates but toms influence among these young people began to grow now day by day and in time he came to be looked up to by them with a sort of wondering awe as a superior being he seemed to know so much and he could do and say such marvellous things and withal he was so deep and wise toms remarks and toms performances were reported by the boys to their elders and these also presently began to discuss tom canty and to regard him as a most gifted and extraordinary creature full grown people brought their perplexities to tom for solution and were often astonished at the wit and wisdom of his decisions in fact he was become a hero to all who knew him except his own family these only saw nothing in him privately after a while tom organised a royal court he was the prince his special comrades were guards chamberlains equerries lords and ladies in waiting and the royal family daily the mock prince was received with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by tom from his romantic readings daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed in the royal council and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his imaginary armies navies and viceroyalties after which he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings eat his poor crust take his customary cuffs and abuse and then stretch himself upon his handful of foul straw and resume his empty grandeurs in his dreams and still his desire to look just once upon a real prince in the flesh grew upon him day by day and week by week until at last it absorbed all other desires and became the one passion of his life one january day on his usual begging tour he tramped despondently up and down the region round about mincing lane and little east cheap hour after hour bare footed and cold looking in at cook shop windows and longing for the dreadful pork pies and other deadly inventions displayed there for to him these were dainties fit for the angels that is judging by the smell they were for it had never been his good luck to own and eat one there was a cold drizzle of rain the atmosphere was murky it was a melancholy day at night tom reached home so wet and tired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother to observe his forlorn condition and not be moved after their fashion wherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed for a long time his pain and hunger and the swearing and fighting going on in the building kept him awake but at last his thoughts drifted away to far romantic lands and he fell asleep in the company of jewelled and gilded princelings who live in vast palaces and had servants salaaming before them or flying to execute their orders and then as usual he dreamed that he was a princeling himself all night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him he moved among great lords and ladies in a blaze of light breathing perfumes drinking in delicious music and answering the reverent obeisances of the glittering throng as it parted to make way for him with here a smile and there a nod of his princely head and when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness about him his dream had had its usual effect it had intensified the sordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold then came bitterness and heart break and tears chapter iii toms meeting with the prince tom got up hungry and sauntered hungry away but with his thoughts busy with the shadowy splendours of his nights dreams he wandered here and there in the city hardly noticing where he was going or what was happening around him people jostled him and some gave him rough speech but it was all lost on the musing boy by and by he found himself at temple bar the farthest from home he had ever travelled in that direction he stopped and considered a moment then fell into his imaginings again and passed on outside the walls of london the strand had ceased to be a country road then and regarded itself as a street but by a strained construction for though there was a tolerably compact row of houses on one side of it there were only some scattered great buildings on the other these being palaces of rich nobles with ample and beautiful grounds stretching to the river grounds that are now closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone tom discovered charing village presently and rested himself at the beautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days then idled down a quiet lovely road past the great cardinals stately palace toward a far more mighty and majestic palace beyond westminster tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of masonry the wide spreading wings the frowning bastions and turrets the huge stone gateway with its gilded bars and its magnificent array of colossal granite lions and other the signs and symbols of english royalty was the desire of his soul to be satisfied at last here indeed was a kings palace might he not hope to see a prince now a prince of flesh and blood if heaven were willing at each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue that is to say an erect and stately and motionless man at arms clad from head to heel in shining steel armour at a respectful distance were many country folk and people from the city waiting for any chance glimpse of royalty that might offer splendid carriages with splendid people in them and splendid servants outside were arriving and departing by several other noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure poor little tom in his rags approached and was moving slowly and timidly past the sentinels with a beating heart and a rising hope when all at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that almost made him shout for joy within was a comely boy tanned and brown with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises whose clothing was all of lovely silks and satins shining with jewels at his hip a little jewelled sword and dagger dainty buskins on his feet with red heels and on his head a jaunty crimson cap with drooping plumes fastened with a great sparkling gem several gorgeous gentlemen stood near his servants without a doubt oh he was a prince a prince a living prince a real prince without the shadow of a question and the prayer of the pauper boys heart was answered at last toms breath came quick and short with excitement and his eyes grew big with wonder and delight everything gave way in his mind instantly to one desire that was to get close to the prince and have a good devouring look at him before he knew what he was about he had his face against the gate bars the next instant one of the soldiers snatched him rudely away and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd of country gawks and london idlers the soldier said mind thy manners thou young beggar the crowd jeered and laughed but the young prince sprang to the gate with his face flushed and his eyes flashing with indignation and cried out how dar st thou use a poor lad like that how dar st thou use the king my fathers meanest subject so open the gates and let him in you should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then you should have heard them cheer and shout long live the prince of wales the soldiers presented arms with their halberds opened the gates and presented again as the little prince of poverty passed in in his fluttering rags to join hands with the prince of limitless plenty edward tudor said thou lookest tired and hungry thou st been treated ill come with me half a dozen attendants sprang forward to i dont know what interfere no doubt but they were waved aside with a right royal gesture and they stopped stock still where they were like so many statues edward took tom to a rich apartment in the palace which he called his cabinet by his command a repast was brought such as tom had never encountered before except in books the prince with princely delicacy and breeding sent away the servants so that his humble guest might not be embarrassed by their critical presence then he sat near by and asked questions while tom ate what is thy name lad tom canty an it please thee sir tis an odd one where dost live in the city please thee sir offal court out of pudding lane offal court truly tis another odd one hast parents parents have i sir and a grand dam likewise that is but indifferently precious to me god forgive me if it be offence to say it also twin sisters nan and bet then is thy grand dam not over kind to thee i take it neither to any other is she so please your worship she hath a wicked heart and worketh evil all her days doth she mistreat thee there be times that she stayeth her hand being asleep or overcome with drink but when she hath her judgment clear again she maketh it up to me with goodly beatings a fierce look came into the little princes eyes and he cried out what beatings oh indeed yes please you sir beatings and thou so frail and little hark ye before the night come she shall hie her to the tower the king my father in sooth you forget sir her low degree the tower is for the great alone true indeed i had not thought of that i will consider of her punishment is thy father kind to thee not more than gammer canty sir fathers be alike mayhap mine hath not a dolls temper he smiteth with a heavy hand yet spareth me he

be these fifteen an it please you sir the lady elizabeth my sister is fourteen and the lady jane grey my cousin is of mine own age and comely and gracious withal but my sister the lady mary with her gloomy mien and look you do thy sisters forbid their servants to smile lest the sin destroy their souls they oh dost think sir that they have servants the little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment then said and prithee why not who helpeth them undress at night who attireth them when they rise none sir would st have them take off their garment and sleep without like the beasts their garment have they but one ah good your worship what would they do with more truly they have not two bodies each it is a quaint and marvellous thought thy pardon i had not meant to laugh but thy good nan and thy bet shall have raiment and lackeys enow and that soon too my cofferer shall look to it no thank me not tis nothing thou speakest well thou hast an easy grace in it art learned i know not if i am or not sir the good priest that is called father andrew taught me of his kindness from his books know st thou the latin but scantly sir i doubt learn it lad tis hard only at first the greek is harder but neither these nor any tongues else i think are hard to the lady elizabeth and my cousin thou should st hear those damsels at it but tell me of thy offal court hast thou a pleasant life there in truth yes so please you sir save when one is hungry there be punch and judy shows and monkeys oh such antic creatures and so bravely dressed and there be plays wherein they that play do shout and fight till all are slain and tis so fine to see and costeth but a farthing albeit tis main hard to get the farthing please your worship tell me more we lads of offal court do strive against each other with the cudgel like to the fashion of the prentices sometimes the princes eyes flashed said he marry that would not i mislike tell me more we strive in races sir to see who of us shall be fleetest that would i like also speak on in summer sir we wade and swim in the canals and in the river and each doth duck his neighbour and splatter him with water and dive and shout and tumble and twould be worth my fathers kingdom but to enjoy it once prithee go on we dance and sing about the maypole in cheapside we play in the sand each covering his neighbour up and times we make mud pastry oh the lovely mud it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the world we do fairly wallow in the mud sir saving your worships presence oh prithee say no more tis glorious if that i could but clothe me in raiment like to thine and strip my feet and revel in the mud once just once with none to rebuke me or forbid meseemeth i could forego the crown and if that i could clothe me once sweet sir as thou art clad just once oho would st like it then so shall it be doff thy rags and don these splendours lad it is a brief happiness but will be not less keen for that we will have it while we may and change again before any come to molest a few minutes later the little prince of wales was garlanded with toms fluttering odds and ends and the little prince of pauperdom was tricked out in the gaudy plumage of royalty the two went and stood side by side before a great mirror and lo a miracle there did not seem to have been any change made they stared at each other then at the glass then at each other again at last the puzzled princeling said what dost thou make of this ah good your worship require me not to answer it is not meet that one of my degree should utter the thing then will i utter it thou hast the same hair the same eyes the same voice and manner the same form and stature the same face and countenance that i bear fared we forth naked there is none could say which was you and which the prince of wales and now that i am clothed as thou wert clothed it seemeth i should be able the more nearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier hark ye is not this a bruise upon your hand yes but it is a slight thing and your worship knoweth that the poor man at arms peace it was a shameful thing and a cruel cried the little prince stamping his bare foot if the king stir not a step till i come again it is a command in a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national importance that lay upon a table and was out at the door and flying through the palace grounds in his bannered rags with a hot face and glowing eyes as soon as he reached the great gate he seized the bars and tried to shake them shouting open unbar the gates the soldier that had maltreated tom obeyed promptly and as the prince burst through the portal half smothered with royal wrath the soldier fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the roadway and said take that thou beggars spawn for what thou got st me from his highness the crowd roared with laughter the prince picked himself out of the mud and made fiercely at the sentry shouting i am the prince of wales my person is sacred and thou shalt hang for laying thy hand upon me the soldier brought his halberd to a present arms and said mockingly i salute your gracious highness then angrily be off thou crazy rubbish here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince and hustled him far down the road hooting him and shouting way for his royal highness way for the prince of wales chapter iv the princes troubles begin after hours of persistent pursuit and persecution the little prince was at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself as long as he had been able to rage against the mob and threaten it royally and royally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at he was very entertaining but when weariness finally forced him to be silent he was no longer of use to his tormentors and they sought amusement elsewhere he looked about him now but could not recognise the locality he was within the city of london that was all he knew he moved on aimlessly and in a little while the houses thinned and the passers by were infrequent he bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed then where farringdon street now is rested a few moments then passed on and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered houses in it and a prodigious church he recognised this church scaffoldings were about everywhere and swarms of workmen for it was undergoing elaborate repairs the prince took heart at once he felt that his troubles were at an end now he said to himself it is the ancient grey friars church which the king my father hath taken from the monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children and new named it christs church right gladly will they serve the son of him who hath done so generously by them and the more that that son is himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this day or ever shall be he was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running jumping playing at ball and leap frog and otherwise disporting themselves and right noisily too they were all dressed alike and in the fashion which in that day prevailed among serving men and prentices that is to say each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size of a saucer which was not useful as a covering it being of such scanty dimensions neither was it ornamental from beneath it the hair fell unparted to the middle of the forehead and was cropped straight around a clerical band at the neck a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as low as the knees or lower full sleeves a broad red belt bright yellow stockings gartered above the knees low shoes with large metal buckles it was a sufficiently ugly costume the boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince who said with native dignity good lads say to your master that edward prince of wales desireth speech with him a great shout went up at this and one rude fellow said marry art thou his graces messenger beggar the princes face flushed with anger and his ready hand flew to his hip but there was nothing there there was a storm of laughter and one boy said didst mark that he fancied he had a sword belike he is the prince himself this sally brought more laughter poor edward drew himself up proudly and said i am the prince and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my fathers bounty to use me so this was vastly enjoyed as the laughter testified the youth who had first spoken shouted to his comrades ho swine slaves pensioners of his graces princely father where be your manners down on your marrow bones all of ye and do reverence to his kingly port and royal rags with boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did mock homage to their prey the prince spurned the nearest boy with his foot and said fiercely take thou that till the morrow come and i build thee a gibbet ah but this was not a joke this was going beyond fun the laughter ceased on the instant and fury took its place a dozen shouted hale him forth to the horse pond to the horse pond where be the dogs ho there lion ho fangs then followed such a thing as england had never seen before the sacred person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands and set upon and torn by dogs as night drew to a close that day the prince found himself far down in the close built portion of the city his body was bruised his hands were bleeding and his rags were all besmirched with mud he wandered on and on and grew more and more bewildered and so tired and faint he could hardly drag one foot after the other he had ceased to ask questions of anyone since they brought him only insult instead of information he kept muttering to himself offal court that is the name if i can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and i drop then am i saved for his people will take me to the palace and prove that i am none of theirs but the true prince and i shall have mine own again and now and then his mind reverted to his treatment by those rude christs hospital boys and he said when i am king they shall not have bread and shelter only but also teachings out of books for a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved and the heart i will keep this diligently in my remembrance that this days lesson be not lost upon me and my people suffer thereby for learning softeneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity the lights began to twinkle it came on to rain the wind rose and a raw and gusty night set in the houseless prince the homeless heir to the throne of england still moved on drifting deeper into the maze of squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were massed together suddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said out to this time of night again and hast not brought a farthing home i warrant me if it be so an i do not break all the bones in thy lean body then am i not john canty but some other the prince twisted himself loose unconsciously brushed his profaned shoulder and eagerly said oh art his father truly sweet heaven grant it be so then wilt thou fetch him away and restore me his father i know not what thou mean st i but know i am thy father as thou shalt soon have cause to oh jest not palter not delay not i am worn i am wounded i can bear no more take me to the king my father and he will make thee rich beyond thy wildest dreams believe me man believe me i speak no lie but only the truth put forth thy hand and save me i am indeed the prince of wales the man stared down stupefied upon the lad then shook his head and muttered gone stark mad as any tom o bedlam then collared him once more and said with a coarse laugh and an oath but mad or no mad i and thy gammer canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie or im no true man with this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away and disappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of human vermin chapter v tom as a patrician tom canty left alone in the princes cabinet made good use of his opportunity he turned himself this way and that before the great mirror admiring his finery then walked away imitating the princes high bred carriage and still observing results in the glass next he drew the beautiful sword and bowed kissing the blade and laying it across his breast as he had seen a noble knight do by way of salute to the lieutenant of the tower five or six weeks before when delivering the great lords of norfolk and surrey into his hands for captivity tom played with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh he examined the costly and exquisite ornaments of the room he tried each of the sumptuous chairs and thought how proud he would be if the offal court herd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur he wondered if they would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home or if they would shake their heads and say his overtaxed imagination had at last upset his reason at the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince was gone a long time then right away he began to feel lonely very soon he fell to listening and longing and ceased to toy with the pretty things about him he grew uneasy then restless then distressed suppose some one should come and catch him in the princes clothes and the prince not there to explain might they not hang him at once and inquire into his case afterward he had heard that the great were prompt about small matters his fear rose higher and higher and trembling he softly opened the door to the antechamber resolved to fly and seek the prince and through him protection and release six gorgeous gentlemen servants and two young pages of high degree clothed like butterflies sprang to their feet and bowed low before him he stepped quickly back and shut the door he said oh they mock at me they will go and tell oh why came i here to cast away my life he walked up and down the floor filled with nameless fears listening starting at every trifling sound presently the door swung open and a silken page said the lady jane grey the door closed and a sweet young girl richly clad bounded toward him but she stopped suddenly and said in a distressed voice oh what aileth thee my lord toms breath was nearly failing him but he made shift to stammer out ah be merciful thou in sooth i am no lord but only poor tom canty of offal court in the city prithee let me see the prince and he will of his grace restore to me my rags and let me hence unhurt oh be thou merciful and save me by this time the boy was on his knees and supplicating with his eyes and uplifted hands as well as with his tongue the young girl seemed horror stricken she cried out o my lord on thy knees and to me then she fled away in fright and tom smitten with despair sank down murmuring there is no help there is no hope now will they come and take me whilst he lay there benumbed with terror dreadful tidings were speeding through the palace the whisper for it was whispered always flew from menial to menial from lord to lady down all the long corridors from story to story from saloon to saloon the prince hath gone mad the prince hath gone mad soon every saloon every marble hall had its groups of glittering lords and ladies and other groups of dazzling lesser folk talking earnestly together in whispers and every face had in it dismay presently a splendid official came marching by these groups making solemn proclamation in the name of the king let none list to this false and foolish matter upon pain of death nor discuss the same nor carry it abroad in the name of the king the whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been stricken dumb soon there was a general buzz along the corridors of the prince see the prince comes poor tom came slowly walking past the low bowing groups trying to bow in return and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings with bewildered and pathetic eyes great nobles walked upon each side of him making him lean upon them and so steady his steps behind him followed the court physicians and some servants presently tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace and heard the door close behind him around him stood those who had come with him before him at a little distance reclined a very large and very fat man with a wide pulpy face and a stern expression his large head was very grey and his whiskers which he wore only around his face like a frame were grey also his clothing was of rich stuff but old and slightly frayed in places one of his swollen legs had a pillow under it and was wrapped in bandages there was silence now and there was no head there but was bent in reverence except this mans this stern countenanced invalid was the dread henry viii he said and his face grew gentle as he began to speak how now my lord edward my prince hast been minded to cozen me the good king thy father who loveth thee and kindly useth thee with a sorry jest poor tom was listening as well as his dazed faculties would let him to the beginning of this speech but when the words me the good king fell upon his ear his face blanched and he dropped as instantly upon his knees as if a shot had brought him there lifting up his hands he exclaimed thou the king then am i undone indeed this speech seemed to stun the king his eyes wandered from face to face aimlessly then rested bewildered upon the boy before him then he said in a tone of deep disappointment alack i had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth but i fear me tis not so he breathed a heavy sigh and said in a gentle voice come to thy father child thou art not well tom was assisted to his feet and approached the majesty of england humble and trembling the king took the frightened face between his hands and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it awhile as if seeking some grateful sign of returning reason there then pressed the curly head against his breast and patted it tenderly presently he said dost not know thy father child break not mine old heart say thou know st me thou dost know me dost thou not yea thou art my dread lord the king whom god preserve true true that is well be comforted tremble not so there is none here would hurt thee there is none here but loves thee thou art better now thy ill dream passeth ist not so thou wilt not miscall thyself again as they say thou didst a little while agone i pray thee of thy grace believe me i did but speak the truth most dread lord for i am the meanest among thy subjects being a pauper born and tis by a sore mischance and accident i am here albeit i was therein nothing blameful i am but young to die and thou canst save me with one little word oh speak it sir die talk not so sweet prince peace peace to thy troubled heart thou shalt not die tom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry god requite thy mercyo my king and save thee long to bless thy land then springing up he turned a joyful face toward the two lords in waiting and exclaimed thou heard st it i am not to die the king hath said it there was no movement save that all bowed with grave respect but no one spoke he hesitated a little confused then turned timidly toward the king saying i may go now go surely if thou desirest but why not tarry yet a little whither would st go tom dropped his eyes and answered humbly peradventure i mistook but i did think me free and so was i moved to seek again the kennel where i was born and bred to misery yet which harboureth my mother and my sisters and so is home to me whereas these pomps and splendours whereunto i am not used oh please you sir to let me go the king was silent and thoughtful a while and his face betrayed a growing distress and uneasiness presently he said with something of hope in his voice perchance he is but mad upon this one strain and hath his wits unmarred as toucheth other matter god send it may be so we will make trial then he asked tom a question in latin and tom answered him lamely in the same tongue the lords and doctors manifested their gratification also the king said twas not according to his schooling and ability but showeth that his mind is but diseased not stricken fatally how say you sir the physician addressed bowed low and replied it jumpeth with my own conviction sire that thou hast divined aright the king looked pleased with this encouragement coming as it did from so excellent authority and continued with good heart now mark ye all we will try him further he put a question to tom in french tom stood silent a moment embarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him then said diffidently i have no knowledge of this tongue so please your majesty the king fell back upon his couch the attendants flew to his assistance but he put them aside and said trouble me not it is nothing but a scurvy faintness raise me there tis sufficient come hither child there rest thy poor troubled head upon thy fathers heart and be at peace thou lt soon be well tis but a passing fantasy fear thou not thou lt soon be well then he turned toward the company his gentle manner changed and baleful lightnings began to play from his eyes he said list ye all this my son is mad but it is not permanent over study hath done this and somewhat too much of confinement away with his books and teachers see ye to it pleasure him with sports beguile him in wholesome ways so that his health come again he raised himself higher still and went on with energy he is mad but he is my son and englands heir and mad or sane still shall he reign and hear ye further and proclaim it whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh against the peace and order of these realms and shall to the gallows give me to drink i burn this sorrow sappeth my strength there take away the cup support me there that is well mad is he were he a thousand times mad yet is he prince of wales and i the king will confirm it this very morrow shall he be installed in his princely dignity in due and ancient form take instant order for it my lord hertford one of the nobles knelt at the royal couch and said the kings majesty knoweth that the hereditary great marshal of england lieth attainted in the tower it were not meet that one attainted peace insult not mine ears with his hated name is this man to live for ever am i to be baulked of my will is the prince to tarry uninstalled because forsooth the realm lacketh an earl marshal free of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours no by the splendour of god warn my parliament to bring me norfolks doom before the sun rise again else shall they answer for it grievously lord hertford said the kings will is law and rising returned to his former place gradually the wrath faded out of the old kings face and he said kiss me my prince there what fearest thou am i not thy loving father thou art good to me that am unworthyo mighty and gracious lord that in truth i know but but it grieveth me to think of him that is to die and ah tis like thee tis like thee i know thy heart is still the same even though thy mind hath suffered hurt for thou wert ever of a gentle spirit but this duke standeth between thee and thine honours i will have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great office comfort thee my prince trouble not thy poor head with this matter but is it not i that speed him hence my liege how long might he not live but for me take no thought of him my prince he is not worthy kiss me once again and go to thy trifles and amusements for my malady distresseth me i am aweary and would rest go with thine uncle hertford and thy people and come again when my body is refreshed tom heavy hearted was conducted from the presence for this last sentence was a death blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would be set free once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming the prince the prince comes his spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering files of bowing courtiers for he recognised that he was indeed a captive now and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage a forlorn and friendless prince except god in his mercy take pity on him and set him free and turn where he would he seemed to see floating in the air the severed head and the remembered face of the great duke of norfolk the eyes fixed on him reproachfully his old dreams had been so pleasant but this reality was so dreary chapter vi tom receives instructions tom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite and made to sit down a thing which he was loth to do since there were elderly men and men of high degree about him he begged them to be seated also but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them and remained standing he would have insisted but his uncle the earl of hertford whispered in his ear prithee insist not my lord it is not meet that they sit in thy presence the lord st john was announced and after making obeisance to tom he said i come upon the kings errand concerning a matter which requireth privacy will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend you here save my lord the earl of hertford observing that tom did not seem to know how to proceed hertford whispered him to make a sign with his hand and not trouble himself to speak unless he chose when the waiting gentlemen had retired lord st john said his majesty commandeth that for due and weighty reasons of state the princes grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his power till it be passed and he be as he was before to wit that he shall deny to none that he is the true prince and heir to englands greatness that he shall uphold his princely dignity and shall receive without word or sign of protest that reverence and observance which unto it do appertain of right and ancient usage that he shall cease to speak to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured out of the unwholesome imaginings of o er wrought fancy that he shall strive with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which he was wont to know and where he faileth he shall hold his peace neither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath forgot that upon occasions of state whensoever any matter shall perplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he should make he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that look on but take advice in that matter of the lord hertford or my humble self which are commanded of the king to be upon this service and close at call till this commandment be dissolved thus saith the kings majesty who sendeth greeting to your royal highness and prayeth that god will of his mercy quickly heal you and have you now and ever in his holy keeping the lord st john made reverence and stood aside tom replied resignedly the king hath said it none may palter with the kings command or fit it to his ease where it doth chafe with deft evasions the king shall be obeyed lord hertford said touching the kings majestys ordainment concerning books and such like serious matters it may peradventure please your highness to ease your time with lightsome entertainment lest you go wearied to the banquet and suffer harm thereby toms face showed inquiring surprise and a blush followed when he saw lord st johns eyes bent sorrowfully upon him his lordship said thy memory still wrongeth thee and thou hast shown surprise but suffer it not to trouble thee for tis a matter that will not bide but depart with thy mending malady my lord of hertford speaketh of the citys banquet which the kings majesty did promise some two months flown your highness should attend thou recallest it now it grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me said tom in a hesitating voice and blushed again at this moment the lady elizabeth and the lady jane grey were announced the two lords exchanged significant glances and hertford stepped quickly toward the door as the young girls passed him he said in a low voice i pray ye ladies seem not to observe his humours nor show surprise when his memory doth lapse it will grieve you to note how it doth stick at every trifle meantime lord st john was saying in toms ear please you sir keep diligently in mind his majestys desire remember all thou canst seem to remember all else let them not perceive that thou art much changed from thy wont for thou knowest how tenderly thy old play fellows bear thee in their hearts and how twould grieve them art willing sir that i remain and thine uncle tom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word for he was already learning and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself as best he might according to the kings command in spite of every precaution the conversation among the young people became a little embarrassing at times more than once in truth tom was near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his tremendous part but the tact of the princess elizabeth saved him or a word from one or the other of the vigilant lords thrown in apparently by chance had the same happy effect once the little lady jane turned to tom and dismayed him with this question hast paid thy duty to the queens majesty to day my lord tom hesitated looked distressed and was about to stammer out something at hazard when lord st john took the word and answered for him with the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate difficulties and to be ready for them he hath indeed madam and she did greatly hearten him as touching his majestys condition is it not so your highness tom mumbled something that stood for assent but felt that he was getting upon dangerous ground somewhat later it was mentioned that tom was to study no more at present whereupon her little ladyship exclaimed tis a pity tis a pity thou wert proceeding bravely but bide thy time in patience it will not be for long thou lt yet be graced with learning like thy father and make thy tongue master of as many languages as his good my prince my father cried tom off his guard for the moment i trow he cannot speak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may tell his meaning and as for learning of any sort soever he looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my lord st johns eyes he stopped blushed then continued low and sadly ah my malady persecuteth me again and my mind wandereth i meant the kings grace no irreverence we know it sir said the princess elizabeth taking her brothers hand between her two palms respectfully but caressingly trouble not thyself as to that the fault is none of thine but thy distempers thou rt a gentle comforter sweet lady said tom gratefully and my heart moveth me to thank thee fort an i may be so bold once the giddy little lady jane fired a simple greek phrase at tom the princess elizabeths quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the targets front that the shaft was overshot so she tranquilly delivered a return volley of sounding greek on toms behalf and then straightway changed the talk to other matters time wore on pleasantly and likewise smoothly on the whole snags and sandbars grew less and less frequent and tom grew more and more at his ease seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon helping him and overlooking his mistakes when it came out that the little ladies were to accompany him to the lord mayors banquet in the evening his heart gave a bound of relief and delight for he felt that he should not be friendless now among that multitude of strangers whereas an hour earlier the idea of their going with him would have been an insupportable terror to him toms guardian angels the two lords had had less comfort in the interview than the other parties to it they felt much as if they were piloting a great ship through a dangerous channel they were on the alert constantly and found their office no childs play wherefore at last when the ladies visit was drawing to a close and the lord guilford dudley was announced they not only felt that their charge had been sufficiently taxed for the present but also that they themselves were not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their anxious voyage all over again so they respectfully advised tom to excuse himself which he was very glad to do although a slight shade of disappointment might have been observed upon my lady janes face when she heard the splendid stripling denied admittance there was a pause now a sort of waiting silence which tom could not understand he glanced at lord hertford who gave him a sign but he failed to understand that also the ready elizabeth came to the rescue with her usual easy grace she made reverence and said have we leave of the princes grace my brother to go tom said indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will for the asking yet would i rather give them any other thing that in my poor power lieth than leave to take the light and blessing of their presence hence give ye good den and god be with ye then he smiled inwardly at the thought tis not for nought i have dwelt but among princes in my reading and taught my tongue some slight trick of their broidered and gracious speech withal when the illustrious maidens were gone tom turned wearily to his keepers and said may it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some corner and rest me lord hertford said so please your highness it is for you to command it is for us to obey that thou should st rest is indeed a needful thing since thou must journey to the city presently he touched a bell and a page appeared who was ordered to desire the presence of sir william herbert this gentleman came straightway and conducted tom to an inner apartment toms first movement there was to reach for a cup of water but a silk and velvet servitor seized it dropped upon one knee and offered it to him on a golden salver next the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins timidly asking leave with his eye but another silk and velvet discomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him he made two or three further efforts to help himself but being promptly forestalled each time he finally gave up with a sigh of resignation and a murmured beshrew me but i marvel they do not require to breathe for me also slippered and wrapped in a sumptuous robe he laid himself down at last to rest but not to sleep for his head was too full of thoughts and the room too full of people he could not dismiss the former so they stayed he did not know enough to dismiss the latter so they stayed also to his vast regret and theirs toms departure had left his two noble guardians alone they mused a while with much head shaking and walking the floor then lord st john said plainly what dost thou think plainly then this the king is near his end my nephew is mad mad will mount the throne and mad remain god protect england since she will need it verily it promiseth so indeed but have you no misgivings as to as to the speaker hesitated and finally stopped he evidently felt that he was upon delicate ground lord hertford stopped before him looked into his face with a clear frank eye and said speak on there is none to hear but me misgivings as to what i am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind and thou so near to him in blood my lord but craving pardon if i do offend seemeth it not strange that madness could so change his port and manner not but that his port and speech are princely still but that they differ in one unweighty trifle or another from what his custom was aforetime seemeth it not strange that madness should filch from his memory his fathers very lineaments the customs and observances that are his due from such as be about him and leaving him his latin strip him of his greek and french my lord be not offended but ease my mind of its disquiet and receive my grateful thanks it haunteth me his saying he was not the prince and so peace my lord thou utterest treason hast forgot the kings command remember i am party to thy crime if i but listen st john paled and hastened to say i was in fault i do confess it betray me not grant me this grace out of thy courtesy and i will neither think nor speak of this thing more deal not hardly with me sir else am i ruined i am content my lord so thou offend not again here or in the ears of others it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken but thou need st not have misgivings he is my sisters son are not his voice his face his form familiar to me from his cradle madness can do all the odd conflicting things thou seest in him and more dost not recall how that the old baron marley being mad forgot the favour of his own countenance that he had known for sixty years and held it was anothers nay even claimed he was the son of mary magdalene and that his head was made of spanish glass and sooth to say he suffered none to touch it lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it give thy misgivings easement good my lord this is the very prince i know him well and soon will be thy king it may advantage thee to bear this in mind and more dwell upon it than the other after some further talk in which the lord st john covered up his mistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith was thoroughly grounded now and could not be assailed by doubts again the lord hertford relieved his fellow keeper and sat down to keep watch and ward alone he was soon deep in meditation and evidently the longer he thought the more he was bothered by and by he began to pace the floor and mutter tush he must be the prince will any be in all the land maintain there can be two not of one blood and birth so marvellously twinned and even were it so twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should cast the one into the others place nay tis folly folly folly presently he said now were he impostor and called himself prince look you that would be natural that would be reasonable but lived ever an impostor yet who being called prince by the king prince by the court prince by all denied his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation no by the soul of st swithin no this is the true prince gone mad chapter vii toms first royal dinner somewhat after one in the afternoon tom resignedly underwent the ordeal of being dressed for dinner he found himself as finely clothed as before but everything different everything changed from his ruff to his stockings he was presently conducted with much state to a spacious and ornate apartment where a table was already set for one its furniture was all of massy gold and beautified with designs which well nigh made it priceless since they were the work of benvenuto the room was half filled with noble servitors a chaplain said grace and tom was about to fall to for hunger had long been constitutional with him but was interrupted by my lord the earl of berkeley who fastened a napkin about his neck for the great post of diaperers to the prince of wales was hereditary in this noblemans family toms cupbearer was present and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine the taster to his highness the prince of wales was there also prepared to taste any suspicious dish upon requirement and run the risk of being poisoned he was only an ornamental appendage at this time and was seldom called upon to exercise his function but there had been times not many generations past when the office of taster had its perils and was not a grandeur to be desired why they did not use a dog or a plumber seems strange but all the ways of royalty are strange my lord d arcy first groom of the chamber was there to do goodness knows what but there he was let that suffice the lord chief butler was there and stood behind toms chair overseeing the solemnities under command of the lord great steward and the lord head cook who stood near tom had three hundred and eighty four servants beside these but they were not all in that room of course nor the quarter of them neither was tom aware yet that they existed all those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to remember that the prince was temporarily out of his head and to be careful to show no surprise at his vagaries these vagaries were soon on exhibition before them but they only moved their compassion and their sorrow not their mirth it was a heavy affliction to them to see the beloved prince so stricken poor tom ate with his fingers mainly but no one smiled at it or even seemed to observe it he inspected his napkin curiously and with deep interest for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric then said with simplicity prithee take it away lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled the hereditary diaperer took it away with reverent manner and without word or protest of any sort tom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest and asked what they were and if they were to be eaten for it was only recently that men had begun to raise these things in england in place of importing them as luxuries from holland his question was answered with grave respect and no surprise manifested when he had finished his dessert he filled his pockets with nuts but nobody appeared to be aware of it or disturbed by it but the next moment he was himself disturbed by it and showed discomposure for this was the only service he had been permitted to do with his own hands during the meal and he did not doubt that he had done a most improper and unprincely thing at that moment the muscles of his nose began to twitch and the end of that organ to lift and wrinkle this continued and tom began to evince a growing distress he looked appealingly first at one and then another of the lords about him and tears came into his eyes they sprang forward with dismay in their faces and begged to know his trouble tom said with genuine anguish i crave your indulgence my nose itcheth cruelly what is the custom and usage in this emergence prithee speed for tis but a little time that i can bear it none smiled but all were sore perplexed and looked one to the other in deep tribulation for counsel but behold here was a dead wall and nothing in english history to tell how to get over it the master of ceremonies was not present there was no one who felt safe to venture upon this uncharted sea or risk the attempt to solve this solemn problem alas there was no hereditary scratcher meantime the tears had overflowed their banks and begun to trickle down toms cheeks his twitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief at last nature broke down the barriers of etiquette tom lifted up an inward prayer for pardon if he was doing wrong and brought relief to the burdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself his meal being ended a lord came and held before him a broad shallow golden dish with fragrant rosewater in it to cleanse his mouth and fingers with and my lord the hereditary diaperer stood by with a napkin for his use tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two then raised it to his lips and gravely took a draught then he returned it to the waiting lord and said nay it likes me not my lord it hath a pretty flavour but it wanteth strength this new eccentricity of the princes ruined mind made all the hearts about him ache but the sad sight moved none to merriment toms next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table just when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair and with uplifted hands and closed uplifted eyes was in the act of beginning the blessing still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done a thing unusual by his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private cabinet and left there alone to his own devices hanging upon hooks in the oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel armour covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid in gold this martial panoply belonged to the true prince a recent present from madam parr the queen tom put on the greaves the gauntlets the plumed helmet and such other pieces as he could don without assistance and for a while was minded to call for help and complete the matter but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away from dinner and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye him and no grand hereditaries to pester him with undesired services so he restored the pretty things to their several places and soon was cracking nuts and feeling almost naturally happy for the first time since god for his sins had made him a prince when the nuts were all gone he stumbled upon some inviting books in a closet among them one about the etiquette of the english court this was a prize he lay down upon a sumptuous divan and proceeded to instruct himself with honest zeal let us leave him there for the present chapter viii the question of the seal about five o clock henry viii awoke out of an unrefreshing nap and muttered to himself troublous dreams troublous dreams mine end is now at hand so say these warnings and my failing pulses do confirm it presently a wicked light flamed up in his eye and he muttered yet will not i die till he go before his attendants perceiving that he was awake one of them asked his pleasure concerning the lord chancellor who was waiting without admit him admit him exclaimed the king eagerly the lord chancellor entered and knelt by the kings couch saying i have given order and according to the kings command the peers of the realm in their robes do now stand at the bar of the house where having confirmed the duke of norfolks doom they humbly wait his majestys further pleasure in the matter the kings face lit up with a fierce joy said he lift me up in mine own person will i go before my parliament and with mine own hand will i seal the warrant that rids me of his voice failed an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks and the attendants eased him back upon his pillows and hurriedly assisted him with restoratives presently he said sorrowfully alack how have i longed for this sweet hour and lo too late it cometh and i am robbed of this so coveted chance but speed ye speed ye let others do this happy office sith tis denied to me i put my great seal in commission choose thou the lords that shall compose it and get ye to your work speed ye man before the sun shall rise and set again bring me his head that i may see it according to the kings command so shall it be willt please your majesty to order that the seal be now restored to me so that i may forth upon the business the seal who keepeth the seal but thou please your majesty you did take it from me two days since saying it should no more do its office till your own royal hand should use it upon the duke of norfolks warrant why so in sooth i did i do remember what did i with it i am very feeble so oft these days doth my memory play the traitor with me tis strange strange the king dropped into inarticulate mumblings shaking his grey head weakly from time to time and gropingly trying to recollect what he had done with the seal at last my lord hertford ventured to kneel and offer information sire if that i may be so bold here be several that do remember with me how that you gave the great seal into the hands of his highness the prince of wales to keep against the day that true most true interrupted the king fetch it go time flieth lord hertford flew to tom but returned to the king before very long troubled and empty handed he delivered himself to this effect it grieveth me my lord the king to bear so heavy and unwelcome tidings but it is the will of god that the princes affliction abideth still and he cannot recall to mind that he received the seal so came i quickly to report thinking it were waste of precious time and little worth withal that any should attempt to search the long array of chambers and saloons that belong unto his royal high a groan from the king interrupted the lord at this point after a little while his majesty said with a deep sadness in his tone trouble him no more poor child the hand of god lieth heavy upon him and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him and sorrow that i may not bear his burden on mine old trouble weighted shoulders and so bring him peace he closed his eyes fell to mumbling and presently was silent after a time he opened his eyes again and gazed vacantly around until his glance rested upon the kneeling lord chancellor instantly his face flushed with wrath what thou here yet by the glory of god an thou gettest not about that traitors business thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for lack of a head to grace withal the trembling chancellor answered good your majesty i cry you mercy i but waited for the seal man hast lost thy wits the small seal which aforetime i was wont to take with me abroad lieth in my treasury and since the great seal hath flown away shall not it suffice hast lost thy wits begone and hark ye come no more till thou do bring his head the poor chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous vicinity nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent to the work of the slavish parliament and appointing the morrow for the beheading of the premier peer of england the luckless duke of norfolk chapter ix the river pageant at nine in the evening the whole vast river front of the palace was blazing with light the river itself as far as the eye could reach citywards was so thickly covered with watermens boats and with pleasure barges all fringed with coloured lanterns and gently agitated by the waves that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of flowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds the grand terrace of stone steps leading down to the water spacious enough to mass the army of a german principality upon was a picture to see with its ranks of royal halberdiers in polished armour and its troops of brilliantly costumed servitors flitting up and down and to and fro in the hurry of preparation presently a command was given and immediately all living creatures vanished from the steps now the air was heavy with the hush of suspense and expectancy as far as ones vision could carry he might see the myriads of people in the boats rise up and shade their eyes from the glare of lanterns and torches and gaze toward the palace a file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps they were richly gilt and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved some of them were decorated with banners and streamers some with cloth of gold and arras embroidered with coats of arms others with silken flags that had numberless little silver bells fastened to them which shook out tiny showers of joyous music whenever the breezes fluttered them others of yet higher pretensions since they belonged to nobles in the princes immediate service had their sides picturesquely fenced with shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings each state barge was towed by a tender besides the rowers these tenders carried each a number of men at arms in glossy helmet and breastplate and a company of musicians the advance guard of the expected procession now appeared in the great gateway a troop of halberdiers they were dressed in striped hose of black and tawny velvet caps graced at the sides with silver roses and doublets of murrey and blue cloth embroidered on the front and back with the three feathers the princes blazon woven in gold their halberd staves were covered with crimson velvet fastened with gilt nails and ornamented with gold tassels filing off on the right and left they formed two long lines extending from the gateway of the palace to the waters edge a thick rayed cloth or carpet was then unfolded and laid down between them by attendants in the gold and crimson liveries of the prince this done a flourish of trumpets resounded from within a lively prelude arose from the musicians on the water and two ushers with white wands marched with a slow and stately pace from the portal they were followed by an officer bearing the civic mace after whom came another carrying the citys sword then several sergeants of the city guard in their full accoutrements and with badges on their sleeves then the garter king at arms in his tabard then several knights of the bath each with a white lace on his sleeve then their esquires then the judges in their robes of scarlet and coifs then the lord high chancellor of england in a robe of scarlet open before and purfled with minever then a deputation of aldermen in their scarlet cloaks and then the heads of the different civic companies in their robes of state now came twelve french gentlemen in splendid habiliments consisting of pourpoints of white damask barred with gold short mantles of crimson velvet lined with violet taffeta and carnation coloured hauts de chausses and took their way down the steps they were of the suite of the french ambassador and were followed by twelve cavaliers of the suite of the spanish ambassador clothed in black velvet unrelieved by any ornament following these came several great english nobles with their attendants there was a flourish of trumpets within and the princes uncle the future great duke of somerset emerged from the gateway arrayed in a doublet of black cloth of gold and a cloak of crimson satin flowered with gold and ribanded with nets of silver he turned doffed his plumed cap bent his body in a low reverence and began to step backward bowing at each step a prolonged trumpet blast followed and a proclamation way for the high and mighty the lord edward prince of wales high aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of flame leapt forth with a thunder crash the massed world on the river burst into a mighty roar of welcome and tom canty the cause and hero of it all stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head he was magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin with a front piece of purple cloth of tissue powdered with diamonds and edged with ermine over this he wore a mantle of white cloth of gold pounced with the triple feathered crest lined with blue satin set with pearls and precious stones and fastened with a clasp of brilliants about his neck hung the order of the garter and several princely foreign orders and wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash o tom canty born in a hovel bred in the gutters of london familiar with rags and dirt and misery what a spectacle is this chapter x the prince in the toils we left john canty dragging the rightful prince into offal court with a noisy and delighted mob at his heels there was but one person in it who offered a pleading word for the captive and he was not heeded he was hardly even heard so great was the turmoil the prince continued to struggle for freedom and to rage against the treatment he was suffering until john canty lost what little patience was left in him and raised his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the princes head the single pleader for the lad sprang to stop the mans arm and the blow descended upon his own wrist canty roared out thou lt meddle wilt thou then have thy reward his cudgel crashed down upon the meddlers head there was a groan a dim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd and the next moment it lay there in the dark alone the mob pressed on their enjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode presently the prince found himself in john cantys abode with the door closed against the outsiders by the vague light of a tallow candle which was thrust into a bottle he made out the main features of the loathsome den and also the occupants of it two frowsy girls and a middle aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner with the aspect of animals habituated to harsh usage and expecting and dreading it now from another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey hair and malignant eyes john canty said to this one tarry theres fine mummeries here mar them not till thou st enjoyed them then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt stand forth lad now say thy foolery again an thou st not forgot it name thy name who art thou the insulted blood mounted to the little princes cheek once more and he lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the mans face and said tis but ill breeding in such as thou to command me to speak i tell thee now as i told thee before i am edward prince of wales and none other the stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hags feet to the floor where she stood and almost took her breath she stared at the prince in stupid amazement which so amused her ruffianly son that he burst into a roar of laughter but the effect upon tom cantys mother and sisters was different their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to distress of a different sort they ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces exclaiming oh poor tom poor lad the mother fell on her knees before the prince put her hands upon his shoulders and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears then she said oh my poor boy thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at last and ta en thy wit away ah why did st thou cleave to it when i so warned thee gainst it thou st broke thy mothers heart the prince looked into her face and said gently thy son is well and hath not lost his wits good dame comfort thee let me to the palace where he is and straightway will the king my father restore him to thee the king thy father oh my child unsay these words that be freighted with death for thee and ruin for all that be near to thee shake of this gruesome dream call back thy poor wandering memory look upon me am not i thy mother that bore thee and loveth thee the prince shook his head and reluctantly said god knoweth i am loth to grieve thy heart but truly have i never looked upon thy face before the woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor and covering her eyes with her hands gave way to heart broken sobs and wailings let the show go on shouted canty what nan what bet mannerless wenches will ye stand in the princes presence upon your knees ye pauper scum and do him reverence he followed this with another horse laugh the girls began to plead timidly for their brother and nan said an thou wilt but let him to bed father rest and sleep will heal his madness prithee do do father said bet he is more worn than is his wont to morrow will he be himself again and will beg with diligence and come not empty home again this remark sobered the fathers joviality and brought his mind to business he turned angrily upon the prince and said the morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole two pennies mark ye all this money for a half years rent else out of this we go show what thou st gathered with thy lazy begging the prince said offend me not with thy sordid matters i tell thee again i am the kings son a sounding blow upon the princes shoulder from cantys broad palm sent him staggering into goodwife cantys arms who clasped him to her breast and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by interposing her own person the frightened girls retreated to their corner but the grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son the prince sprang away from mrs canty exclaiming thou shalt not suffer for me madam let these swine do their will upon me alone this speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about their work without waste of time between them they belaboured the boy right soundly and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for showing sympathy for the victim now said canty to bed all of ye the entertainment has tired me the light was put out and the family retired as soon as the snorings of the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep the young girls crept to where the prince lay and covered him tenderly from the cold with straw and rags and their mother crept to him also and stroked his hair and cried over him whispering broken words of comfort and compassion in his ear the while she had saved a morsel for him to eat also but the boys pains had swept away all appetite at least for black and tasteless crusts he was touched by her brave and costly defence of him and by her commiseration and he thanked her in very noble and princely words and begged her to go to her sleep and try to forget her sorrows and he added that the king his father would not let her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded this return to his madness broke her heart anew and she strained him to her breast again and again and then went back drowned in tears to her bed as she lay thinking and mourning the suggestion began to creep into her mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was lacking in tom canty mad or sane she could not describe it she could not tell just what it was and yet her sharp mother instinct seemed to detect it and perceive it what if the boy were really not her son after all oh absurd she almost smiled at the idea spite of her griefs and troubles no matter she found that it was an idea that would not down but persisted in haunting her it pursued her it harassed her it clung to her and refused to be put away or ignored at last she perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her until she should devise a test that should prove clearly and without question whether this lad was her son or not and so banish these wearing and worrying doubts ah yes this was plainly the right way out of the difficulty therefore she set her wits to work at once to contrive that test but it was an easier thing to propose than to accomplish she turned over in her mind one promising test after another but was obliged to relinquish them all none of them were absolutely sure absolutely perfect and an imperfect one could not satisfy her evidently she was racking her head in vain it seemed manifest that she must give the matter up while this depressing thought was passing through her mind her ear caught the regular breathing of the boy and she knew he had fallen asleep and while she listened the measured breathing was broken by a soft startled cry such as one utters in a troubled dream this chance occurrence furnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests combined she at once set herself feverishly but noiselessly to work to relight her candle muttering to herself had i but seen him then i should have known since that day when he was little that the powder burst in his face he hath never been startled of a sudden out of his dreams or out of his thinkings but he hath cast his hand before his eyes even as he did that day and not as others would do it with the palm inward but always with the palm turned outward i have seen it a hundred times and it hath never varied nor ever failed yes i shall soon know now by this time she had crept to the slumbering boys side with the candle shaded in her hand she bent heedfully and warily over him scarcely breathing in her suppressed excitement and suddenly flashed the light in his face and struck the floor by his ear with her knuckles the sleepers eyes sprang wide open and he cast a startled stare about him but he made no special movement with his hands the poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and grief but she contrived to hide her emotions and to soothe the boy to sleep again then she crept apart and communed miserably with herself upon the disastrous result of her experiment she tried to believe that her toms madness had banished this habitual gesture of his but she could not do it no she said his hands are not mad they could not unlearn so old a habit in so brief a time oh this is a heavy day for me still hope was as stubborn now as doubt had been before she could not bring herself to accept the verdict of the test she must try the thing again the failure must have been only an accident so she startled the boy out of his sleep a second and a third time at intervals with the same result which had marked the first test then she dragged herself to bed and fell sorrowfully asleep saying but i cannot give him up oh no i cannot i cannot he must be my boy the poor mothers interruptions having ceased and the princes pains having gradually lost their power to disturb him utter weariness at last sealed his eyes in a profound and restful sleep hour after hour slipped away and still he slept like the dead thus four or five hours passed then his stupor began to lighten presently while half asleep and half awake he murmured sir william after a moment ho sir william herbert hie thee hither and list to the strangest dream that ever sir william dost hear man i did think me changed to a pauper and ho there guards sir william what is there no groom of the chamber in waiting alack it shall go hard with what aileth thee asked a whisper near him who art thou calling sir william herbert who art thou i who should i be but thy sister nan oh tom i had forgot thou rt mad yet poor lad thou rt mad yet would i had never woke to know it again but prithee master thy tongue lest we be all beaten till we die the startled prince sprang partly up but a sharp reminder from his stiffened bruises brought him to himself and he sank back among his foul straw with a moan and the ejaculation alas it was no dream then in a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had banished were upon him again and he realised that he was no longer a petted prince in a palace with the adoring eyes of a nation upon him but a pauper an outcast clothed in rags prisoner in a den fit only for beasts and consorting with beggars and thieves in the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious noises and shoutings apparently but a block or two away the next moment there were several sharp raps at the door john canty ceased from snoring and said who knocketh what wilt thou a voice answered know st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on no neither know i nor care belike thou lt change thy note eftsoons an thou would save thy neck nothing but flight may stead thee the man is this moment delivering up the ghost tis the priest father andrew god a mercy exclaimed canty he roused his family and hoarsely commanded up with ye all and fly or bide where ye are and perish scarcely five minutes later the canty household were in the street and flying for their lives john canty held the prince by the wrist and hurried him along the dark way giving him this caution in a low voice mind thy tongue thou mad fool and speak not our name i will choose me a new name speedily to throw the laws dogs off the scent mind thy tongue i tell thee he growled these words to the rest of the family if it so chance that we be separated let each make for london bridge whoso findeth himself as far as the last linen drapers shop on the bridge let him tarry there till the others be come then will we flee into southwark together at this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light and not only into light but into the midst of a multitude of singing dancing and shouting people massed together on the river frontage there was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see up and down the thames london bridge was illuminated southwark bridge likewise the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of coloured lights and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies with an intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain of dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day everywhere were crowds of revellers all london seemed to be at large john canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat but it was too late he and his tribe were swallowed up in that swarming hive of humanity and hopelessly separated from each other in an instant we are not considering that the prince was one of his tribe canty still kept his grip upon him the princes heart was beating high with hopes of escape now a burly waterman considerably exalted with liquor found himself rudely shoved by canty in his efforts to plough through the crowd he laid his great hand on cantys shoulder and said nay whither so fast friend dost canker thy soul with sordid business when all that be leal men and true make holiday mine affairs are mine own they concern thee not answered canty roughly take away thy hand and let me pass sith that is thy humour thou lt not pass till thou st drunk to the prince of wales i tell thee that said the waterman barring the way resolutely give me the cup then and make speed make speed other revellers were interested by this time they cried out the loving cup the loving cup make the sour knave drink the loving cup else will we feed him to the fishes so a huge loving cup was brought the waterman grasping it by one of its handles and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary napkin presented it in due and ancient form to canty who had to grasp the opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the other according to ancient custom this left the prince hand free for a second of course he wasted no time but dived among the forest of legs about him and disappeared in another moment he could not have been harder to find under that tossing sea of life if its billows had been the atlantics and he a lost sixpence he very soon realised this fact and straightway busied himself about his own affairs without further thought of john canty he quickly realised another thing too to wit that a spurious prince of wales was being feasted by the city in his stead he easily concluded that the pauper lad tom canty had deliberately taken advantage of his stupendous opportunity and become a usurper therefore there was but one course to pursue find his way to the guildhall make himself known and denounce the impostor he also made up his mind that tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual preparation and then be hanged drawn and quartered according to the law and usage of the day in cases of high treason chapter xi at guildhall the royal barge attended by its gorgeous fleet took its stately way down the thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats the air was laden with music the river banks were beruffled with joy flames the distant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible bonfires above it rose many a slender spire into the sky incrusted with sparkling lights wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like jewelled lances thrust aloft as the fleet swept along it was greeted from the banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless flash and boom of artillery to tom canty half buried in his silken cushions these sounds and this spectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing to his little friends at his side the princess elizabeth and the lady jane grey they were nothing arrived at the dowgate the fleet was towed up the limpid walbrook whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under acres of buildings to bucklersbury past houses and under bridges populous with merry makers and brilliantly lighted and at last came to a halt in a basin where now is barge yard in the centre of the ancient city of london tom disembarked and he and his gallant procession crossed cheapside and made a short march through the old jewry and basinghall street to the guildhall tom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the lord mayor and the fathers of the city in their gold chains and scarlet robes of state and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of the great hall preceded by heralds making proclamation and by the mace and the city sword the lords and ladies who were to attend upon tom and his two small friends took their places behind their chairs at a lower table the court grandees and other guests of noble degree were seated with the magnates of the city the commoners took places at a multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall from their lofty vantage ground the giants gog and magog the ancient guardians of the city contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar to it in forgotten generations there was a bugle blast and a proclamation and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward wall followed by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a royal baron of beef smoking hot and ready for the knife after grace tom being instructed rose and the whole house with him and drank from a portly golden loving cup with the princess elizabeth from her it passed to the lady jane and then traversed the general assemblage so the banquet began by midnight the revelry was at its height now came one of those picturesque spectacles so admired in that old day a description of it is still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it space being made presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after the turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold hats on their heads of crimson velvet with great rolls of gold girded with two swords called scimitars hanging by great bawdricks of gold next came yet another baron and another earl in two long gowns of yellow satin traversed with white satin and in every bend of white was a bend of crimson satin after the fashion of russia with furred hats of gray on their heads either of them having an hatchet in their hands and boots with pykes points a foot long turned up and after them came a knight then the lord high admiral and with him five nobles in doublets of crimson velvet voyded low on the back and before to the cannell bone laced on the breasts with chains of silver and over that short cloaks of crimson satin and on their heads hats after the dancers fashion with pheasants feathers in them these were appareled after the fashion of prussia the torchbearers which were about an hundred were appareled in crimson satin and green like moors their faces black next came in a mommarye then the minstrels which were disguised danced and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also that it was a pleasure to behold and while tom in his high seat was gazing upon this wild dancing lost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours which the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented the ragged but real little prince of wales was proclaiming his rights and his wrongs denouncing the impostor and clamouring for admission at the gates of guildhall the crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously and pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter presently they began to taunt him and mock at him purposely to goad him into a higher and still more entertaining fury tears of mortification sprang to his eyes but he stood his ground and defied the mob right royally other taunts followed added mockings stung him and he exclaimed i tell ye again you pack of unmannerly curs i am the prince of wales and all forlorn and friendless as i be with none to give me word of grace or help me in my need yet will not i be driven from my ground but will maintain it though thou be prince or no prince tis all one thou be st a gallant lad and not friendless neither here stand i by thy side to prove it and mind i tell thee thou might st have a worser friend than miles hendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking rest thy small jaw my child i talk the language of these base kennel rats like to a very native the speaker was a sort of don caesar de bazan in dress aspect and bearing he was tall trim built muscular his doublet and trunks were of rich material but faded and threadbare and their gold lace adornments were sadly tarnished his ruff was rumpled and damaged the plume in his slouched hat was broken and had a bedraggled and disreputable look at his side he wore a long rapier in a rusty iron sheath his swaggering carriage marked him at once as a ruffler of the camp the speech of this fantastic figure was received with an explosion of jeers and laughter some cried tis another prince in disguise ware thy tongue friend belike he is dangerous marry he looketh it mark his eye pluck the lad from him to the horse pond wi the cub instantly a hand was laid upon the prince under the impulse of this happy thought as instantly the strangers long sword was out and the meddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of it the next moment a score of voices shouted kill the dog kill him kill him and the mob closed in on the warrior who backed himself against a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a madman his victims sprawled this way and that but the mob tide poured over their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with undiminished fury his moments seemed numbered his destruction certain when suddenly a trumpet blast sounded a voice shouted way for the kings messenger and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob who fled out of harms reach as fast as their legs could carry them the bold stranger caught up the prince in his arms and was soon far away from danger and the multitude return we within the guildhall suddenly high above the jubilant roar and thunder of the revel broke the clear peal of a bugle note there was instant silence a deep hush then a single voice rose that of the messenger from the palace and began to pipe forth a proclamation the whole multitude standing listening the closing words solemnly pronounced were the king is dead the great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one accord remained so in profound silence a few moments then all sank upon their knees in a body stretched out their hands toward tom and a mighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the building long live the king poor toms dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle and finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him a moment then upon the earl of hertford a sudden purpose dawned in his face he said in a low tone at lord hertfords ear answer me truly on thy faith and honour uttered i here a command the which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter would such commandment be obeyed and none rise up to say me nay none my liege in all these realms in thy person bides the majesty of england thou art the king thy word is law tom responded in a strong earnest voice and with great animation then shall the kings law be law of mercy from this day and never more be law of blood up from thy knees and away to the tower and say the king decrees the duke of norfolk shall not die the words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and wide over the hall and as hertford hurried from the presence another prodigious shout burst forth the reign of blood is ended long live edward king of england chapter xii the prince and his deliverer as soon as miles hendon and the little prince were clear of the mob they struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the river their way was unobstructed until they approached london bridge then they ploughed into the multitude again hendon keeping a fast grip upon the princes no the kings wrist the tremendous news was already abroad and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once the king is dead the tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little waif and sent a shudder through his frame he realised the greatness of his loss and was filled with a bitter grief for the grim tyrant who had been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him the tears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects for an instant he felt himself the most forlorn outcast and forsaken of gods creatures then another cry shook the night with its far reaching thunders long live king edward the sixth and this made his eyes kindle and thrilled him with pride to his fingers ends ah he thought how grand and strange it seems i am king our friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon the bridge this structure which had stood for six hundred years and had been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time was a curious affair for a closely packed rank of stores and shops with family quarters overhead stretched along both sides of it from one bank of the river to the other the bridge was a sort of town to itself it had its inn its beer houses its bakeries its haberdasheries its food markets its manufacturing industries and even its church it looked upon the two neighbours which it linked together london and southwark as being well enough as suburbs but not otherwise particularly important it was a close corporation so to speak it was a narrow town of a single street a fifth of a mile long its population was but a village population and everybody in it knew all his fellow townsmen intimately and had known their fathers and mothers before them and all their little family affairs into the bargain it had its aristocracy of course its fine old families of butchers and bakers and what not who had occupied the same old premises for five or six hundred years and knew the great history of the bridge from beginning to end and all its strange legends and who always talked bridgy talk and thought bridgy thoughts and lied in a long level direct substantial bridgy way it was just the sort of population to be narrow and ignorant and self conceited children were born on the bridge were reared there grew to old age and finally died without ever having set a foot upon any part of the world but london bridge alone such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and interminable procession which moved through its street night and day with its confused roar of shouts and cries its neighings and bellowing and bleatings and its muffled thunder tramp was the one great thing in this world and themselves somehow the proprietors of it and so they were in effect at least they could exhibit it from their windows and did for a consideration whenever a returning king or hero gave it a fleeting splendour for there was no place like it for affording a long straight uninterrupted view of marching columns men born and reared upon the bridge found life unendurably dull and inane elsewhere history tells of one of these who left the bridge at the age of seventy one and retired to the country but he could only fret and toss in his bed he could not go to sleep the deep stillness was so painful so awful so oppressive when he was worn out with it at last he fled back to his old home a lean and haggard spectre and fell peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of the lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of london bridge in the times of which we are writing the bridge furnished object lessons in english history for its children namely the livid and decaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of its gateways but we digress hendons lodgings were in the little inn on the bridge as he neared the door with his small friend a rough voice said so thou rt come at last thou lt not escape again i warrant thee and if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee somewhat thou lt not keep us waiting another time mayhap and john canty put out his hand to seize the boy miles hendon stepped in the way and said not too fast friend thou art needlessly rough methinks what is the lad to thee if it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others affairs he is my son tis a lie cried the little king hotly boldly said and i believe thee whether thy small headpiece be sound or cracked my boy but whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father or no tis all one he shall not have thee to beat thee and abuse according to his threat so thou prefer to bide with me i do i do i know him not i loathe him and will die before i will go with him then tis settled and there is nought more to say we will see as to that exclaimed john canty striding past hendon to get at the boy by force shall he if thou do but touch him thou animated offal i will spit thee like a goose said hendon barring the way and laying his hand upon his sword hilt canty drew back now mark ye continued hendon i took this lad under my protection when a mob of such as thou would have mishandled him mayhap killed him dost imagine i will desert him now to a worser fate for whether thou art his father or no and sooth to say i think it is a lie a decent swift death were better for such a lad than life in such brute hands as thine so go thy ways and set quick about it for i like not much bandying of words being not over patient in my nature john canty moved off muttering threats and curses and was swallowed from sight in the crowd hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his room with his charge after ordering a meal to be sent thither it was a poor apartment with a shabby bed and some odds and ends of old furniture in it and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles the little king dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it almost exhausted with hunger and fatigue he had been on his feet a good part of a day and a night for it was now two or three o clock in the morning and had eaten nothing meantime he murmured drowsily prithee call me when the table is spread and sank into a deep sleep immediately a smile twinkled in hendons eye and he said to himself by the mass the little beggar takes to ones quarters and usurps ones bed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned them with never a by your leave or so please it you or anything of the sort in his diseased ravings he called himself the prince of wales and bravely doth he keep up the character poor little friendless rat doubtless his mind has been disordered with ill usage well i will be his friend i have saved him and it draweth me strongly to him already i love the bold tongued little rascal how soldier like he faced the smutty rabble and flung back his high defiance and what a comely sweet and gentle face he hath now that sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its griefs i will teach him i will cure his malady yea i will be his elder brother and care for him and watch over him and whoso would shame him or do him hurt may order his shroud for though i be burnt for it he shall need it he bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and pitying interest tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing back the tangled curls with his great brown hand a slight shiver passed over the boys form hendon muttered see now how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered and fill his body with deadly rheums now what shall i do twill wake him to take him up and put him within the bed and he sorely needeth sleep he looked about for extra covering but finding none doffed his doublet and wrapped the lad in it saying i am used to nipping air and scant apparel tis little i shall mind the cold then walked up and down the room to keep his blood in motion soliloquising as before his injured mind persuades him he is prince of wales twill be odd to have a prince of wales still with us now that he that was the prince is prince no more but king for this poor mind is set upon the one fantasy and will not reason out that now it should cast by the prince and call itself the king if my father liveth still after these seven years that i have heard nought from home in my foreign dungeon he will welcome the poor lad and give him generous shelter for my sake so will my good elder brother arthur my other brother hugh but i will crack his crown an he interfere the fox hearted ill conditioned animal yes thither will we fare and straightway too a servant entered with a smoking meal disposed it upon a small deal table placed the chairs and took his departure leaving such cheap lodgers as these to wait upon themselves the door slammed after him and the noise woke the boy who sprang to a sitting posture and shot a glad glance about him then a grieved look came into his face and he murmured to himself with a deep sigh alack it was but a dream woe is me next he noticed miles hendons doublet glanced from that to hendon comprehended the sacrifice that had been made for him and said gently thou art good to me yes thou art very good to me take it and put it on i shall not need it more then he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and stood there waiting hendon said in a cheery voice we ll have a right hearty sup and bite now for everything is savoury and smoking hot and that and thy nap together will make thee a little man again never fear the boy made no answer but bent a steady look that was filled with grave surprise and also somewhat touched with impatience upon the tall knight of the sword hendon was puzzled and said whats amiss good sir i would wash me oh is that all ask no permission of miles hendon for aught thou cravest make thyself perfectly free here and welcome with all that are his belongings still the boy stood and moved not more he tapped the floor once or twice with his small impatient foot hendon was wholly perplexed said he bless us what is it prithee pour the water and make not so many words hendon suppressing a horse laugh and saying to himself by all the saints but this is admirable stepped briskly forward and did the small insolents bidding then stood by in a sort of stupefaction until the command come the towel woke him sharply up he took up a towel from under the boys nose and handed it to him without comment he now proceeded to comfort his own face with a wash and while he was at it his adopted child seated himself at the table and prepared to fall to hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity then drew back the other chair and was about to place himself at table when the boy said indignantly forbear wouldst sit in the presence of the king this blow staggered hendon to his foundations he muttered to himself lo the poor things madness is up with the time it hath changed with the great change that is come to the realm and now in fancy is he king good lack i must humour the conceit too there is no other way faith he would order me to the tower else and pleased with this jest he removed the chair from the table took his stand behind the king and proceeded to wait upon him in the courtliest way he was capable of while the king ate the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a little and with his growing contentment came a desire to talk he said i think thou callest thyself miles hendon if i heard thee aright yes sire miles replied then observed to himself if i must humour the poor lads madness i must sire him i must majesty him i must not go by halves i must stick at nothing that belongeth to the part i play else shall i play it ill and work evil to this charitable and kindly cause the king warmed his heart with a second glass of wine and said i would know thee tell me thy story thou hast a gallant way with thee and a noble art nobly born we are of the tail of the nobility good your majesty my father is a baronet one of the smaller lords by knight service sir richard hendon of hendon hall by monks holm in kent the name has escaped my memory go on tell me thy story tis not much your majesty yet perchance it may beguile a short half hour for want of a better my father sir richard is very rich and of a most generous nature my mother died whilst i was yet a boy i have two brothers arthur my elder with a soul like to his fathers and hugh younger than i a mean spirit covetous treacherous vicious underhanded a reptile such was he from the cradle such was he ten years past when i last saw him a ripe rascal at nineteen i being twenty then and arthur twenty two there is none other of us but the lady edith my cousin she was sixteen then beautiful gentle good the daughter of an earl the last of her race heiress of a great fortune and a lapsed title my father was her guardian i loved her and she loved me but she was betrothed to arthur from the cradle and sir richard would not suffer the contract to be broken arthur loved another maid and bade us be of good cheer and hold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would some day give success to our several causes hugh loved the lady ediths fortune though in truth he said it was herself he loved but then twas his way alway to say the one thing and mean the other but he lost his arts upon the girl he could deceive my father but none else my father loved him best of us all and trusted and believed him for he was the youngest child and others hated him these qualities being in all ages sufficient to win a parents dearest love and he had a smooth persuasive tongue with an admirable gift of lying and these be qualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen itself i was wild in troth i might go yet farther and say very wild though twas a wildness of an innocent sort since it hurt none but me brought shame to none nor loss nor had in it any taint of crime or baseness or what might not beseem mine honourable degree yet did my brother hugh turn these faults to good account he seeing that our brother arthurs health was but indifferent and hoping the worst might work him profit were i swept out of the path so but twere a long tale good my liege and little worth the telling briefly then this brother did deftly magnify my faults and make them crimes ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in mine apartments conveyed thither by his own means and did convince my father by this and suborned evidence of servants and other lying knaves that i was minded to carry off my edith and marry with her in rank defiance of his will three years of banishment from home and england might make a soldier and a man of me my father said and teach me some degree of wisdom i fought out my long probation in the continental wars tasting sumptuously of hard knocks privation and adventure but in my last battle i was taken captive and during the seven years that have waxed and waned since then a foreign dungeon hath harboured me through wit and courage i won to the free air at last and fled hither straight and am but just arrived right poor in purse and raiment and poorer still in knowledge of what these dull seven years have wrought at hendon hall its people and belongings so please you sir my meagre tale is told thou hast been shamefully abused said the little king with a flashing eye but i will right thee by the cross will i the king hath said it then fired by the story of miless wrongs he loosed his tongue and poured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears of his astonished listener when he had finished miles said to himself lo what an imagination he hath verily this is no common mind else crazed or sane it could not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this out of the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this curious romaunt poor ruined little head it shall not lack friend or shelter whilst i bide with the living he shall never leave my side he shall be my pet my little comrade and he shall be cured ay made whole and sound then will he make himself a name and proud shall i be to say yes he is mine i took him a homeless little ragamuffin but i saw what was in him and i said his name would be heard some day behold him observe him was i right the king spoke in a thoughtful measured voice thou didst save me injury and shame perchance my life and so my crown such service demandeth rich reward name thy desire and so it be within the compass of my royal power it is thine this fantastic suggestion startled hendon out of his reverie he was about to thank the king and put the matter aside with saying he had only done his duty and desired no reward but a wiser thought came into his head and he asked leave to be silent a few moments and consider the gracious offer an idea which the king gravely approved remarking that it was best to be not too hasty with a thing of such great import miles reflected during some moments then said to himself yes that is the thing to do by any other means it were impossible to get at it and certes this hours experience has taught me twould be most wearing and inconvenient to continue it as it is yes i will propose it twas a happy accident that i did not throw the chance away then he dropped upon one knee and said my poor service went not beyond the limit of a subjects simple duty and therefore hath no merit but since your majesty is pleased to hold it worthy some reward i take heart of grace to make petition to this effect near four hundred years ago as your grace knoweth there being ill blood betwixt john king of england and the king of france it was decreed that two champions should fight together in the lists and so settle the dispute by what is called the arbitrament of god these two kings and the spanish king being assembled to witness and judge the conflict the french champion appeared but so redoubtable was he that our english knights refused to measure weapons with him so the matter which was a weighty one was like to go against the english monarch by default now in the tower lay the lord de courcy the mightiest arm in england stripped of his honours and possessions and wasting with long captivity appeal was made to him he gave assent and came forth arrayed for battle but no sooner did the frenchman glimpse his huge frame and hear his famous name but he fled away and the french kings cause was lost king john restored de courcys titles and possessions and said name thy wish and thou shalt have it though it cost me half my kingdom whereat de courcy kneeling as i do now made answer this then i ask my liege that i and my successors may have and hold the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the kings of england henceforth while the throne shall last the boon was granted as your majesty knoweth and there hath been no time these four hundred years that that line has failed of an heir and so even unto this day the head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the kings majesty without let or hindrance and this none other may do invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer i beseech the king to grant to me but this one grace and privilege to my more than sufficient reward and none other to wit that i and my heirs for ever may sit in the presence of the majesty of england rise sir miles hendon knight said the king gravely giving the accolade with hendons sword rise and seat thyself thy petition is granted whilst england remains and the crown continues the privilege shall not lapse his majesty walked apart musing and hendon dropped into a chair at table observing to himself twas a brave thought and hath wrought me a mighty deliverance my legs are grievously wearied an i had not thought of that i must have had to stand for weeks till my poor lads wits are cured after a little he went on and so i am become a knight of the kingdom of dreams and shadows a most odd and strange position truly for one so matter of fact as i i will not laugh no god forbid for this thing which is so substanceless to me is real to him and to me also in one way it is not a falsity for it reflects with truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him after a pause ah what if he should call me by my fine title before folk thered be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment but no matter let him call me what he will so it please him i shall be content chapter xiii the disappearance of the prince a heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades the king said remove these rags meaning his clothing hendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark tucked him up in bed then glanced about the room saying to himself ruefully he hath taken my bed again as before marry what shall i do the little king observed his perplexity and dissipated it with a word he said sleepily thou wilt sleep athwart the door and guard it in a moment more he was out of his troubles in a deep slumber dear heart he should have been born a king muttered hendon admiringly he playeth the part to a marvel then he stretched himself across the door on the floor saying contentedly i have lodged worse for seven years twould be but ill gratitude to him above to find fault with this he dropped asleep as the dawn appeared toward noon he rose uncovered his unconscious ward a section at a time and took his measure with a string the king awoke just as he had completed his work complained of the cold and asked what he was doing tis done now my liege said hendon i have a bit of business outside but will presently return sleep thou again thou needest it there let me cover thy head also thou lt be warm the sooner the king was back in dreamland before this speech was ended miles slipped softly out and slipped as softly in again in the course of thirty or forty minutes with a complete second hand suit of boys clothing of cheap material and showing signs of wear but tidy and suited to the season of the year he seated himself and began to overhaul his purchase mumbling to himself a longer purse would have got a better sort but when one has not the long purse one must be content with what a short one may do there was a woman in our town in our town did dwell he stirred methinks i must sing in a less thunderous key tis not good to mar his sleep with this journey before him and he so wearied out poor chap this garment tis well enough a stitch here and another one there will set it aright this other is better albeit a stitch or two will not come amiss in it likewise these be very good and sound and will keep his small feet warm and dry an odd new thing to him belike since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare winters and summers the same would thread were bread seeing one getteth a years sufficiency for a farthing and such a brave big needle without cost for mere love now shall i have the demons own time to thread it and so he had he did as men have always done and probably always will do to the end of time held the needle still and tried to thrust the thread through the eye which is the opposite of a womans way time and time again the thread missed the mark going sometimes on one side of the needle sometimes on the other sometimes doubling up against the shaft but he was patient having been through these experiences before when he was soldiering he succeeded at last and took up the garment that had lain waiting meantime across his lap and began his work the inn is paid the breakfast that is to come included and there is wherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs for the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at hendon hall she loved her hus body o me i have driven the needle under my nail it matters little tis not a novelty yet tis not a convenience neither we shall be merry there little one never doubt it thy troubles will vanish there and likewise thy sad distemper she loved her husband dearilee but another man these be noble large stitches holding the garment up and viewing it admiringly they have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause these small stingy ones of the tailor man to look mightily paltry and plebeian she loved her husband dearilee but another man he loved she marry tis done a goodly piece of work too and wrought with expedition now will i wake him apparel him pour for him feed him and then will we hie us to the mart by the tabard inn in southwark and be pleased to rise my liege he answereth not what ho my liege of a truth must i profane his sacred person with a touch sith his slumber is deaf to speech what he threw back the covers the boy was gone he stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment noticed for the first time that his wards ragged raiment was also missing then he began to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper at that moment a servant entered with the breakfast explain thou limb of satan or thy time is come roared the man of war and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter could not find his tongue for the instant for fright and surprise where is the boy in disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the information desired you were hardly gone from the place your worship when a youth came running and said it was your worships will that the boy come to you straight at the bridge end on the southwark side i brought him hither and when he woke the lad and gave his message the lad did grumble some little for being disturbed so early as he called it but straightway trussed on his rags and went with the youth only saying it had been better manners that your worship came yourself not sent a stranger and so and so thou rt a fool a fool and easily cozened hang all thy breed yet mayhap no hurt is done possibly no harm is meant the boy i will go fetch him make the table ready stay the coverings of the bed were disposed as if one lay beneath them happened that by accident i know not good your worship i saw the youth meddle with them he that came for the boy thousand deaths twas done to deceive me tis plain twas done to gain time hark ye was that youth alone all alone your worship art sure sure your worship collect thy scattered wits bethink thee take time man after a moments thought the servant said when he came none came with him but now i remember me that as the two stepped into the throng of the bridge a ruffian looking man plunged out from some near place and just as he was joining them what then out with it thundered the impatient hendon interrupting just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in and i saw no more being called by my master who was in a rage because a joint that the scrivener had ordered was forgot though i take all the saints to witness that to blame me for that miscarriage were like holding the unborn babe to judgment for sins com out of my sight idiot thy prating drives me mad hold whither art flying canst not bide still an instant went they toward southwark even so your worship for as i said before as to that detestable joint the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than art here yet and prating still vanish lest i throttle thee the servitor vanished hendon followed after him passed him and plunged down the stairs two steps at a stride muttering tis that scurvy villain that claimed he was his son i have lost thee my poor little mad master it is a bitter thought and i had come to love thee so no by book and bell not lost not lost for i will ransack the land till i find thee again poor child yonder is his breakfast and mine but i have no hunger now so let the rats have it speed speed that is the word as he wormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes upon the bridge he several times said to himself clinging to the thought as if it were a particularly pleasing one he grumbled but he went he went yes because he thought miles hendon asked it sweet lad he would ne er have done it for another i know it well chapter xiv le roi est mort vive le roi toward daylight of the same morning tom canty stirred out of a heavy sleep and opened his eyes in the dark he lay silent a few moments trying to analyse his confused thoughts and impressions and get some sort of meaning out of them then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous but guarded voice i see it all i see it all now god be thanked i am indeed awake at last come joy vanish sorrow ho nan bet kick off your straw and hie ye hither to my side till i do pour into your unbelieving ears the wildest madcap dream that ever the spirits of night did conjure up to astonish the soul of man withal ho nan i say bet a dim form appeared at his side and a voice said wilt deign to deliver thy commands commandso woe is me i know thy voice speak thou who am i thou in sooth yesternight wert thou the prince of wales to day art thou my most gracious liege edward king of england tom buried his head among his pillows murmuring plaintively alack it was no dream go to thy rest sweet sir leave me to my sorrows tom slept again and after a time he had this pleasant dream he thought it was summer and he was playing all alone in the fair meadow called goodmans fields when a dwarf only a foot high with long red whiskers and a humped back appeared to him suddenly and said dig by that stump he did so and found twelve bright new pennies wonderful riches yet this was not the best of it for the dwarf said i know thee thou art a good lad and a deserving thy distresses shall end for the day of thy reward is come dig here every seventh day and thou shalt find always the same treasure twelve bright new pennies tell none keep the secret then the dwarf vanished and tom flew to offal court with his prize saying to himself every night will i give my father a penny he will think i begged it it will glad his heart and i shall no more be beaten one penny every week the good priest that teacheth me shall have mother nan and bet the other four we be done with hunger and rags now done with fears and frets and savage usage in his dream he reached his sordid home all out of breath but with eyes dancing with grateful enthusiasm cast four of his pennies into his mothers lap and cried out they are for thee all of them every one for thee and nan and bet and honestly come by not begged nor stolen the happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and exclaimed it waxeth late may it please your majesty to rise ah that was not the answer he was expecting the dream had snapped asunder he was awake he opened his eyes the richly clad first lord of the bedchamber was kneeling by his couch the gladness of the lying dream faded away the poor boy recognised that he was still a captive and a king the room was filled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles the mourning colour and with noble servants of the monarch tom sat up in bed and gazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company the weighty business of dressing began and one courtier after another knelt and paid his court and offered to the little king his condolences upon his heavy loss whilst the dressing proceeded in the beginning a shirt was taken up by the chief equerry in waiting who passed it to the first lord of the buckhounds who passed it to the second gentleman of the bedchamber who passed it to the head ranger of windsor forest who passed it to the third groom of the stole who passed it to the chancellor royal of the duchy of lancaster who passed it to the master of the wardrobe who passed it to norroy king at arms who passed it to the constable of the tower who passed it to the chief steward of the household who passed it to the hereditary grand diaperer who passed it to the lord high admiral of england who passed it to the archbishop of canterbury who passed it to the first lord of the bedchamber who took what was left of it and put it on tom poor little wondering chap it reminded him of passing buckets at a fire each garment in its turn had to go through this slow and solemn process consequently tom grew very weary of the ceremony so weary that he felt an almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw his long silken hose begin the journey down the line and knew that the end of the matter was drawing near but he exulted too soon the first lord of the bedchamber received the hose and was about to encase toms legs in them when a sudden flush invaded his face and he hurriedly hustled the things back into the hands of the archbishop of canterbury with an astounded look and a whispered see my lord pointing to a something connected with the hose the archbishop paled then flushed and passed the hose to the lord high admiral whispering see my lord the admiral passed the hose to the hereditary grand diaperer and had hardly breath enough in his body to ejaculate see my lord the hose drifted backward along the line to the chief steward of the household the constable of the tower norroy king at arms the master of the wardrobe the chancellor royal of the duchy of lancaster the third groom of the stole the head ranger of windsor forest the second gentleman of the bedchamber the first lord of the buckhounds accompanied always with that amazed and frightened see see till they finally reached the hands of the chief equerry in waiting who gazed a moment with a pallid face upon what had caused all this dismay then hoarsely whispered body of my life a tag gone from a truss point to the tower with the head keeper of the kings hose after which he leaned upon the shoulder of the first lord of the buckhounds to regather his vanished strength whilst fresh hose without any damaged strings to them were brought but all things must have an end and so in time tom canty was in a condition to get out of bed the proper official poured water the proper official engineered the washing the proper official stood by with a towel and by and by tom got safely through the purifying stage and was ready for the services of the hairdresser royal when he at length emerged from this masters hands he was a gracious figure and as pretty as a girl in his mantle and trunks of purple satin and purple plumed cap he now moved in state toward his breakfast room through the midst of the courtly assemblage and as he passed these fell back leaving his way free and dropped upon their knees after breakfast he was conducted with regal ceremony attended by his great officers and his guard of fifty gentlemen pensioners bearing gilt battle axes to the throne room where he proceeded to transact business of state his uncle lord hertford took his stand by the throne to assist the royal mind with wise counsel the body of illustrious men named by the late king as his executors appeared to ask toms approval of certain acts of theirs rather a form and yet not wholly a form since there was no protector as yet the archbishop of canterbury made report of the decree of the council of executors concerning the obsequies of his late most illustrious majesty and finished by reading the signatures of the executors to wit the archbishop of canterbury the lord chancellor of england william lord st john john lord russell edward earl of hertford john viscount lisle cuthbert bishop of durham tom was not listening an earlier clause of the document was puzzling him at this point he turned and whispered to lord hertford what day did he say the burial hath been appointed for the sixteenth of the coming month my liege tis a strange folly will he keep poor chap he was still new to the customs of royalty he was used to seeing the forlorn dead of offal court hustled out of the way with a very different sort of expedition however the lord hertford set his mind at rest with a word or two a secretary of state presented an order of the council appointing the morrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign ambassadors and desired the kings assent tom turned an inquiring look toward hertford who whispered your majesty will signify consent they come to testify their royal masters sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited your grace and the realm of england tom did as he was bidden another secretary began to read a preamble concerning the expenses of the late kings household which had amounted to pounds during the preceding six months a sum so vast that it made tom canty gasp he gasped again when the fact appeared that pounds of this money was still owing and unpaid and once more when it appeared that the kings coffers were about empty and his twelve hundred servants much embarrassed for lack of the wages due them tom spoke out with lively apprehension we be going to the dogs tis plain tis meet and necessary that we take a smaller house and set the servants at large sith they be of no value but to make delay and trouble one with offices that harass the spirit and shame the soul they misbecoming any but a doll that hath nor brains nor hands to help itself withal i remember me of a small house that standeth over against the fish market by billingsgate a sharp pressure upon toms arm stopped his foolish tongue and sent a blush to his face but no countenance there betrayed any sign that this strange speech had been remarked or given concern a secretary made report that forasmuch as the late king had provided in his will for conferring the ducal degree upon the earl of hertford and raising his brother sir thomas seymour to the peerage and likewise hertfords son to an earldom together with similar aggrandisements to other great servants of the crown the council had resolved to hold a sitting on the th of february for the delivering and confirming of these honours and that meantime the late king not having granted in writing estates suitable to the support of these dignities the council knowing his private wishes in that regard had thought proper to grant to seymour pound lands and to hertfords son pound lands and pound of the next bishops lands which should fall vacant his present majesty being willing tom was about to blurt out something about the propriety of paying the late kings debts first before squandering all this money but a timely touch upon his arm from the thoughtful hertford saved him this indiscretion wherefore he gave the royal assent without spoken comment but with much inward discomfort while he sat reflecting a moment over the ease with which he was doing strange and glittering miracles a happy thought shot into his mind why not make his mother duchess of offal court and give her an estate but a sorrowful thought swept it instantly away he was only a king in name these grave veterans and great nobles were his masters to them his mother was only the creature of a diseased mind they would simply listen to his project with unbelieving ears then send for the doctor the dull work went tediously on petitions were read and proclamations patents and all manner of wordy repetitious and wearisome papers relating to the public business and at last tom sighed pathetically and murmured to himself in what have i offended that the good god should take me away from the fields and the free air and the sunshine to shut me up here and make me a king and afflict me so then his poor muddled head nodded a while and presently drooped to his shoulder and the business of the empire came to a standstill for want of that august factor the ratifying power silence ensued around the slumbering child and the sages of the realm ceased from their deliberations during the forenoon tom had an enjoyable hour by permission of his keepers hertford and st john with the lady elizabeth and the little lady jane grey though the spirits of the princesses were rather subdued by the mighty stroke that had fallen upon the royal house and at the end of the visit his elder sister afterwards the bloody mary of history chilled him with a solemn interview which had but one merit in his eyes its brevity he had a few moments to himself and then a slim lad of about twelve years of age was admitted to his presence whose clothing except his snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists was of black doublet hose and all he bore no badge of mourning but a knot of purple ribbon on his shoulder he advanced hesitatingly with head bowed and bare and dropped upon one knee in front of tom tom sat still and contemplated him soberly a moment then he said rise lad who art thou what wouldst have the boy rose and stood at graceful ease but with an aspect of concern in his face he said of a surety thou must remember me my lord i am thy whipping boy my whipping boy the same your grace i am humphrey humphrey marlow tom perceived that here was someone whom his keepers ought to have posted him about the situation was delicate what should he do pretend he knew this lad and then betray by his every utterance that he had never heard of him before no that would not do an idea came to his relief accidents like this might be likely to happen with some frequency now that business urgencies would often call hertford and st john from his side they being members of the council of executors therefore perhaps it would be well to strike out a plan himself to meet the requirements of such emergencies yes that would be a wise course he would practise on this boy and see what sort of success he might achieve so he stroked his brow perplexedly a moment or two and presently said now i seem to remember thee somewhat but my wit is clogged and dim with suffering alack my poor master ejaculated the whipping boy with feeling adding to himself in truth tis as they said his mind is gone alas poor soul but misfortune catch me how am i forgetting they said one must not seem to observe that aught is wrong with him tis strange how my memory doth wanton with me these days said tom but mind it not i mend apace a little clue doth often serve to bring me back again the things and names which had escaped me and not they only forsooth but e en such as i ne er heard before as this lad shall see give thy business speech tis matter of small weight my liege yet will i touch upon it an it please your grace two days gone by when your majesty faulted thrice in your greek in the morning lessons dost remember it y e s methinks i do it is not much of a lie an i had meddled with the greek at all i had not faulted simply thrice but forty times yes i do recall it now go on the master being wroth with what he termed such slovenly and doltish work did promise that he would soundly whip me for it and whip thee said tom astonished out of his presence of mind why should he whip thee for faults of mine ah your grace forgetteth again he always scourgeth me when thou dost fail in thy lessons true true i had forgot thou teachest me in private then if i fail he argueth that thy office was lamely done and oh my liege what words are these i the humblest of thy servants presume to teach thee then where is thy blame what riddle is this am i in truth gone mad or is it thou explain speak out but good your majesty theres nought that needeth simplifying none may visit the sacred person of the prince of wales with blows wherefore when he faulteth tis i that take them and meet it is and right for that it is mine office and my livelihood tom stared at the tranquil boy observing to himself lo it is a wonderful thing a most strange and curious trade i marvel they have not hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for me would heaven they would an they will do this thing i will take my lashings in mine own person giving god thanks for the change then he said aloud and hast thou been beaten poor friend according to the promise no good your majesty my punishment was appointed for this day and peradventure it may be annulled as unbefitting the season of mourning that is come upon us i know not and so have made bold to come hither and remind your grace about your gracious promise to intercede in my behalf with the master to save thee thy whipping ah thou dost remember my memory mendeth thou seest set thy mind at ease thy back shall go unscathed i will see to it oh thanks my good lord cried the boy dropping upon his knee again mayhap i have ventured far enow and yet seeing master humphrey hesitate tom encouraged him to go on saying he was in the granting mood then will i speak it out for it lieth near my heart sith thou art no more prince of wales but king thou canst order matters as thou wilt with none to say thee nay wherefore it is not in reason that thou wilt longer vex thyself with dreary studies but wilt burn thy books and turn thy mind to things less irksome then am i ruined and mine orphan sisters with me ruined prithee how my back is my breado my gracious liege if it go idle i starve an thou cease from study mine office is gone thou lt need no whipping boy do not turn me away tom was touched with this pathetic distress he said with a right royal burst of generosity discomfort thyself no further lad thine office shall be permanent in thee and thy line for ever then he struck the boy a light blow on the shoulder with the flat of his sword exclaiming rise humphrey marlow hereditary grand whipping boy to the royal house of england banish sorrow i will betake me to my books again and study so ill that they must in justice treble thy wage so mightily shall the business of thine office be augmented the grateful humphrey responded fervidly thankso most noble master this princely lavishness doth far surpass my most distempered dreams of fortune now shall i be happy all my days and all the house of marlow after me tom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be useful to him he encouraged humphrey to talk and he was nothing loath he was delighted to believe that he was helping in toms cure for always as soon as he had finished calling back to toms diseased mind the various particulars of his experiences and adventures in the royal school room and elsewhere about the palace he noticed that tom was then able to recall the circumstances quite clearly at the end of an hour tom found himself well freighted with very valuable information concerning personages and matters pertaining to the court so he resolved to draw instruction from this source daily and to this end he would give order to admit humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might come provided the majesty of england was not engaged with other people humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my lord hertford arrived with more trouble for tom he said that the lords of the council fearing that some overwrought report of the kings damaged health might have leaked out and got abroad they deemed it wise and best that his majesty should begin to dine in public after a day or two his wholesome complexion and vigorous step assisted by a carefully guarded repose of manner and ease and grace of demeanour would more surely quiet the general pulse in case any evil rumours had gone about than any other scheme that could be devised then the earl proceeded very delicately to instruct tom as to the observances proper to the stately occasion under the rather thin disguise of reminding him concerning things already known to him but to his vast gratification it turned out that tom needed very little help in this line he had been making use of humphrey in that direction for humphrey had mentioned that within a few days he was to begin to dine in public having gathered it from the swift winged gossip of the court tom kept these facts to himself however seeing the royal memory so improved the earl ventured to apply a few tests to it in an apparently casual way to find out how far its amendment had progressed the results were happy here and there in spots spots where humphreys tracks remained and on the whole my lord was greatly pleased and encouraged so encouraged was he indeed that he spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice now am i persuaded that if your majesty will but tax your memory yet a little further it will resolve the puzzle of the great seal a loss which was of moment yesterday although of none to day since its term of service ended with our late lords life may it please your grace to make the trial tom was at sea a great seal was something which he was totally unacquainted with after a moments hesitation he looked up innocently and asked what was it like my lord the earl started almost imperceptibly muttering to himself alack his wits are flown again it was ill wisdom to lead him on to strain them then he deftly turned the talk to other matters with the purpose of sweeping the unlucky seal out of toms thoughts a purpose which easily succeeded chapter xv tom as king the next day the foreign ambassadors came with their gorgeous trains and tom throned in awful state received them the splendours of the scene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first but the audience was long and dreary and so were most of the addresses wherefore what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and home sickness by and by tom said the words which hertford put into his mouth from time to time and tried hard to acquit himself satisfactorily but he was too new to such things and too ill at ease to accomplish more than a tolerable success he looked sufficiently like a king but he was ill able to feel like one he was cordially glad when the ceremony was ended the larger part of his day was wasted as he termed it in his own mind in labours pertaining to his royal office even the two hours devoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a burden to him than otherwise they were so fettered by restrictions and ceremonious observances however he had a private hour with his whipping boy which he counted clear gain since he got both entertainment and needful information out of it the third day of tom cantys kingship came and went much as the others had done but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way he felt less uncomfortable than at first he was getting a little used to his circumstances and surroundings his chains still galled but not all the time he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and embarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over his head but for one single dread he could have seen the fourth day approach without serious distress the dining in public it was to begin that day there were greater matters in the programme for on that day he would have to preside at a council which would take his views and commands concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign nations scattered far and near over the great globe on that day too hertford would be formally chosen to the grand office of lord protector other things of note were appointed for that fourth day also but to tom they were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all by himself with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a multitude of mouths whispering comments upon his performance and upon his mistakes if he should be so unlucky as to make any still nothing could stop that fourth day and so it came it found poor tom low spirited and absent minded and this mood continued he could not shake it off the ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon his hands and wearied him once more he felt the sense of captivity heavy upon him late in the forenoon he was in a large audience chamber conversing with the earl of hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour appointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great officials and courtiers after a little while tom who had wandered to a window and become interested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the palace gates and not idly interested but longing with all his heart to take part in person in its stir and freedom saw the van of a hooting and shouting mob of disorderly men women and children of the lowest and poorest degree approaching from up the road i would i knew what tis about he exclaimed with all a boys curiosity in such happenings thou art the king solemnly responded the earl with a reverence have i your graces leave to act o blithely yeso gladly yes exclaimed tom excitedly adding to himself with a lively sense of satisfaction in truth being a king is not all dreariness it hath its compensations and conveniences the earl called a page and sent him to the captain of the guard with the order let the mob be halted and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its movement by the kings command a few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards cased in flashing steel filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front of the multitude a messenger returned to report that the crowd were following a man a woman and a young girl to execution for crimes committed against the peace and dignity of the realm death and a violent death for these poor unfortunates the thought wrung toms heart strings the spirit of compassion took control of him to the exclusion of all other considerations he never thought of the offended laws or of the grief or loss which these three criminals had inflicted upon their victims he could think of nothing but the scaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned his concern made him even forget for the moment that he was but the false shadow of a king not the substance and before he knew it he had blurted out the command bring them here then he blushed scarlet and a sort of apology sprung to his lips but observing that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the earl or the waiting page he suppressed the words he was about to utter the page in the most matter of course way made a profound obeisance and retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command tom experienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating advantages of the kingly office he said to himself truly it is like what i was used to feel when i read the old priests tales and did imagine mine own self a prince giving law and command to all saying do this do that whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my will now the doors swung open one high sounding title after another was announced the personages owning them followed and the place was quickly half filled with noble folk and finery but tom was hardly conscious of the presence of these people so wrought up was he and so intensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter he seated himself absently in his chair of state and turned his eyes upon the door with manifestations of impatient expectancy seeing which the company forbore to trouble him and fell to chatting a mixture of public business and court gossip one with another in a little while the measured tread of military men was heard approaching and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an under sheriff and escorted by a detail of the kings guard the civil officer knelt before tom then stood aside the three doomed persons knelt also and remained so the guard took position behind toms chair tom scanned the prisoners curiously something about the dress or appearance of the man had stirred a vague memory in him methinks i have seen this man ere now but the when or the where fail me such was toms thought just then the man glanced quickly up and quickly dropped his face again not being able to endure the awful port of sovereignty but the one full glimpse of the face which tom got was sufficient he said to himself now is the matter clear this is the stranger that plucked giles witt out of the thames and saved his life that windy bitter first day of the new year a brave good deed pity he hath been doing baser ones and got himself in this sad case i have not forgot the day neither the hour by reason that an hour after upon the stroke of eleven i did get a hiding by the hand of gammer canty which was of so goodly and admired severity that all that went before or followed after it were but fondlings and caresses by comparison tom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence for a little time then addressed himself to the under sheriff saying good sir what is this mans offence the officer knelt and answered so please your majesty he hath taken the life of a subject by poison toms compassion for the prisoner and admiration of him as the daring rescuer of a drowning boy experienced a most damaging shock the thing was proven upon him he asked most clearly sire tom sighed and said take him away he hath earned his death tis a pity for he was a brave heart na na i mean he hath the look of it the prisoner clasped his hands together with sudden energy and wrung them despairingly at the same time appealing imploringly to the king in broken and terrified phrases o my lord the king an thou canst pity the lost have pity upon me i am innocent neither hath that wherewith i am charged been more than but lamely proved yet i speak not of that the judgment is gone forth against me and may not suffer alteration yet in mine extremity i beg a boon for my doom is more than i can bear a grace a grace my lord the king in thy royal compassion grant my prayer give commandment that i be hanged tom was amazed this was not the outcome he had looked for odds my life a strange boon was it not the fate intended thee o good my liege not so it is ordered that i be boiled alive the hideous surprise of these words almost made tom spring from his chair as soon as he could recover his wits he cried out have thy wish poor soul an thou had poisoned a hundred men thou shouldst not suffer so miserable a death the prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into passionate expressions of gratitude ending with if ever thou shouldst know misfortune which god forefend may thy goodness to me this day be remembered and requited tom turned to the earl of hertford and said my lord is it believable that there was warrant for this mans ferocious doom it is the law your grace for poisoners in germany coiners be boiled to death in oil not cast in of a sudden but by a rope let down into the oil by degrees and slowly first the feet then the legs then o prithee no more my lord i cannot bear it cried tom covering his eyes with his hands to shut out the picture i beseech your good lordship that order be taken to change this law oh let no more poor creatures be visited with its tortures the earls face showed profound gratification for he was a man of merciful and generous impulses a thing not very common with his class in that fierce age he said these your graces noble words have sealed its doom history will remember it to the honour of your royal house the under sheriff was about to remove his prisoner tom gave him a sign to wait then he said good sir i would look into this matter further the man has said his deed was but lamely proved tell me what thou knowest if the kings grace please it did appear upon the trial that this man entered into a house in the hamlet of islington where one lay sick three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the morning and two say it was some minutes later the sick man being alone at the time and sleeping and presently the man came forth again and went his way the sick man died within the hour being torn with spasms and retchings did any see the poison given was poison found marry no my liege then how doth one know there was poison given at all please your majesty the doctors testified that none die with such symptoms but by poison weighty evidence this in that simple age tom recognised its formidable nature and said the doctor knoweth his trade belike they were right the matter hath an ill look for this poor man yet was not this all your majesty there is more and worse many testified that a witch since gone from the village none know whither did foretell and speak it privately in their ears that the sick man would die by poison and more that a stranger would give it a stranger with brown hair and clothed in a worn and common garb and surely this prisoner doth answer woundily to the bill please your majesty to give the circumstance that solemn weight which is its due seeing it was foretold this was an argument of tremendous force in that superstitious day tom felt that the thing was settled if evidence was worth anything this poor fellows guilt was proved still he offered the prisoner a chance saying if thou canst say aught in thy behalf speak nought that will avail my king i am innocent yet cannot i make it appear i have no friends else might i show that i was not in islington that day so also might i show that at that hour they name i was above a league away seeing i was at wapping old stairs yea more my king for i could show that whilst they say i was taking life i was saving it a drowning boy peace sheriff name the day the deed was done at ten in the morning or some minutes later the first day of the new year most illustrious let the prisoner go free it is the kings will another blush followed this unregal outburst and he covered his indecorum as well as he could by adding it enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle hare brained evidence a low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage it was not admiration of the decree that had been delivered by tom for the propriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner was a thing which few there would have felt justified in either admitting or admiring no the admiration was for the intelligence and spirit which tom had displayed some of the low voiced remarks were to this effect this is no mad king he hath his wits sound how sanely he put his questions how like his former natural self was this abrupt imperious disposal of the matter god be thanked his infirmity is spent this is no weakling but a king he hath borne himself like to his own father the air being filled with applause toms ear necessarily caught a little of it the effect which this had upon him was to put him greatly at his ease and also to charge his system with very gratifying sensations however his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these pleasant thoughts and feelings he was eager to know what sort of deadly mischief the woman and the little girl could have been about so by his command the two terrified and sobbing creatures were brought before him what is it that these have done he inquired of the sheriff please your majesty a black crime is charged upon them and clearly proven wherefore the judges have decreed according to the law that they be hanged they sold themselves to the devil such is their crime tom shuddered he had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked thing still he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding his curiosity for all that so he asked where was this done and when on a midnight in december in a ruined church your majesty tom shuddered again who was there present only these two your grace and that other have these confessed nay not so sire they do deny it then prithee how was it known certain witness did see them wending thither good your majesty this bred the suspicion and dire effects have since confirmed and justified it in particular it is in evidence that through the wicked power so obtained they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the region round about above forty witnesses have proved the storm and sooth one might have had a thousand for all had reason to remember it sith all had suffered by it certes this is a serious matter tom turned this dark piece of scoundrelism over in his mind a while then asked suffered the woman also by the storm several old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of the wisdom of this question the sheriff however saw nothing consequential in the inquiry he answered with simple directness indeed did she your majesty and most righteously as all aver her habitation was swept away and herself and child left shelterless methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought she had been cheated had she paid but a farthing for it that she paid her soul and her childs argueth that she is mad if she is mad she knoweth not what she doth therefore sinneth not the elderly heads nodded recognition of toms wisdom once more and one individual murmured an the king be mad himself according to report then is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some i wot of if by the gentle providence of god they could but catch it what age hath the child asked tom nine years please your majesty by the law of england may a child enter into covenant and sell itself my lord asked tom turning to a learned judge the law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty matter good my liege holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope with the riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders the devil may buy a child if he so choose and the child agree thereto but not an englishman in this latter case the contract would be null and void it seemeth a rude unchristian thing and ill contrived that english law denieth privileges to englishmen to waste them on the devil cried tom with honest heat this novel view of the matter excited many smiles and was stored away in many heads to be repeated about the court as evidence of toms originality as well as progress toward mental health the elder culprit had ceased from sobbing and was hanging upon toms words with an excited interest and a growing hope tom noticed this and it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and unfriended situation presently he asked how wrought they to bring the storm by pulling off their stockings sire this astonished tom and also fired his curiosity to fever heat he said eagerly it is wonderful hath it always this dread effect always my liege at least if the woman desire it and utter the needful words either in her mind or with her tongue tom turned to the woman and said with impetuous zeal exert thy power i would see a storm there was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage and a general though unexpressed desire to get out of the place all of which was lost upon tom who was dead to everything but the proposed cataclysm seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the womans face he added excitedly never fear thou shalt be blameless more thou shalt go free none shall touch thee exert thy power oh my lord the king i have it not i have been falsely accused thy fears stay thee be of good heart thou shalt suffer no harm make a storm it mattereth not how small a one i require nought great or harmful but indeed prefer the opposite do this and thy life is spared thou shalt go out free with thy child bearing the kings pardon and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm the woman prostrated herself and protested with tears that she had no power to do the miracle else she would gladly win her childs life alone and be content to lose her own if by obedience to the kings command so precious a grace might be acquired tom urged the woman still adhered to her declarations finally he said i think the woman hath said true an my mother were in her place and gifted with the devils functions she had not stayed a moment to call her storms and lay the whole land in ruins if the saving of my forfeit life were the price she got it is argument that other mothers are made in like mould thou art free goodwife thou and thy child for i do think thee innocent now thou st nought to fear being pardoned pull off thy stockings an thou canst make me a storm thou shalt be rich the redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude and proceeded to obey whilst tom looked on with eager expectancy a little marred by apprehension the courtiers at the same time manifesting decided discomfort and uneasiness the woman stripped her own feet and her little girls also and plainly did her best to reward the kings generosity with an earthquake but it was all a failure and a disappointment tom sighed and said there good soul trouble thyself no further thy power is departed out of thee go thy way in peace and if it return to thee at any time forget me not but fetch me a storm chapter xvi the state dinner the dinner hour drew near yet strangely enough the thought brought but slight discomfort to tom and hardly any terror the mornings experiences had wonderfully built up his confidence the poor little ash cat was already more wonted to his strange garret after four days habit than a mature person could have become in a full month a childs facility in accommodating itself to circumstances was never more strikingly illustrated let us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting room and have a glance at matters there whilst tom is being made ready for the imposing occasion it is a spacious apartment with gilded pillars and pilasters and pictured walls and ceilings at the door stand tall guards as rigid as statues dressed in rich and picturesque costumes and bearing halberds in a high gallery which runs all around the place is a band of musicians and a packed company of citizens of both sexes in brilliant attire in the centre of the room upon a raised platform is toms table now let the ancient chronicler speak a gentleman enters the room bearing a rod and along with him another bearing a tablecloth which after they have both kneeled three times with the utmost veneration he spreads upon the table and after kneeling again they both retire then come two others one with the rod again the other with a salt cellar a plate and bread when they have kneeled as the others had done and placed what was brought upon the table they too retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first at last come two nobles richly clothed one bearing a tasting knife who after prostrating themselves three times in the most graceful manner approach and rub the table with bread and salt with as much awe as if the king had been present so end the solemn preliminaries now far down the echoing corridors we hear a bugle blast and the indistinct cry place for the king way for the kings most excellent majesty these sounds are momently repeated they grow nearer and nearer and presently almost in our faces the martial note peals and the cry rings out way for the king at this instant the shining pageant appears and files in at the door with a measured march let the chronicler speak again first come gentlemen barons earls knights of the garter all richly dressed and bareheaded next comes the chancellor between two one of which carries the royal sceptre the other the sword of state in a red scabbard studded with golden fleurs de lis the point upwards next comes the king himself whom upon his appearing twelve trumpets and many drums salute with a great burst of welcome whilst all in the galleries rise in their places crying god save the king after him come nobles attached to his person and on his right and left march his guard of honour his fifty gentlemen pensioners with gilt battle axes this was all fine and pleasant toms pulse beat high and a glad light was in his eye he bore himself right gracefully and all the more so because he was not thinking of how he was doing it his mind being charmed and occupied with the blithe sights and sounds about him and besides nobody can be very ungraceful in nicely fitting beautiful clothes after he has grown a little used to them especially if he is for the moment unconscious of them tom remembered his instructions and acknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head and a courteous i thank ye my good people he seated himself at table without removing his cap and did it without the least embarrassment for to eat with ones cap on was the one solitary royal custom upon which the kings and the cantys met upon common ground neither party having any advantage over the other in the matter of old familiarity with it the pageant broke up and grouped itself picturesquely and remained bareheaded now to the sound of gay music the yeomen of the guard entered the tallest and mightiest men in england they being carefully selected in this regard but we will let the chronicler tell about it the yeomen of the guard entered bareheaded clothed in scarlet with golden roses upon their backs and these went and came bringing in each turn a course of dishes served in plate these dishes were received by a gentleman in the same order they were brought and placed upon the table while the taster gave to each guard a mouthful to eat of the particular dish he had brought for fear of any poison tom made a good dinner notwithstanding he was conscious that hundreds of eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him eat it with an interest which could not have been more intense if it had been a deadly explosive and was expected to blow him up and scatter him all about the place he was careful not to hurry and equally careful not to do anything whatever for himself but wait till the proper official knelt down and did it for him he got through without a mistake flawless and precious triumph when the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst of his bright pageant with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles rolling drums and thundering acclamations he felt that if he had seen the worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad to endure several times a day if by that means he could but buy himself free from some of the more formidable requirements of his royal office chapter xvii foo foo the first miles hendon hurried along toward the southwark end of the bridge keeping a sharp look out for the persons he sought and hoping and expecting to overtake them presently he was disappointed in this however by asking questions he was enabled to track them part of the way through southwark then all traces ceased and he was perplexed as to how to proceed still he continued his efforts as best he could during the rest of the day nightfall found him leg weary half famished and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever so he supped at the tabard inn and went to bed resolved to make an early start in the morning and give the town an exhaustive search as he lay thinking and planning he presently began to reason thus the boy would escape from the ruffian his reputed father if possible would he go back to london and seek his former haunts no he would not do that he would avoid recapture what then would he do never having had a friend in the world or a protector until he met miles hendon he would naturally try to find that friend again provided the effort did not require him to go toward london and danger he would strike for hendon hall that is what he would do for he knew hendon was homeward bound and there he might expect to find him yes the case was plain to hendon he must lose no more time in southwark but move at once through kent toward monks holm searching the wood and inquiring as he went let us return to the vanished little king now the ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw about to join the youth and the king did not exactly join them but fell in close behind them and followed their steps he said nothing his left arm was in a sling and he wore a large green patch over his left eye he limped slightly and used an oaken staff as a support the youth led the king a crooked course through southwark and by and by struck into the high road beyond the king was irritated now and said he would stop here it was hendons place to come to him not his to go to hendon he would not endure such insolence he would stop where he was the youth said thou lt tarry here and thy friend lying wounded in the wood yonder so be it then the kings manner changed at once he cried out wounded and who hath dared to do it but that is apart lead on lead on faster sirrah art shod with lead wounded is he now though the doer of it be a dukes son he shall rue it it was some distance to the wood but the space was speedily traversed the youth looked about him discovered a bough sticking in the ground with a small bit of rag tied to it then led the way into the forest watching for similar boughs and finding them at intervals they were evidently guides to the point he was aiming at by and by an open place was reached where were the charred remains of a farm house and near them a barn which was falling to ruin and decay there was no sign of life anywhere and utter silence prevailed the youth entered the barn the king following eagerly upon his heels no one there the king shot a surprised and suspicious glance at the youth and asked where is he a mocking laugh was his answer the king was in a rage in a moment he seized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging upon the youth when another mocking laugh fell upon his ear it was from the lame ruffian who had been following at a distance the king turned and said angrily who art thou what is thy business here leave thy foolery said the man and quiet thyself my disguise is none so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through it thou art not my father i know thee not i am the king if thou hast hid my servant find him for me or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou hast done john canty replied in a stern and measured voice it is plain thou art mad and i am loath to punish thee but if thou provoke me i must thy prating doth no harm here where there are no ears that need to mind thy follies yet it is well to practise thy tongue to wary speech that it may do no hurt when our quarters change i have done a murder and may not tarry at home neither shalt thou seeing i need thy service my name is changed for wise reasons it is hobbs john hobbs thine is jack charge thy memory accordingly now then speak where is thy mother where are thy sisters they came not to the place appointed knowest thou whither they went the king answered sullenly trouble me not with these riddles my mother is dead my sisters are in the palace the youth near by burst into a derisive laugh and the king would have assaulted him but canty or hobbs as he now called himself prevented him and said peace hugo vex him not his mind is astray and thy ways fret him sit thee down jack and quiet thyself thou shalt have a morsel to eat anon hobbs and hugo fell to talking together in low voices and the king removed himself as far as he could from their disagreeable company he withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of the barn where he found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with straw he lay down here drew straw over himself in lieu of blankets and was soon absorbed in thinking he had many griefs but the minor ones were swept almost into forgetfulness by the supreme one the loss of his father to the rest of the world the name of henry viii brought a shiver and suggested an ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand dealt scourgings and death but to this boy the name brought only sensations of pleasure the figure it invoked wore a countenance that was all gentleness and affection he called to mind a long succession of loving passages between his father and himself and dwelt fondly upon them his unstinted tears attesting how deep and real was the grief that possessed his heart as the afternoon wasted away the lad wearied with his troubles sank gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber after a considerable time he could not tell how long his senses struggled to a half consciousness and as he lay with closed eyes vaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening he noted a murmurous sound the sullen beating of rain upon the roof a snug sense of comfort stole over him which was rudely broken the next moment by a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter it startled him disagreeably and he unmuffled his head to see whence this interruption proceeded a grim and unsightly picture met his eye a bright fire was burning in the middle of the floor at the other end of the barn and around it and lit weirdly up by the red glare lolled and sprawled the motliest company of tattered gutter scum and ruffians of both sexes he had ever read or dreamed of there were huge stalwart men brown with exposure long haired and clothed in fantastic rags there were middle sized youths of truculent countenance and similarly clad there were blind mendicants with patched or bandaged eyes crippled ones with wooden legs and crutches diseased ones with running sores peeping from ineffectual wrappings there was a villain looking pedlar with his pack a knife grinder a tinker and a barber surgeon with the implements of their trades some of the females were hardly grown girls some were at prime some were old and wrinkled hags and all were loud brazen foul mouthed and all soiled and slatternly there were three sore faced babies there were a couple of starveling curs with strings about their necks whose office was to lead the blind the night was come the gang had just finished feasting an orgy was beginning the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth a general cry broke forth a song a song from the bat and dick and dot and go one one of the blind men got up and made ready by casting aside the patches that sheltered his excellent eyes and the pathetic placard which recited the cause of his calamity dot and go one disencumbered himself of his timber leg and took his place upon sound and healthy limbs beside his fellow rascal then they roared out a rollicking ditty and were reinforced by the whole crew at the end of each stanza in a rousing chorus by the time the last stanza was reached the half drunken enthusiasm had risen to such a pitch that everybody joined in and sang it clear through from the beginning producing a volume of villainous sound that made the rafters quake these were the inspiring words bien darkmans then bouse mort and ken the bien coves bings awast on chates to trine by rome coves dine for his long lib at last bingd out bien morts and toure and toure bing out of the rome vile bine and toure the cove that cloyd your duds upon the chates to trine from the english rogue london conversation followed not in the thieves dialect of the song for that was only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be listening in the course of it it appeared that john hobbs was not altogether a new recruit but had trained in the gang at some former time his later history was called for and when he said he had accidentally killed a man considerable satisfaction was expressed when he added that the man was a priest he was roundly applauded and had to take a drink with everybody old acquaintances welcomed him joyously and new ones were proud to shake him by the hand he was asked why he had tarried away so many months he answered london is better than the country and safer these late years the laws be so bitter and so diligently enforced an i had not had that accident i had stayed there i had resolved to stay and never more venture country wards but the accident has ended that he inquired how many persons the gang numbered now the ruffler or chief answered five and twenty sturdy budges bulks files clapperdogeons and maunders counting the dells and doxies and other morts most are here the rest are wandering eastward along the winter lay we follow at dawn i do not see the wen among the honest folk about me where may he be poor lad his diet is brimstone now and over hot for a delicate taste he was killed in a brawl somewhere about midsummer i sorrow to hear that the wen was a capable man and brave that was he truly black bess his dell is of us yet but absent on the eastward tramp a fine lass of nice ways and orderly conduct none ever seeing her drunk above four days in the seven she was ever strict i remember it well a goodly wench and worthy all commendation her mother was more free and less particular a troublesome and ugly tempered beldame but furnished with a wit above the common we lost her through it her gift of palmistry and other sorts of fortune telling begot for her at last a witchs name and fame the law roasted her to death at a slow fire it did touch me to a sort of tenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot cursing and reviling all the crowd that gaped and gazed around her whilst the flames licked upward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about her old gray head cursing them why an thou should st live a thousand years thoud st never hear so masterful a cursing alack her art died with her there be base and weakling imitations left but no true blasphemy the ruffler sighed the listeners sighed in sympathy a general depression fell upon the company for a moment for even hardened outcasts like these are not wholly dead to sentiment but are able to feel a fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals and under peculiarly favouring circumstances as in cases like to this for instance when genius and culture depart and leave no heir however a deep drink all round soon restored the spirits of the mourners have any others of our friends fared hardly asked hobbs some yes particularly new comers such as small husbandmen turned shiftless and hungry upon the world because their farms were taken from them to be changed to sheep ranges they begged and were whipped at the carts tail naked from the girdle up till the blood ran then set in the stocks to be pelted they begged again were whipped again and deprived of an ear they begged a third time poor devils what else could they do and were branded on the cheek with a red hot iron then sold for slaves they ran away were hunted down and hanged tis a brief tale and quickly told others of us have fared less hardly stand forth yokel burns and hodge show your adornments these stood up and stripped away some of their rags exposing their backs criss crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash one turned up his hair and showed the place where a left ear had once been another showed a brand upon his shoulder the letter v and a mutilated ear the third said i am yokel once a farmer and prosperous with loving wife and kids now am i somewhat different in estate and calling and the wife and kids are gone mayhap they are in heaven mayhap in in the other place but the kindly god be thanked they bide no more in england my good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick one of these died the doctors knew not how so my mother was burnt for a witch whilst my babes looked on and wailed english law up all with your cups now all together and with a cheer drink to the merciful english law that delivered her from the english hell thank you mates one and all i begged from house to house i and the wife bearing with us the hungry kids but it was crime to be hungry in england so they stripped us and lashed us through three towns drink ye all again to the merciful english law for its lash drank deep of my marys blood and its blessed deliverance came quick she lies there in the potters field safe from all harms and the kids well whilst the law lashed me from town to town they starved drink lads only a drop a drop to the poor kids that never did any creature harm i begged again begged for a crust and got the stocks and lost an ear see here bides the stump i begged again and here is the stump of the other to keep me minded of it and still i begged again and was sold for a slave here on my cheek under this stain if i washed it off ye might see the red s the branding iron left there a slave do you understand that word an english slave that is he that stands before ye i have run from my master and when i am found the heavy curse of heaven fall on the law of the land that hath commanded it i shall hang a ringing voice came through the murky air thou shalt not and this day the end of that law is come all turned and saw the fantastic figure of the little king approaching hurriedly as it emerged into the light and was clearly revealed a general explosion of inquiries broke out who is it what is it who art thou manikin the boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and questioning eyes and answered with princely dignity i am edward king of england a wild burst of laughter followed partly of derision and partly of delight in the excellence of the joke the king was stung he said sharply ye mannerless vagrants is this your recognition of the royal boon i have promised he said more with angry voice and excited gesture but it was lost in a whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations john hobbs made several attempts to make himself heard above the din and at last succeeded saying mates he is my son a dreamer a fool and stark mad mind him not he thinketh he is the king i am the king said edward turning toward him as thou shalt know to thy cost in good time thou hast confessed a murder thou shalt swing for it thou lt betray me thou an i get my hands upon thee tut tut said the burley ruffler interposing in time to save the king and emphasising this service by knocking hobbs down with his fist hast respect for neither kings nor rufflers an thou insult my presence so again i ll hang thee up myself then he said to his majesty thou must make no threats against thy mates lad and thou must guard thy tongue from saying evil of them elsewhere be king if it please thy mad humour but be not harmful in it sink the title thou hast uttered tis treason we be bad men in some few trifling ways but none among us is so base as to be traitor to his king we be loving and loyal hearts in that regard note if i speak truth now all together long live edward king of england long live edward king of england the response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew that the crazy building vibrated to the sound the little kings face lighted with pleasure for an instant and he slightly inclined his head and said with grave simplicity i thank you my good people this unexpected result threw the company into convulsions of merriment when something like quiet was presently come again the ruffler said firmly but with an accent of good nature drop it boy tis not wise nor well humour thy fancy if thou must but choose some other title a tinker shrieked out a suggestion foo foo the first king of the mooncalves the title took at once every throat responded and a roaring shout went up of long live foo foo the first king of the mooncalves followed by hootings cat calls and peals of laughter hale him forth and crown him robe him sceptre him throne him these and twenty other cries broke out at once and almost before the poor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned with a tin basin robed in a tattered blanket throned upon a barrel and sceptred with the tinkers soldering iron then all flung themselves upon their knees about him and sent up a chorus of ironical wailings and mocking supplications whilst they swabbed their eyes with their soiled and ragged sleeves and aprons be gracious to uso sweet king trample not upon thy beseeching wormso noble majesty pity thy slaves and comfort them with a royal kick cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rayso flaming sun of sovereignty sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot that we may eat the dirt and be ennobled deign to spit upon uso sire that our childrens children may tell of thy princely condescension and be proud and happy for ever but the humorous tinker made the hit of the evening and carried off the honours kneeling he pretended to kiss the kings foot and was indignantly spurned whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste over the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot saying it must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air and that he should make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to view at the rate of a hundred shillings a sight he made himself so killingly funny that he was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy rabble tears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarchs eyes and the thought in his heart was had i offered them a deep wrong they could not be more cruel yet have i proffered nought but to do them a kindness and it is thus they use me for it chapter xviii the prince with the tramps the troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn and set forward on their march there was a lowering sky overhead sloppy ground under foot and a winter chill in the air all gaiety was gone from the company some were sullen and silent some were irritable and petulant none were gentle humoured all were thirsty the ruffler put jack in hugos charge with some brief instructions and commanded john canty to keep away from him and let him alone he also warned hugo not to be too rough with the lad after a while the weather grew milder and the clouds lifted somewhat the troop ceased to shiver and their spirits began to improve they grew more and more cheerful and finally began to chaff each other and insult passengers along the highway this showed that they were awaking to an appreciation of life and its joys once more the dread in which their sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them the road and took their ribald insolences meekly without venturing to talk back they snatched linen from the hedges occasionally in full view of the owners who made no protest but only seemed grateful that they did not take the hedges too by and by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home while the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to furnish a breakfast for them they chucked the housewife and her daughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands and made coarse jests about them accompanied with insulting epithets and bursts of horse laughter they threw bones and vegetables at the farmer and his sons kept them dodging all the time and applauded uproariously when a good hit was made they ended by buttering the head of one of the daughters who resented some of their familiarities when they took their leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the heads of the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the authorities about noon after a long and weary tramp the gang came to a halt behind a hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village an hour was allowed for rest then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village at different points to ply their various trades jack was sent with hugo they wandered hither and thither for some time hugo watching for opportunities to do a stroke of business but finding none so he finally said i see nought to steal it is a paltry place wherefore we will beg we forsooth follow thy trade it befits thee but i will not beg thou lt not beg exclaimed hugo eyeing the king with surprise prithee since when hast thou reformed what dost thou mean mean hast thou not begged the streets of london all thy life i thou idiot spare thy compliments thy stock will last the longer thy father says thou hast begged all thy days mayhap he lied peradventure you will even make so bold as to say he lied scoffed hugo him you call my father yes he lied come play not thy merry game of madman so far mate use it for thy amusement not thy hurt an i tell him this he will scorch thee finely for it save thyself the trouble i will tell him i like thy spirit i do in truth but i do not admire thy judgment bone rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life without going out of ones way to invite them but a truce to these matters i believe your father i doubt not he can lie i doubt not he doth lie upon occasion for the best of us do that but there is no occasion here a wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for nought but come sith it is thy humour to give over begging wherewithal shall we busy ourselves with robbing kitchens the king said impatiently have done with this folly you weary me hugo replied with temper now harkee mate you will not beg you will not rob so be it but i will tell you what you will do you will play decoy whilst i beg refuse an you think you may venture the king was about to reply contemptuously when hugo said interrupting peace here comes one with a kindly face now will i fall down in a fit when the stranger runs to me set you up a wail and fall upon your knees seeming to weep then cry out as all the devils of misery were in your belly and say oh sir it is my poor afflicted brother and we be friendlesso gods name cast through your merciful eyes one pitiful look upon a sick forsaken and most miserable wretch bestow one little penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of god and ready to perish and mind you keep you on wailing and abate not till we bilk him of his penny else shall you rue it then immediately hugo began to moan and groan and roll his eyes and reel and totter about and when the stranger was close at hand down he sprawled before him with a shriek and began to writhe and wallow in the dirt in seeming agony o dearo dear cried the benevolent strangero poor soul poor soul how he doth suffer there let me help thee up o noble sir forbear and god love you for a princely gentleman but it giveth me cruel pain to touch me when i am taken so my brother there will tell your worship how i am racked with anguish when these fits be upon me a penny dear sir a penny to buy a little food then leave me to my sorrows a penny thou shalt have three thou hapless creature and he fumbled in his pocket with nervous haste and got them out there poor lad take them and most welcome now come hither my boy and help me carry thy stricken brother to yon house where i am not his brother said the king interrupting what not his brother oh hear him groaned hugo then privately ground his teeth he denies his own brother and he with one foot in the grave boy thou art indeed hard of heart if this is thy brother for shame and he scarce able to move hand or foot if he is not thy brother who is he then a beggar and a thief he has got your money and has picked your pocket likewise an thou would st do a healing miracle lay thy staff over his shoulders and trust providence for the rest but hugo did not tarry for the miracle in a moment he was up and off like the wind the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry lustily as he went the king breathing deep gratitude to heaven for his own release fled in the opposite direction and did not slacken his pace until he was out of harms reach he took the first road that offered and soon put the village behind him he hurried along as briskly as he could during several hours keeping a nervous watch over his shoulder for pursuit but his fears left him at last and a grateful sense of security took their place he recognised now that he was hungry and also very tired so he halted at a farmhouse but when he was about to speak he was cut short and driven rudely away his clothes were against him he wandered on wounded and indignant and was resolved to put himself in the way of like treatment no more but hunger is prides master so as the evening drew near he made an attempt at another farmhouse but here he fared worse than before for he was called hard names and was promised arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly the night came on chilly and overcast and still the footsore monarch laboured slowly on he was obliged to keep moving for every time he sat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold all his sensations and experiences as he moved through the solemn gloom and the empty vastness of the night were new and strange to him at intervals he heard voices approach pass by and fade into silence and as he saw nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of formless drifting blur there was something spectral and uncanny about it all that made him shudder occasionally he caught the twinkle of a light always far away apparently almost in another world if he heard the tinkle of a sheeps bell it was vague distant indistinct the muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in vanishing cadences a mournful sound now and then came the complaining howl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest all sounds were remote they made the little king feel that all life and activity were far removed from him and that he stood solitary companionless in the centre of a measureless solitude he stumbled along through the gruesome fascinations of this new experience startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves overhead so like human whispers they seemed to sound and by and by he came suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand he stepped back into the shadows and waited the lantern stood by the open door of a barn the king waited some time there was no sound and nobody stirring he got so cold standing still and the hospitable barn looked so enticing that at last he resolved to risk everything and enter he started swiftly and stealthily and just as he was crossing the threshold he heard voices behind him he darted behind a cask within the barn and stooped down two farm labourers came in bringing the lantern with them and fell to work talking meanwhile whilst they moved about with the light the king made good use of his eyes and took the bearings of what seemed to be a good sized stall at the further end of the place purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to himself he also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets midway of the route with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the crown of england for one night by and by the men finished and went away fastening the door behind them and taking the lantern with them the shivering king made for the blankets with as good speed as the darkness would allow gathered them up and then groped his way safely to the stall of two of the blankets he made a bed then covered himself with the remaining two he was a glad monarch now though the blankets were old and thin and not quite warm enough and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost suffocatingly powerful although the king was hungry and chilly he was also so tired and so drowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage of the former and he presently dozed off into a state of semi consciousness then just as he was on the point of losing himself wholly he distinctly felt something touch him he was broad awake in a moment and gasping for breath the cold horror of that mysterious touch in the dark almost made his heart stand still he lay motionless and listened scarcely breathing but nothing stirred and there was no sound he continued to listen and wait during what seemed a long time but still nothing stirred and there was no sound so he began to drop into a drowse once more at last and all at once he felt that mysterious touch again it was a grisly thing this light touch from this noiseless and invisible presence it made the boy sick with ghostly fears what should he do that was the question but he did not know how to answer it should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters and fly from this inscrutable horror but fly whither he could not get out of the barn and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and thither in the dark within the captivity of the four walls with this phantom gliding after him and visiting him with that soft hideous touch upon cheek or shoulder at every turn was intolerable but to stay where he was and endure this living death all night was that better no what then was there left to do ah there was but one course he knew it well he must put out his hand and find that thing it was easy to think this but it was hard to brace himself up to try it three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark gingerly and snatched it suddenly back with a gasp not because it had encountered anything but because he had felt so sure it was just going to but the fourth time he groped a little further and his hand lightly swept against something soft and warm this petrified him nearly with fright his mind was in such a state that he could imagine the thing to be nothing else than a corpse newly dead and still warm he thought he would rather die than touch it again but he thought this false thought because he did not know the immortal strength of human curiosity in no long time his hand was tremblingly groping again against his judgment and without his consent but groping persistently on just the same it encountered a bunch of long hair he shuddered but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm rope followed up the rope and found an innocent calf for the rope was not a rope at all but the calfs tail the king was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that fright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf but he need not have felt so about it for it was not the calf that frightened him but a dreadful non existent something which the calf stood for and any other boy in those old superstitious times would have acted and suffered just as he had done the king was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a calf but delighted to have the calfs company for he had been feeling so lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even this humble animal were welcome and he had been so buffeted so rudely entreated by his own kind that it was a real comfort to him to feel that he was at last in the society of a fellow creature that had at least a soft heart and a gentle spirit whatever loftier attributes might be lacking so he resolved to waive rank and make friends with the calf while stroking its sleek warm back for it lay near him and within easy reach it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways than one whereupon he re arranged his bed spreading it down close to the calf then he cuddled himself up to the calfs back drew the covers up over himself and his friend and in a minute or two was as warm and comfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace of westminster pleasant thoughts came at once life took on a cheerfuller seeming he was free of the bonds of servitude and crime free of the companionship of base and brutal outlaws he was warm he was sheltered in a word he was happy the night wind was rising it swept by in fitful gusts that made the old barn quake and rattle then its forces died down at intervals and went moaning and wailing around corners and projections but it was all music to the king now that he was snug and comfortable let it blow and rage let it batter and bang let it moan and wail he minded it not he only enjoyed it he merely snuggled the closer to his friend in a luxury of warm contentment and drifted blissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that was full of serenity and peace the distant dogs howled the melancholy kine complained and the winds went on raging whilst furious sheets of rain drove along the roof but the majesty of england slept on undisturbed and the calf did the same it being a simple creature and not easily troubled by storms or embarrassed by sleeping with a king chapter xix the prince with the peasants when the king awoke in the early morning he found that a wet but thoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy bed for itself in his bosom being disturbed now it scampered away the boy smiled and said poor fool why so fearful i am as forlorn as thou twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless who am myself so helpless moreover i owe you thanks for a good omen for when a king has fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him it surely meaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn since it is plain he can no lower go he got up and stepped out of the stall and just then he heard the sound of childrens voices the barn door opened and a couple of little girls came in as soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased and they stopped and stood still gazing at him with strong curiosity they presently began to whisper together then they approached nearer and stopped again to gaze and whisper by and by they gathered courage and began to discuss him aloud one said he hath a comely face the other added and pretty hair but is ill clothed enow and how starved he looketh they came still nearer sidling shyly around and about him examining him minutely from all points as if he were some strange new kind of animal but warily and watchfully the while as if they half feared he might be a sort of animal that would bite upon occasion finally they halted before him holding each others hands for protection and took a good satisfying stare with their innocent eyes then one of them plucked up all her courage and inquired with honest directness who art thou boy i am the king was the grave answer the children gave a little start and their eyes spread themselves wide open and remained so during a speechless half minute then curiosity broke the silence the king what king the king of england the children looked at each other then at him then at each other again wonderingly perplexedly then one said didst hear him margery he said he is the king can that be true how can it be else but true prissy would he say a lie for look you prissy an it were not true it would be a lie it surely would be now think ont for all things that be not true be lies thou canst make nought else out of it it was a good tight argument without a leak in it anywhere and it left prissys half doubts not a leg to stand on she considered a moment then put the king upon his honour with the simple remark if thou art truly the king then i believe thee i am truly the king this settled the matter his majestys royalty was accepted without further question or discussion and the two little girls began at once to inquire into how he came to be where he was and how he came to be so unroyally clad and whither he was bound and all about his affairs it was a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not be scoffed at or doubted so he told his tale with feeling forgetting even his hunger for the time and it was received with the deepest and tenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids but when he got down to his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without food they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a breakfast for him the king was cheerful and happy now and said to himself when i am come to mine own again i will always honour little children remembering how that these trusted me and believed in me in my time of trouble whilst they that were older and thought themselves wiser mocked at me and held me for a liar the childrens mother received the king kindly and was full of pity for his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her womanly heart she was a widow and rather poor consequently she had seen trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate she imagined that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or keepers so she tried to find out whence he had come in order that she might take measures to return him but all her references to neighbouring towns and villages and all her inquiries in the same line went for nothing the boys face and his answers too showed that the things she was talking of were not familiar to him he spoke earnestly and simply about court matters and broke down more than once when speaking of the late king his father but whenever the conversation changed to baser topics he lost interest and became silent the woman was mightily puzzled but she did not give up as she proceeded with her cooking she set herself to contriving devices to surprise the boy into betraying his real secret she talked about cattle he showed no concern then about sheep the same result so her guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error she talked about mills and about weavers tinkers smiths trades and tradesmen of all sorts and about bedlam and jails and charitable retreats but no matter she was baffled at all points not altogether either for she argued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service yes she was sure she was on the right track now he must have been a house servant so she led up to that but the result was discouraging the subject of sweeping appeared to weary him fire building failed to stir him scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm the goodwife touched with a perishing hope and rather as a matter of form upon the subject of cooking to her surprise and her vast delight the kings face lighted at once ah she had hunted him down at last she thought and she was right proud too of the devious shrewdness and tact which had accomplished it her tired tongue got a chance to rest now for the kings inspired by gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering pots and pans turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an eloquent dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes that within three minutes the woman said to herself of a truth i was right he hath holpen in a kitchen then he broadened his bill of fare and discussed it with such appreciation and animation that the goodwife said to herself good lack how can he know so many dishes and so fine ones withal for these belong only upon the tables of the rich and great ah now i see ragged outcast as he is he must have served in the palace before his reason went astray yes he must have helped in the very kitchen of the king himself i will test him full of eagerness to prove her sagacity she told the king to mind the cooking a moment hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or two if he chose then she went out of the room and gave her children a sign to follow after the king muttered another english king had a commission like to this in a bygone time it is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the great alfred stooped to assume but i will try to better serve my trust than he for he let the cakes burn the intent was good but the performance was not answerable to it for this king like the other one soon fell into deep thinkings concerning his vast affairs and the same calamity resulted the cookery got burned the woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire destruction and she promptly brought the king out of his dreams with a brisk and cordial tongue lashing then seeing how troubled he was over his violated trust she softened at once and was all goodness and gentleness toward him the boy made a hearty and satisfying meal and was greatly refreshed and gladdened by it it was a meal which was distinguished by this curious feature that rank was waived on both sides yet neither recipient of the favour was aware that it had been extended the goodwife had intended to feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner like any other tramp or like a dog but she was so remorseful for the scolding she had given him that she did what she could to atone for it by allowing him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters on ostensible terms of equality with them and the king on his side was so remorseful for having broken his trust after the family had been so kind to him that he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself to the family level instead of requiring the woman and her children to stand and wait upon him while he occupied their table in the solitary state due to his birth and dignity it does us all good to unbend sometimes this good woman was made happy all the day long by the applauses which she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension to a tramp and the king was just as self complacent over his gracious humility toward a humble peasant woman when breakfast was over the housewife told the king to wash up the dishes this command was a staggerer for a moment and the king came near rebelling but then he said to himself alfred the great watched the cakes doubtless he would have washed the dishes too therefore will i essay it he made a sufficiently poor job of it and to his surprise too for the cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do it was a tedious and troublesome piece of work but he finished it at last he was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now however he was not to lose this thrifty dames society so easily she furnished him some little odds and ends of employment which he got through with after a fair fashion and with some credit then she set him and the little girls to paring some winter apples but he was so awkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a butcher knife to grind afterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he had laid the good king alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in story books and histories and so he was half minded to resign and when just after the noonday dinner the goodwife gave him a basket of kittens to drown he did resign at least he was just going to resign for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere and it seemed to him that to draw it at kitten drowning was about the right thing when there was an interruption the interruption was john canty with a peddlers pack on his back and hugo the king discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they had had a chance to see him so he said nothing about drawing the line but took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way without a word he left the creatures in an out house and hurried on into a narrow lane at the rear chapter xx the prince and the hermit the high hedge hid him from the house now and so under the impulse of a deadly fright he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the distance he never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter of the forest then he turned and descried two figures in the distance that was sufficient he did not wait to scan them critically but hurried on and never abated his pace till he was far within the twilight depths of the wood then he stopped being persuaded that he was now tolerably safe he listened intently but the stillness was profound and solemn awful even and depressing to the spirits at wide intervals his straining ear did detect sounds but they were so remote and hollow and mysterious that they seemed not to be real sounds but only the moaning and complaining ghosts of departed ones so the sounds were yet more dreary than the silence which they interrupted it was his purpose in the beginning to stay where he was the rest of the day but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body and he was at last obliged to resume movement in order to get warm he struck straight through the forest hoping to pierce to a road presently but he was disappointed in this he travelled on and on but the farther he went the denser the wood became apparently the gloom began to thicken by and by and the king realised that the night was coming on it made him shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place so he tried to hurry faster but he only made the less speed for he could not now see well enough to choose his steps judiciously consequently he kept tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers and how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light he approached it warily stopping often to look about him and listen it came from an unglazed window opening in a shabby little hut he heard a voice now and felt a disposition to run and hide but he changed his mind at once for this voice was praying evidently he glided to the one window of the hut raised himself on tiptoe and stole a glance within the room was small its floor was the natural earth beaten hard by use in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or two near it was a pail a cup a basin and two or three pots and pans there was a short bench and a three legged stool on the hearth the remains of a faggot fire were smouldering before a shrine which was lighted by a single candle knelt an aged man and on an old wooden box at his side lay an open book and a human skull the man was of large bony frame his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white he was clothed in a robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his heels a holy hermit said the king to himself now am i indeed fortunate the hermit rose from his knees the king knocked a deep voice responded enter but leave sin behind for the ground whereon thou shalt stand is holy the king entered and paused the hermit turned a pair of gleaming unrestful eyes upon him and said who art thou i am the king came the answer with placid simplicity welcome king cried the hermit with enthusiasm then bustling about with feverish activity and constantly saying welcome welcome he arranged his bench seated the king on it by the hearth threw some faggots on the fire and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous stride welcome many have sought sanctuary here but they were not worthy and were turned away but a king who casts his crown away and despises the vain splendours of his office and clothes his body in rags to devote his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh he is worthy he is welcome here shall he abide all his days till death come the king hastened to interrupt and explain but the hermit paid no attention to him did not even hear him apparently but went right on with his talk with a raised voice and a growing energy and thou shalt be at peace here none shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee with supplications to return to that empty and foolish life which god hath moved thee to abandon thou shalt pray here thou shalt study the book thou shalt meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world and upon the sublimities of the world to come thou shalt feed upon crusts and herbs and scourge thy body with whips daily to the purifying of thy soul thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin thou shalt drink water only and thou shalt be at peace yes wholly at peace for whoso comes to seek thee shall go his way again baffled he shall not find thee he shall not molest thee the old man still pacing back and forth ceased to speak aloud and began to mutter the king seized this opportunity to state his case and he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension but the hermit went on muttering and gave no heed and still muttering he approached the king and said impressively sh i will tell you a secret he bent down to impart it but checked himself and assumed a listening attitude after a moment or two he went on tiptoe to the window opening put his head out and peered around in the gloaming then came tiptoeing back again put his face close down to the kings and whispered i am an archangel the king started violently and said to himself would god i were with the outlaws again for lo now am i the prisoner of a madman his apprehensions were heightened and they showed plainly in his face in a low excited voice the hermit continued i see you feel my atmosphere theres awe in your face none may be in this atmosphere and not be thus affected for it is the very atmosphere of heaven i go thither and return in the twinkling of an eye i was made an archangel on this very spot it is five years ago by angels sent from heaven to confer that awful dignity their presence filled this place with an intolerable brightness and they knelt to me king yes they knelt to me for i was greater than they i have walked in the courts of heaven and held speech with the patriarchs touch my hand be not afraid touch it there now thou hast touched a hand which has been clasped by abraham and isaac and jacob for i have walked in the golden courts i have seen the deity face to face he paused to give this speech effect then his face suddenly changed and he started to his feet again saying with angry energy yes i am an archangel a mere archangel i that might have been pope it is verily true i was told it from heaven in a dream twenty years ago ah yes i was to be pope and i should have been pope for heaven had said it but the king dissolved my religious house and i poor obscure unfriended monk was cast homeless upon the world robbed of my mighty destiny here he began to mumble again and beat his forehead in futile rage with his fist now and then articulating a venomous curse and now and then a pathetic wherefore i am nought but an archangel i that should have been pope so he went on for an hour whilst the poor little king sat and suffered then all at once the old mans frenzy departed and he became all gentleness his voice softened he came down out of his clouds and fell to prattling along so simply and so humanly that he soon won the kings heart completely the old devotee moved the boy nearer to the fire and made him comfortable doctored his small bruises and abrasions with a deft and tender hand and then set about preparing and cooking a supper chatting pleasantly all the time and occasionally stroking the lads cheek or patting his head in such a gently caressing way that in a little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were changed to reverence and affection for the man this happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper then after a prayer before the shrine the hermit put the boy to bed in a small adjoining room tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother might and so with a parting caress left him and sat down by the fire and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way presently he paused then tapped his forehead several times with his fingers as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his mind apparently he was unsuccessful now he started quickly up and entered his guests room and said thou art king yes was the response drowsily uttered what king of england of england then henry is gone alack it is so i am his son a black frown settled down upon the hermits face and he clenched his bony hands with a vindictive energy he stood a few moments breathing fast and swallowing repeatedly then said in a husky voice dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and homeless there was no response the old man bent down and scanned the boys reposeful face and listened to his placid breathing he sleeps sleeps soundly and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of evil satisfaction a smile flitted across the dreaming boys features the hermit muttered so his heart is happy and he turned away he went stealthily about the place seeking here and there for something now and then halting to listen now and then jerking his head around and casting a quick glance toward the bed and always muttering always mumbling to himself at last he found what he seemed to want a rusty old butcher knife and a whetstone then he crept to his place by the fire sat himself down and began to whet the knife softly on the stone still muttering mumbling ejaculating the winds sighed around the lonely place the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the distances the shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at the old man from cracks and coverts but he went on with his work rapt absorbed and noted none of these things at long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife and nodded his head with satisfaction it grows sharper he said yes it grows sharper he took no note of the flight of time but worked tranquilly on entertaining himself with his thoughts which broke out occasionally in articulate speech his father wrought us evil he destroyed us and is gone down into the eternal fires yes down into the eternal fires he escaped us but it was gods will yes it was gods will we must not repine but he hath not escaped the fires no he hath not escaped the fires the consuming unpitying remorseless fires and they are everlasting and so he wrought and still wrought mumbling chuckling a low rasping chuckle at times and at times breaking again into words it was his father that did it all i am but an archangel but for him i should be pope the king stirred the hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside and went down upon his knees bending over the prostrate form with his knife uplifted the boy stirred again his eyes came open for an instant but there was no speculation in them they saw nothing the next moment his tranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more the hermit watched and listened for a time keeping his position and scarcely breathing then he slowly lowered his arms and presently crept away saying it is long past midnight it is not best that he should cry out lest by accident someone be passing he glided about his hovel gathering a rag here a thong there and another one yonder then he returned and by careful and gentle handling he managed to tie the kings ankles together without waking him next he essayed to tie the wrists he made several attempts to cross them but the boy always drew one hand or the other away just as the cord was ready to be applied but at last when the archangel was almost ready to despair the boy crossed his hands himself and the next moment they were bound now a bandage was passed under the sleepers chin and brought up over his head and tied fast and so softly so gradually and so deftly were the knots drawn together and compacted that the boy slept peacefully through it all without stirring chapter xxi hendon to the rescue the old man glided away stooping stealthy cat like and brought the low bench he seated himself upon it half his body in the dim and flickering light and the other half in shadow and so with his craving eyes bent upon the slumbering boy he kept his patient vigil there heedless of the drift of time and softly whetted his knife and mumbled and chuckled and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as a grizzly monstrous spider gloating over some hapless insect that lay bound and helpless in his web after a long while the old man who was still gazing yet not seeing his mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction observed on a sudden that the boys eyes were open wide open and staring staring up in frozen horror at the knife the smile of a gratified devil crept over the old mans face and he said without changing his attitude or his occupation son of henry the eighth hast thou prayed the boy struggled helplessly in his bonds and at the same time forced a smothered sound through his closed jaws which the hermit chose to interpret as an affirmative answer to his question then pray again pray the prayer for the dying a shudder shook the boys frame and his face blenched then he struggled again to free himself turning and twisting himself this way and that tugging frantically fiercely desperately but uselessly to burst his fetters and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him and nodded his head and placidly whetted his knife mumbling from time to time the moments are precious they are few and precious pray the prayer for the dying the boy uttered a despairing groan and ceased from his struggles panting the tears came then and trickled one after the other down his face but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the savage old man the dawn was coming now the hermit observed it and spoke up sharply with a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice i may not indulge this ecstasy longer the night is already gone it seems but a moment only a moment would it had endured a year seed of the churchs spoiler close thy perishing eyes an thou fearest to look upon the rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings the old man sank upon his knees his knife in his hand and bent himself over the moaning boy hark there was a sound of voices near the cabin the knife dropped from the hermits hand he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up trembling the sounds increased and presently the voices became rough and angry then came blows and cries for help then a clatter of swift footsteps retreating immediately came a succession of thundering knocks upon the cabin door followed by hullo o o open and despatch in the name of all the devils oh this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the kings ears for it was miles hendons voice the hermit grinding his teeth in impotent rage moved swiftly out of the bedchamber closing the door behind him and straightway the king heard a talk to this effect proceeding from the chapel homage and greeting reverend sir where is the boy my boy what boy friend what boy lie me no lies sir priest play me no deceptions i am not in the humour for it near to this place i caught the scoundrels who i judged did steal him from me and i made them confess they said he was at large again and they had tracked him to your door they showed me his very footprints now palter no more for look you holy sir an thou produce him not where is the boy o good sir peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried here the night if such as you take an interest in such as he know then that i have sent him of an errand he will be back anon how soon how soon come waste not the time cannot i overtake him how soon will he be back thou need st not stir he will return quickly so be it then i will try to wait but stop you sent him of an errand you verily this is a lie he would not go he would pull thy old beard an thou didst offer him such an insolence thou hast lied friend thou hast surely lied he would not go for thee nor for any man for any man no haply not but i am not a man what now o gods name what art thou then it is a secret mark thou reveal it not i am an archangel there was a tremendous ejaculation from miles hendon not altogether unprofane followed by this doth well and truly account for his complaisance right well i knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any mortal but lord even a king must obey when an archangel gives the word o command let me sh what noise was that all this while the little king had been yonder alternately quaking with terror and trembling with hope and all the while too he had thrown all the strength he could into his anguished moanings constantly expecting them to reach hendons ear but always realising with bitterness that they failed or at least made no impression so this last remark of his servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh fields to the dying and he exerted himself once more and with all his energy just as the hermit was saying noise i heard only the wind mayhap it was yes doubtless that was it i have been hearing it faintly all the there it is again it is not the wind what an odd sound come we will hunt it out now the kings joy was nearly insupportable his tired lungs did their utmost and hopefully too but the sealed jaws and the muffling sheepskin sadly crippled the effort then the poor fellows heart sank to hear the hermit say ah it came from without i think from the copse yonder come i will lead the way the king heard the two pass out talking heard their footsteps die quickly away then he was alone with a boding brooding awful silence it seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching again and this time he heard an added sound the trampling of hoofs apparently then he heard hendon say i will not wait longer i cannot wait longer he has lost his way in this thick wood which direction took he quick point it out to me he but wait i will go with thee good good why truly thou art better than thy looks marry i do not think theres not another archangel with so right a heart as thine wilt ride wilt take the wee donkey thats for my boy or wilt thou fork thy holy legs over this ill conditioned slave of a mule that i have provided for myself and had been cheated in too had he cost but the indifferent sum of a months usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker out of work no ride thy mule and lead thine ass i am surer on mine own feet and will walk then prithee mind the little beast for me while i take my life in my hands and make what success i may toward mounting the big one then followed a confusion of kicks cuffs tramplings and plungings accompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed curses and finally a bitter apostrophe to the mule which must have broken its spirit for hostilities seemed to cease from that moment with unutterable misery the fettered little king heard the voices and footsteps fade away and die out all hope forsook him now for the moment and a dull despair settled down upon his heart my only friend is deceived and got rid of he said the hermit will return and he finished with a gasp and at once fell to struggling so frantically with his bonds again that he shook off the smothering sheepskin and now he heard the door open the sound chilled him to the marrow already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat horror made him close his eyes horror made him open them again and before him stood john canty and hugo he would have said thank god if his jaws had been free a moment or two later his limbs were at liberty and his captors each gripping him by an arm were hurrying him with all speed through the forest chapter xxii a victim of treachery once more king foo foo the first was roving with the tramps and outlaws a butt for their coarse jests and dull witted railleries and sometimes the victim of small spitefulness at the hands of canty and hugo when the rufflers back was turned none but canty and hugo really disliked him some of the others liked him and all admired his pluck and spirit during two or three days hugo in whose ward and charge the king was did what he covertly could to make the boy uncomfortable and at night during the customary orgies he amused the company by putting small indignities upon him always as if by accident twice he stepped upon the kings toes accidentally and the king as became his royalty was contemptuously unconscious of it and indifferent to it but the third time hugo entertained himself in that way the king felled him to the ground with a cudgel to the prodigious delight of the tribe hugo consumed with anger and shame sprang up seized a cudgel and came at his small adversary in a fury instantly a ring was formed around the gladiators and the betting and cheering began but poor hugo stood no chance whatever his frantic and lubberly prentice work found but a poor market for itself when pitted against an arm which had been trained by the first masters of europe in single stick quarter staff and every art and trick of swordsmanship the little king stood alert but at graceful ease and caught and turned aside the thick rain of blows with a facility and precision which set the motley on lookers wild with admiration and every now and then when his practised eye detected an opening and a lightning swift rap upon hugos head followed as a result the storm of cheers and laughter that swept the place was something wonderful to hear at the end of fifteen minutes hugo all battered bruised and the target for a pitiless bombardment of ridicule slunk from the field and the unscathed hero of the fight was seized and borne aloft upon the shoulders of the joyous rabble to the place of honour beside the ruffler where with vast ceremony he was crowned king of the game cocks his meaner title being at the same time solemnly cancelled and annulled and a decree of banishment from the gang pronounced against any who should thenceforth utter it all attempts to make the king serviceable to the troop had failed he had stubbornly refused to act moreover he was always trying to escape he had been thrust into an unwatched kitchen the first day of his return he not only came forth empty handed but tried to rouse the housemates he was sent out with a tinker to help him at his work he would not work moreover he threatened the tinker with his own soldering iron and finally both hugo and the tinker found their hands full with the mere matter of keeping his from getting away he delivered the thunders of his royalty upon the heads of all who hampered his liberties or tried to force him to service he was sent out in hugos charge in company with a slatternly woman and a diseased baby to beg but the result was not encouraging he declined to plead for the mendicants or be a party to their cause in any way thus several days went by and the miseries of this tramping life and the weariness and sordidness and meanness and vulgarity of it became gradually and steadily so intolerable to the captive that he began at last to feel that his release from the hermits knife must prove only a temporary respite from death at best but at night in his dreams these things were forgotten and he was on his throne and master again this of course intensified the sufferings of the awakening so the mortifications of each succeeding morning of the few that passed between his return to bondage and the combat with hugo grew bitterer and bitterer and harder and harder to bear the morning after that combat hugo got up with a heart filled with vengeful purposes against the king he had two plans in particular one was to inflict upon the lad what would be to his proud spirit and imagined royalty a peculiar humiliation and if he failed to accomplish this his other plan was to put a crime of some kind upon the king and then betray him into the implacable clutches of the law in pursuance of the first plan he purposed to put a clime upon the kings leg rightly judging that that would mortify him to the last and perfect degree and as soon as the clime should operate he meant to get cantys help and force the king to expose his leg in the highway and beg for alms clime was the cant term for a sore artificially created to make a clime the operator made a paste or poultice of unslaked lime soap and the rust of old iron and spread it upon a piece of leather which was then bound tightly upon the leg this would presently fret off the skin and make the flesh raw and angry looking blood was then rubbed upon the limb which being fully dried took on a dark and repulsive colour then a bandage of soiled rags was put on in a cleverly careless way which would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen and move the compassion of the passer by hugo got the help of the tinker whom the king had cowed with the soldering iron they took the boy out on a tinkering tramp and as soon as they were out of sight of the camp they threw him down and the tinker held him while hugo bound the poultice tight and fast upon his leg the king raged and stormed and promised to hang the two the moment the sceptre was in his hand again but they kept a firm grip upon him and enjoyed his impotent struggling and jeered at his threats this continued until the poultice began to bite and in no long time its work would have been perfected if there had been no interruption but there was for about this time the slave who had made the speech denouncing englands laws appeared on the scene and put an end to the enterprise and stripped off the poultice and bandage the king wanted to borrow his deliverers cudgel and warm the jackets of the two rascals on the spot but the man said no it would bring trouble leave the matter till night the whole tribe being together then the outside world would not venture to interfere or interrupt he marched the party back to camp and reported the affair to the ruffler who listened pondered and then decided that the king should not be again detailed to beg since it was plain he was worthy of something higher and better wherefore on the spot he promoted him from the mendicant rank and appointed him to steal hugo was overjoyed he had already tried to make the king steal and failed but there would be no more trouble of that sort now for of course the king would not dream of defying a distinct command delivered directly from head quarters so he planned a raid for that very afternoon purposing to get the king in the laws grip in the course of it and to do it too with such ingenious strategy that it should seem to be accidental and unintentional for the king of the game cocks was popular now and the gang might not deal over gently with an unpopular member who played so serious a treachery upon him as the delivering him over to the common enemy the law very well all in good time hugo strolled off to a neighbouring village with his prey and the two drifted slowly up and down one street after another the one watching sharply for a sure chance to achieve his evil purpose and the other watching as sharply for a chance to dart away and get free of his infamous captivity for ever both threw away some tolerably fair looking opportunities for both in their secret hearts were resolved to make absolutely sure work this time and neither meant to allow his fevered desires to seduce him into any venture that had much uncertainty about it hugos chance came first for at last a woman approached who carried a fat package of some sort in a basket hugos eyes sparkled with sinful pleasure as he said to himself breath o my life an i can but put that upon him tis good den and god keep thee king of the game cocks he waited and watched outwardly patient but inwardly consuming with excitement till the woman had passed by and the time was ripe then said in a low voice tarry here till i come again and darted stealthily after the prey the kings heart was filled with joy he could make his escape now if hugos quest only carried him far enough away but he was to have no such luck hugo crept behind the woman snatched the package and came running back wrapping it in an old piece of blanket which he carried on his arm the hue and cry was raised in a moment by the woman who knew her loss by the lightening of her burden although she had not seen the pilfering done hugo thrust the bundle into the kings hands without halting saying now speed ye after me with the rest and cry stop thief but mind ye lead them astray the next moment hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked alley and in another moment or two he lounged into view again looking innocent and indifferent and took up a position behind a post to watch results the insulted king threw the bundle on the ground and the blanket fell away from it just as the woman arrived with an augmenting crowd at her heels she seized the kings wrist with one hand snatched up her bundle with the other and began to pour out a tirade of abuse upon the boy while he struggled without success to free himself from her grip hugo had seen enough his enemy was captured and the law would get him now so he slipped away jubilant and chuckling and wended campwards framing a judicious version of the matter to give to the rufflers crew as he strode along the king continued to struggle in the womans strong grasp and now and then cried out in vexation unhand me thou foolish creature it was not i that bereaved thee of thy paltry goods the crowd closed around threatening the king and calling him names a brawny blacksmith in leather apron and sleeves rolled to his elbows made a reach for him saying he would trounce him well for a lesson but just then a long sword flashed in the air and fell with convincing force upon the mans arm flat side down the fantastic owner of it remarking pleasantly at the same time marry good souls let us proceed gently not with ill blood and uncharitable words this is matter for the laws consideration not private and unofficial handling loose thy hold from the boy goodwife the blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance then went muttering away rubbing his arm the woman released the boys wrist reluctantly the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly but prudently closed their mouths the king sprang to his deliverers side with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes exclaiming thou hast lagged sorely but thou comest in good season now sir miles carve me this rabble to rags chapter xxiii the prince a prisoner hendon forced back a smile and bent down and whispered in the kings ear softly softly my prince wag thy tongue warily nay suffer it not to wag at all trust in me all shall go well in the end then he added to himself sir miles bless me i had totally forgot i was a knight lord how marvellous a thing it is the grip his memory doth take upon his quaint and crazy fancies an empty and foolish title is mine and yet it is something to have deserved it for i think it is more honour to be held worthy to be a spectre knight in his kingdom of dreams and shadows than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of the real kingdoms of this world the crowd fell apart to admit a constable who approached and was about to lay his hand upon the kings shoulder when hendon said gently good friend withhold your hand he shall go peaceably i am responsible for that lead on we will follow the officer led with the woman and her bundle miles and the king followed after with the crowd at their heels the king was inclined to rebel but hendon said to him in a low voice reflect sire your laws are the wholesome breath of your own royalty shall their source resist them yet require the branches to respect them apparently one of these laws has been broken when the king is on his throne again can it ever grieve him to remember that when he was seemingly a private person he loyally sank the king in the citizen and submitted to its authority thou art right say no more thou shalt see that whatsoever the king of england requires a subject to suffer under the law he will himself suffer while he holdeth the station of a subject when the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of the peace she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the person who had committed the theft there was none able to show the contrary so the king stood convicted the bundle was now unrolled and when the contents proved to be a plump little dressed pig the judge looked troubled whilst hendon turned pale and his body was thrilled with an electric shiver of dismay but the king remained unmoved protected by his ignorance the judge meditated during an ominous pause then turned to the woman with the question what dost thou hold this property to be worth the woman courtesied and replied three shillings and eightpence your worship i could not abate a penny and set forth the value honestly the justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd then nodded to the constable and said clear the court and close the doors it was done none remained but the two officials the accused the accuser and miles hendon this latter was rigid and colourless and on his forehead big drops of cold sweat gathered broke and blended together and trickled down his face the judge turned to the woman again and said in a compassionate voice tis a poor ignorant lad and mayhap was driven hard by hunger for these be grievous times for the unfortunate mark you he hath not an evil face but when hunger driveth good woman dost know that when one steals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha penny the law saith he shall hang for it the little king started wide eyed with consternation but controlled himself and held his peace but not so the woman she sprang to her feet shaking with fright and cried out oh good lack what have i done god a mercy i would not hang the poor thing for the whole world ah save me from this your worship what shall i do what can i do the justice maintained his judicial composure and simply said doubtless it is allowable to revise the value since it is not yet writ upon the record then in gods name call the pig eightpence and heaven bless the day that freed my conscience of this awesome thing miles hendon forgot all decorum in his delight and surprised the king and wounded his dignity by throwing his arms around him and hugging him the woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig and when the constable opened the door for her he followed her out into the narrow hall the justice proceeded to write in his record book hendon always alert thought he would like to know why the officer followed the woman out so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and listened he heard a conversation to this effect it is a fat pig and promises good eating i will buy it of thee here is the eightpence eightpence indeed thou lt do no such thing it cost me three shillings and eightpence good honest coin of the last reign that old harry thats just dead ne er touched or tampered with a fig for thy eightpence stands the wind in that quarter thou wast under oath and so swore falsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence come straightway back with me before his worship and answer for the crime and then the lad will hang there there dear heart say no more i am content give me the eightpence and hold thy peace about the matter the woman went off crying hendon slipped back into the court room and the constable presently followed after hiding his prize in some convenient place the justice wrote a while longer then read the king a wise and kindly lecture and sentenced him to a short imprisonment in the common jail to be followed by a public flogging the astounded king opened his mouth and was probably going to order the good judge to be beheaded on the spot but he caught a warning sign from hendon and succeeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything out of it hendon took him by the hand now made reverence to the justice and the two departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail the moment the street was reached the inflamed monarch halted snatched away his hand and exclaimed idiot dost imagine i will enter a common jail alive hendon bent down and said somewhat sharply will you trust in me peace and forbear to worsen our chances with dangerous speech what god wills will happen thou canst not hurry it thou canst not alter it therefore wait and be patient twill be time enow to rail or rejoice when what is to happen has happened chapter xxiv the escape the short winter day was nearly ended the streets were deserted save for a few random stragglers and these hurried straight along with the intent look of people who were only anxious to accomplish their errands as quickly as possible and then snugly house themselves from the rising wind and the gathering twilight they looked neither to the right nor to the left they paid no attention to our party they did not even seem to see them edward the sixth wondered if the spectacle of a king on his way to jail had ever encountered such marvellous indifference before by and by the constable arrived at a deserted market square and proceeded to cross it when he had reached the middle of it hendon laid his hand upon his arm and said in a low voice bide a moment good sir there is none in hearing and i would say a word to thee my duty forbids it sir prithee hinder me not the night comes on stay nevertheless for the matter concerns thee nearly turn thy back a moment and seem not to see let this poor lad escape this to me sir i arrest thee in nay be not too hasty see thou be careful and commit no foolish error then he shut his voice down to a whisper and said in the mans ear the pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may cost thee thy neck man the poor constable taken by surprise was speechless at first then found his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening but hendon was tranquil and waited with patience till his breath was spent then said i have a liking to thee friend and would not willingly see thee come to harm observe i heard it all every word i will prove it to thee then he repeated the conversation which the officer and the woman had had together in the hall word for word and ended with there have i set it forth correctly should not i be able to set it forth correctly before the judge if occasion required the man was dumb with fear and distress for a moment then he rallied and said with forced lightness tis making a mighty matter indeed out of a jest i but plagued the woman for mine amusement kept you the womans pig for amusement the man answered sharply nought else good sir i tell thee twas but a jest i do begin to believe thee said hendon with a perplexing mixture of mockery and half conviction in his tone but tarry thou here a moment whilst i run and ask his worship for nathless he being a man experienced in law in jests in he was moving away still talking the constable hesitated fidgeted spat out an oath or two then cried out hold hold good sir prithee wait a little the judge why man he hath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a dead corpse come and we will speak further ods body i seem to be in evil case and all for an innocent and thoughtless pleasantry i am a man of family and my wife and little ones list to reason good your worship what wouldst thou of me only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a hundred thousand counting slowly said hendon with the expression of a man who asks but a reasonable favour and that a very little one it is my destruction said the constable despairingly ah be reasonable good sir only look at this matter on all its sides and see how mere a jest it is how manifestly and how plainly it is so and even if one granted it were not a jest it is a fault so small that e en the grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and warning from the judges lips hendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him this jest of thine hath a name in law wot you what it is i knew it not peradventure i have been unwise i never dreamed it had a name ah sweet heaven i thought it was original yes it hath a name in the law this crime is called non compos mentis lex talionis sic transit gloria mundi ah my god and the penalty is death god be merciful to me a sinner by advantage taken of one in fault in dire peril and at thy mercy thou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha penny paying but a trifle for the same and this in the eye of the law is constructive barratry misprision of treason malfeasance in office ad hominem expurgatis in statu quo and the penalty is death by the halter without ransom commutation or benefit of clergy bear me up bear me up sweet sir my legs do fail me be thou merciful spare me this doom and i will turn my back and see nought that shall happen good now thou rt wise and reasonable and thou lt restore the pig i will i will indeed nor ever touch another though heaven send it and an archangel fetch it go i am blind for thy sake i see nothing i will say thou didst break in and wrest the prisoner from my hands by force it is but a crazy ancient door i will batter it down myself betwixt midnight and the morning do it good soul no harm will come of it the judge hath a loving charity for this poor lad and will shed no tears and break no jailers bones for his escape chapter xxv hendon hall as soon as hendon and the king were out of sight of the constable his majesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place outside the town and wait there whilst hendon should go to the inn and settle his account half an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward on hendons sorry steeds the king was warm and comfortable now for he had cast his rags and clothed himself in the second hand suit which hendon had bought on london bridge hendon wished to guard against over fatiguing the boy he judged that hard journeys irregular meals and illiberal measures of sleep would be bad for his crazed mind whilst rest regularity and moderate exercise would be pretty sure to hasten its cure he longed to see the stricken intellect made well again and its diseased visions driven out of the tormented little head therefore he resolved to move by easy stages toward the home whence he had so long been banished instead of obeying the impulse of his impatience and hurrying along night and day when he and the king had journeyed about ten miles they reached a considerable village and halted there for the night at a good inn the former relations were resumed hendon stood behind the kings chair while he dined and waited upon him undressed him when he was ready for bed then took the floor for his own quarters and slept athwart the door rolled up in a blanket the next day and the day after they jogged lazily along talking over the adventures they had met since their separation and mightily enjoying each others narratives hendon detailed all his wide wanderings in search of the king and described how the archangel had led him a fools journey all over the forest and taken him back to the hut finally when he found he could not get rid of him then he said the old man went into the bedchamber and came staggering back looking broken hearted and saying he had expected to find that the boy had returned and laid down in there to rest but it was not so hendon had waited at the hut all day hope of the kings return died out then and he departed upon the quest again and old sanctum sanctorum was truly sorry your highness came not back said hendon i saw it in his face marry i will never doubt that said the king and then told his own story after which hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel during the last day of the trip hendons spirits were soaring his tongue ran constantly he talked about his old father and his brother arthur and told of many things which illustrated their high and generous characters he went into loving frenzies over his edith and was so glad hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and brotherly things about hugh he dwelt a deal on the coming meeting at hendon hall what a surprise it would be to everybody and what an outburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be it was a fair region dotted with cottages and orchards and the road led through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses marked with gentle elevations and depressions suggested the swelling and subsiding undulations of the sea in the afternoon the returning prodigal made constant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock he might not pierce the distance and catch a glimpse of his home at last he was successful and cried out excitedly there is the village my prince and there is the hall close by you may see the towers from here and that wood there that is my fathers park ah now thou lt know what state and grandeur be a house with seventy rooms think of that and seven and twenty servants a brave lodging for such as we is it not so come let us speed my impatience will not brook further delay all possible hurry was made still it was after three o clock before the village was reached the travellers scampered through it hendons tongue going all the time here is the church covered with the same ivy none gone none added yonder is the inn the old red lion and yonder is the market place here is the maypole and here the pump nothing is altered nothing but the people at any rate ten years make a change in people some of these i seem to know but none know me so his chat ran on the end of the village was soon reached then the travellers struck into a crooked narrow road walled in with tall hedges and hurried briskly along it for half a mile then passed into a vast flower garden through an imposing gateway whose huge stone pillars bore sculptured armorial devices a noble mansion was before them welcome to hendon hall my king exclaimed miles ah tis a great day my father and my brother and the lady edith will be so mad with joy that they will have eyes and tongue for none but me in the first transports of the meeting and so thou lt seem but coldly welcomed but mind it not twill soon seem otherwise for when i say thou art my ward and tell them how costly is my love for thee thou lt see them take thee to their breasts for miles hendons sake and make their house and hearts thy home for ever after the next moment hendon sprang to the ground before the great door helped the king down then took him by the hand and rushed within a few steps brought him to a spacious apartment he entered seated the king with more hurry than ceremony then ran toward a young man who sat at a writing table in front of a generous fire of logs embrace me hugh he cried and say thou rt glad i am come again and call our father for home is not home till i shall touch his hand and see his face and hear his voice once more but hugh only drew back after betraying a momentary surprise and bent a grave stare upon the intruder a stare which indicated somewhat of offended dignity at first then changed in response to some inward thought or purpose to an expression of marvelling curiosity mixed with a real or assumed compassion presently he said in a mild voice thy wits seem touched poor stranger doubtless thou hast suffered privations and rude buffetings at the worlds hands thy looks and dress betoken it whom dost thou take me to be take thee prithee for whom else than whom thou art i take thee to be hugh hendon said miles sharply the other continued in the same soft tone and whom dost thou imagine thyself to be imagination hath nought to do with it dost thou pretend thou knowest me not for thy brother miles hendon an expression of pleased surprise flitted across hughs face and he exclaimed what thou art not jesting can the dead come to life god be praised if it be so our poor lost boy restored to our arms after all these cruel years ah it seems too good to be true it is too good to be true i charge thee have pity do not trifle with me quick come to the light let me scan thee well he seized miles by the arm dragged him to the window and began to devour him from head to foot with his eyes turning him this way and that and stepping briskly around him and about him to prove him from all points of view whilst the returned prodigal all aglow with gladness smiled laughed and kept nodding his head and saying go on brother go on and fear not thou lt find nor limb nor feature that cannot bide the test scour and scan me to thy content my good old hugh i am indeed thy old miles thy same old miles thy lost brother ist not so ah tis a great day i said twas a great day give me thy hand give me thy cheek lord i am like to die of very joy he was about to throw himself upon his brother but hugh put up his hand in dissent then dropped his chin mournfully upon his breast saying with emotion ah god of his mercy give me strength to bear this grievous disappointment miles amazed could not speak for a moment then he found his tongue and cried out what disappointment am i not thy brother hugh shook his head sadly and said i pray heaven it may prove so and that other eyes may find the resemblances that are hid from mine alack i fear me the letter spoke but too truly what letter one that came from over sea some six or seven years ago it said my brother died in battle it was a lie call thy father he will know me one may not call the dead dead miless voice was subdued and his lips trembled my father dead oh this is heavy news half my new joy is withered now prithee let me see my brother arthur he will know me he will know me and console me he also is dead god be merciful to me a stricken man gone both gone the worthy taken and the worthless spared in me ah i crave your mercy do not say the lady edith is dead no she lives then god be praised my joy is whole again speed thee brother let her come to me an she say i am not myself but she will not no no she will know me i were a fool to doubt it bring her bring the old servants they too will know me all are gone but five peter halsey david bernard and margaret so saying hugh left the room miles stood musing a while then began to walk the floor muttering the five arch villains have survived the two and twenty leal and honest tis an odd thing he continued walking back and forth muttering to himself he had forgotten the king entirely by and by his majesty said gravely and with a touch of genuine compassion though the words themselves were capable of being interpreted ironically mind not thy mischance good man there be others in the world whose identity is denied and whose claims are derided thou hast company ah my king cried hendon colouring slightly do not thou condemn me wait and thou shalt see i am no impostor she will say it you shall hear it from the sweetest lips in england i an impostor why i know this old hall these pictures of my ancestors and all these things that are about us as a child knoweth its own nursery here was i born and bred my lord i speak the truth i would not deceive thee and should none else believe i pray thee do not thou doubt me i could not bear it i do not doubt thee said the king with a childlike simplicity and faith i thank thee out of my heart exclaimed hendon with a fervency which showed that he was touched the king added with the same gentle simplicity dost thou doubt me a guilty confusion seized upon hendon and he was grateful that the door opened to admit hugh at that moment and saved him the necessity of replying a beautiful lady richly clothed followed hugh and after her came several liveried servants the lady walked slowly with her head bowed and her eyes fixed upon the floor the face was unspeakably sad miles hendon sprang forward crying out oh my edith my darling but hugh waved him back gravely and said to the lady look upon him do you know him at the sound of miless voice the woman had started slightly and her cheeks had flushed she was trembling now she stood still during an impressive pause of several moments then slowly lifted up her head and looked into hendons eyes with a stony and frightened gaze the blood sank out of her face drop by drop till nothing remained but the grey pallor of death then she said in a voice as dead as the face i know him not and turned with a moan and a stifled sob and tottered out of the room miles hendon sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands after a pause his brother said to the servants you have observed him do you know him they shook their heads then the master said the servants know you not sir i fear there is some mistake you have seen that my wife knew you not thy wife in an instant hugh was pinned to the wall with an iron grip about his throat oh thou fox hearted slave i see it all thou st writ the lying letter thyself and my stolen bride and goods are its fruit there now get thee gone lest i shame mine honourable soldiership with the slaying of so pitiful a mannikin hugh red faced and almost suffocated reeled to the nearest chair and commanded the servants to seize and bind the murderous stranger they hesitated and one of them said he is armed sir hugh and we are weaponless armed what of it and ye so many upon him i say but miles warned them to be careful what they did and added ye know me of old i have not changed come on an it like you this reminder did not hearten the servants much they still held back then go ye paltry cowards and arm yourselves and guard the doors whilst i send one to fetch the watch said hugh he turned at the threshold and said to miles you ll find it to your advantage to offend not with useless endeavours at escape escape spare thyself discomfort an that is all that troubles thee for miles hendon is master of hendon hall and all its belongings he will remain doubt it not chapter xxvi disowned the king sat musing a few moments then looked up and said tis strange most strange i cannot account for it no it is not strange my liege i know him and this conduct is but natural he was a rascal from his birth oh i spake not of him sir miles not of him then of what what is it that is strange that the king is not missed how which i doubt i do not understand indeed doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land is not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and making search for me is it no matter for commotion and distress that the head of the state is gone that i am vanished away and lost most true my king i had forgot then hendon sighed and muttered to himself poor ruined mind still busy with its pathetic dream but i have a plan that shall right us both i will write a paper in three tongues latin greek and english and thou shalt haste away with it to london in the morning give it to none but my uncle the lord hertford when he shall see it he will know and say i wrote it then he will send for me might it not be best my prince that we wait here until i prove myself and make my rights secure to my domains i should be so much the better able then to the king interrupted him imperiously peace what are thy paltry domains thy trivial interests contrasted with matters which concern the weal of a nation and the integrity of a throne then he added in a gentle voice as if he were sorry for his severity obey and have no fear i will right thee i will make thee whole yes more than whole i shall remember and requite so saying he took the pen and set himself to work hendon contemplated him lovingly a while then said to himself an it were dark i should think it was a king that spoke theres no denying it when the humours upon on him he doth thunder and lighten like your true king now where got he that trick see him scribble and scratch away contentedly at his meaningless pot hooks fancying them to be latin and greek and except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device for diverting him from his purpose i shall be forced to pretend to post away to morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me the next moment sir miless thoughts had gone back to the recent episode so absorbed was he in his musings that when the king presently handed him the paper which he had been writing he received it and pocketed it without being conscious of the act how marvellous strange she acted he muttered i think she knew me and i think she did not know me these opinions do conflict i perceive it plainly i cannot reconcile them neither can i by argument dismiss either of the two or even persuade one to outweigh the other the matter standeth simply thus she must have known my face my figure my voice for how could it be otherwise yet she said she knew me not and that is proof perfect for she cannot lie but stop i think i begin to see peradventure he hath influenced her commanded her compelled her to lie that is the solution the riddle is unriddled she seemed dead with fear yes she was under his compulsion i will seek her i will find her now that he is away she will speak her true mind she will remember the old times when we were little playfellows together and this will soften her heart and she will no more betray me but will confess me there is no treacherous blood in her no she was always honest and true she has loved me in those old days this is my security for whom one has loved one cannot betray he stepped eagerly toward the door at that moment it opened and the lady edith entered she was very pale but she walked with a firm step and her carriage was full of grace and gentle dignity her face was as sad as before miles sprang forward with a happy confidence to meet her but she checked him with a hardly perceptible gesture and he stopped where he was she seated herself and asked him to do likewise thus simply did she take the sense of old comradeship out of him and transform him into a stranger and a guest the surprise of it the bewildering unexpectedness of it made him begin to question for a moment if he was the person he was pretending to be after all the lady edith said sir i have come to warn you the mad cannot be persuaded out of their delusions perchance but doubtless they may be persuaded to avoid perils i think this dream of yours hath the seeming of honest truth to you and therefore is not criminal but do not tarry here with it for here it is dangerous she looked steadily into miless face a moment then added impressively it is the more dangerous for that you are much like what our lost lad must have grown to be if he had lived heavens madam but i am he i truly think you think it sir i question not your honesty in that i but warn you that is all my husband is master in this region his power hath hardly any limit the people prosper or starve as he wills if you resembled not the man whom you profess to be my husband might bid you pleasure yourself with your dream in peace but trust me i know him well i know what he will do he will say to all that you are but a mad impostor and straightway all will echo him she bent upon miles that same steady look once more and added if you were miles hendon and he knew it and all the region knew it consider what i am saying weigh it well you would stand in the same peril your punishment would be no less sure he would deny you and denounce you and none would be bold enough to give you countenance most truly i believe it said miles bitterly the power that can command one life long friend to betray and disown another and be obeyed may well look to be obeyed in quarters where bread and life are on the stake and no cobweb ties of loyalty and honour are concerned a faint tinge appeared for a moment in the ladys cheek and she dropped her eyes to the floor but her voice betrayed no emotion when she proceeded i have warned you i must still warn you to go hence this man will destroy you else he is a tyrant who knows no pity i who am his fettered slave know this poor miles and arthur and my dear guardian sir richard are free of him and at rest better that you were with them than that you bide here in the clutches of this miscreant your pretensions are a menace to his title and possessions you have assaulted him in his own house you are ruined if you stay go do not hesitate if you lack money take this purse i beg of you and bribe the servants to let you pass oh be warned poor soul and escape while you may miles declined the purse with a gesture and rose up and stood before her grant me one thing he said let your eyes rest upon mine so that i may see if they be steady there now answer me am i miles hendon no i know you not swear it the answer was low but distinct i swear oh this passes belief fly why will you waste the precious time fly and save yourself at that moment the officers burst into the room and a violent struggle began but hendon was soon overpowered and dragged away the king was taken also and both were bound and led to prison chapter xxvii in prison the cells were all crowded so the two friends were chained in a large room where persons charged with trifling offences were commonly kept they had company for there were some twenty manacled and fettered prisoners here of both sexes and of varying ages an obscene and noisy gang the king chafed bitterly over the stupendous indignity thus put upon his royalty but hendon was moody and taciturn he was pretty thoroughly bewildered he had come home a jubilant prodigal expecting to find everybody wild with joy over his return and instead had got the cold shoulder and a jail the promise and the fulfilment differed so widely that the effect was stunning he could not decide whether it was most tragic or most grotesque he felt much as a man might who had danced blithely out to enjoy a rainbow and got struck by lightning but gradually his confused and tormenting thoughts settled down into some sort of order and then his mind centred itself upon edith he turned her conduct over and examined it in all lights but he could not make anything satisfactory out of it did she know him or didnt she know him it was a perplexing puzzle and occupied him a long time but he ended finally with the conviction that she did know him and had repudiated him for interested reasons he wanted to load her name with curses now but this name had so long been sacred to him that he found he could not bring his tongue to profane it wrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition hendon and the king passed a troubled night for a bribe the jailer had furnished liquor to some of the prisoners singing of ribald songs fighting shouting and carousing was the natural consequence at last a while after midnight a man attacked a woman and nearly killed her by beating her over the head with his manacles before the jailer could come to the rescue the jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound clubbing about the head and shoulders then the carousing ceased and after that all had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the annoyance of the moanings and groanings of the two wounded people during the ensuing week the days and nights were of a monotonous sameness as to events men whose faces hendon remembered more or less distinctly came by day to gaze at the impostor and repudiate and insult him and by night the carousing and brawling went on with symmetrical regularity however there was a change of incident at last the jailer brought in an old man and said to him the villain is in this room cast thy old eyes about and see if thou canst say which is he hendon glanced up and experienced a pleasant sensation for the first time since he had been in the jail he said to himself this is blake andrews a servant all his life in my fathers family a good honest soul with a right heart in his breast that is formerly but none are true now all are liars this man will know me and will deny me too like the rest the old man gazed around the room glanced at each face in turn and finally said i see none here but paltry knaves scum o the streets which is he the jailer laughed here he said scan this big animal and grant me an opinion the old man approached and looked hendon over long and earnestly then shook his head and said marry this is no hendon nor ever was right thy old eyes are sound yet an i were sir hugh i would take the shabby carle and the jailer finished by lifting himself a tip toe with an imaginary halter at the same time making a gurgling noise in his throat suggestive of suffocation the old man said vindictively let him bless god an he fare no worse an i had the handling o the villain he should roast or i am no true man the jailer laughed a pleasant hyena laugh and said give him a piece of thy mind old man they all do it thou lt find it good diversion then he sauntered toward his ante room and disappeared the old man dropped upon his knees and whispered god be thanked thou rt come again my master i believed thou wert dead these seven years and lo here thou art alive i knew thee the moment i saw thee and main hard work it was to keep a stony countenance and seem to see none here but tuppenny knaves and rubbish o the streets i am old and poor sir miles but say the word and i will go forth and proclaim the truth though i be strangled for it no said hendon thou shalt not it would ruin thee and yet help but little in my cause but i thank thee for thou hast given me back somewhat of my lost faith in my kind the old servant became very valuable to hendon and the king for he dropped in several times a day to abuse the former and always smuggled in a few delicacies to help out the prison bill of fare he also furnished the current news hendon reserved the dainties for the king without them his majesty might not have survived for he was not able to eat the coarse and wretched food provided by the jailer andrews was obliged to confine himself to brief visits in order to avoid suspicion but he managed to impart a fair degree of information each time information delivered in a low voice for hendons benefit and interlarded with insulting epithets delivered in a louder voice for the benefit of other hearers so little by little the story of the family came out arthur had been dead six years this loss with the absence of news from hendon impaired the fathers health he believed he was going to die and he wished to see hugh and edith settled in life before he passed away but edith begged hard for delay hoping for miless return then the letter came which brought the news of miless death the shock prostrated sir richard he believed his end was very near and he and hugh insisted upon the marriage edith begged for and obtained a months respite then another and finally a third the marriage then took place by the death bed of sir richard it had not proved a happy one it was whispered about the country that shortly after the nuptials the bride found among her husbands papers several rough and incomplete drafts of the fatal letter and had accused him of precipitating the marriage and sir richards death too by a wicked forgery tales of cruelty to the lady edith and the servants were to be heard on all hands and since the fathers death sir hugh had thrown off all soft disguises and become a pitiless master toward all who in any way depended upon him and his domains for bread there was a bit of andrews gossip which the king listened to with a lively interest there is rumour that the king is mad but in charity forbear to say i mentioned it for tis death to speak of it they say his majesty glared at the old man and said the king is not mad good man and thou lt find it to thy advantage to busy thyself with matters that nearer concern thee than this seditious prattle what doth the lad mean said andrews surprised at this brisk assault from such an unexpected quarter hendon gave him a sign and he did not pursue his question but went on with his budget the late king is to be buried at windsor in a day or two the th of the month and the new king will be crowned at westminster the th methinks they must needs find him first muttered his majesty then added confidently but they will look to that and so also shall i in the name of but the old man got no further a warning sign from hendon checked his remark he resumed the thread of his gossip sir hugh goeth to the coronation and with grand hopes he confidently looketh to come back a peer for he is high in favour with the lord protector what lord protector asked his majesty his grace the duke of somerset what duke of somerset marry there is but one seymour earl of hertford the king asked sharply since when is he a duke and lord protector since the last day of january and prithee who made him so himself and the great council with help of the king his majesty started violently the king he cried what king good sir what king indeed god a mercy what aileth the boy sith we have but one tis not difficult to answer his most sacred majesty king edward the sixth whom god preserve yea and a dear and gracious little urchin is he too and whether he be mad or no and they say he mendeth daily his praises are on all mens lips and all bless him likewise and offer prayers that he may be spared to reign long in england for he began humanely with saving the old duke of norfolks life and now is he bent on destroying the cruellest of the laws that harry and oppress the people this news struck his majesty dumb with amazement and plunged him into so deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old mans gossip he wondered if the little urchin was the beggar boy whom he left dressed in his own garments in the palace it did not seem possible that this could be for surely his manners and speech would betray him if he pretended to be the prince of wales then he would be driven out and search made for the true prince could it be that the court had set up some sprig of the nobility in his place no for his uncle would not allow that he was all powerful and could and would crush such a movement of course the boys musings profited him nothing the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he became the more his head ached and the worse he slept his impatience to get to london grew hourly and his captivity became almost unendurable hendons arts all failed with the king he could not be comforted but a couple of women who were chained near him succeeded better under their gentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of patience he was very grateful and came to love them dearly and to delight in the sweet and soothing influence of their presence he asked them why they were in prison and when they said they were baptists he smiled and inquired is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison now i grieve for i shall lose ye they will not keep ye long for such a little thing they did not answer and something in their faces made him uneasy he said eagerly you do not speak be good to me and tell me there will be no other punishment prithee tell me there is no fear of that they tried to change the topic but his fears were aroused and he pursued it will they scourge thee no no they would not be so cruel say they would not come they will not will they the women betrayed confusion and distress but there was no avoiding an answer so one of them said in a voice choked with emotion oh thou lt break our hearts thou gentle spirit god will help us to bear our it is a confession the king broke in then they will scourge thee the stony hearted wretches but oh thou must not weep i cannot bear it keep up thy courage i shall come to my own in time to save thee from this bitter thing and i will do it when the king awoke in the morning the women were gone they are saved he said joyfully then added despondently but woe is me for they were my comforters each of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing in token of remembrance he said he would keep these things always and that soon he would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them under his protection just then the jailer came in with some subordinates and commanded that the prisoners be conducted to the jail yard the king was overjoyed it would be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air once more he fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers but his turn came at last and he was released from his staple and ordered to follow the other prisoners with hendon the court or quadrangle was stone paved and open to the sky the prisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry and were placed in file standing with their backs against the wall a rope was stretched in front of them and they were also guarded by their officers it was a chill and lowering morning and a light snow which had fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added to the general dismalness of its aspect now and then a wintry wind shivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither in the centre of the court stood two women chained to posts a glance showed the king that these were his good friends he shuddered and said to himself alack they are not gone free as i had thought to think that such as these should know the lash in england ay theres the shame of it not in heathennesse christian england they will be scourged and i whom they have comforted and kindly entreated must look on and see the great wrong done it is strange so strange that i the very source of power in this broad realm am helpless to protect them but let these miscreants look well to themselves for there is a day coming when i will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work for every blow they strike now they shall feel a hundred then a great gate swung open and a crowd of citizens poured in they flocked around the two women and hid them from the kings view a clergyman entered and passed through the crowd and he also was hidden the king now heard talking back and forth as if questions were being asked and answered but he could not make out what was said next there was a deal of bustle and preparation and much passing and repassing of officials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of the women and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon the people now by command the masses parted and fell aside and the king saw a spectacle that froze the marrow in his bones faggots had been piled about the two women and a kneeling man was lighting them the women bowed their heads and covered their faces with their hands the yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling faggots and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind the clergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer just then two young girls came flying through the great gate uttering piercing screams and threw themselves upon the women at the stake instantly they were torn away by the officers and one of them was kept in a tight grip but the other broke loose saying she would die with her mother and before she could be stopped she had flung her arms about her mothers neck again she was torn away once more and with her gown on fire two or three men held her and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and thrown flaming aside she struggling all the while to free herself and saying she would be alone in the world now and begging to be allowed to die with her mother both the girls screamed continually and fought for freedom but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of heart piercing shrieks of mortal agony the king glanced from the frantic girls to the stake then turned away and leaned his ashen face against the wall and looked no more he said that which i have seen in that one little moment will never go out from my memory but will abide there and i shall see it all the days and dream of it all the nights till i die would god i had been blind hendon was watching the king he said to himself with satisfaction his disorder mendeth he hath changed and groweth gentler if he had followed his wont he would have stormed at these varlets and said he was king and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed soon his delusion will pass away and be forgotten and his poor mind will be whole again god speed the day that same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night who were being conveyed under guard to various places in the kingdom to undergo punishment for crimes committed the king conversed with these he had made it a point from the beginning to instruct himself for the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity offered and the tale of their woes wrung his heart one of them was a poor half witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a weaver she was to be hanged for it another was a man who had been accused of stealing a horse he said the proof had failed and he had imagined that he was safe from the halter but no he was hardly free before he was arraigned for killing a deer in the kings park this was proved against him and now he was on his way to the gallows there was a tradesmans apprentice whose case particularly distressed the king this youth said he found a hawk one evening that had escaped from its owner and he took it home with him imagining himself entitled to it but the court convicted him of stealing it and sentenced him to death the king was furious over these inhumanities and wanted hendon to break jail and fly with him to westminster so that he could mount his throne and hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and save their lives poor child sighed hendon these woeful tales have brought his malady upon him again alack but for this evil hap he would have been well in a little time among these prisoners was an old lawyer a man with a strong face and a dauntless mien three years past he had written a pamphlet against the lord chancellor accusing him of injustice and had been punished for it by the loss of his ears in the pillory and degradation from the bar and in addition had been fined pounds and sentenced to imprisonment for life lately he had repeated his offence and in consequence was now under sentence to lose what remained of his ears pay a fine of pounds be branded on both cheeks and remain in prison for life these be honourable scars he said and turned back his grey hair and showed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears the kings eye burned with passion he said none believe in me neither wilt thou but no matter within the compass of a month thou shalt be free and more the laws that have dishonoured thee and shamed the english name shall be swept from the statute books the world is made wrong kings should go to school to their own laws at times and so learn mercy chapter xxviii the sacrifice meantime miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and inaction but now his trial came on to his great gratification and he thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment should not be a part of it but he was mistaken about that he was in a fine fury when he found himself described as a sturdy vagabond and sentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character and for assaulting the master of hendon hall his pretensions as to brothership with his prosecutor and rightful heirship to the hendon honours and estates were left contemptuously unnoticed as being not even worth examination he raged and threatened on his way to punishment but it did no good he was snatched roughly along by the officers and got an occasional cuff besides for his irreverent conduct the king could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind so he was obliged to follow in the rear remote from his good friend and servant the king had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for being in such bad company but had been let off with a lecture and a warning in consideration of his youth when the crowd at last halted he flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim hunting a place to get through and at last after a deal of difficulty and delay succeeded there sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks the sport and butt of a dirty mob he the body servant of the king of england edward had heard the sentence pronounced but he had not realised the half that it meant his anger began to rise as the sense of this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home it jumped to summer heat the next moment when he saw an egg sail through the air and crush itself against hendons cheek and heard the crowd roar its enjoyment of the episode he sprang across the open circle and confronted the officer in charge crying for shame this is my servant set him free i am the oh peace exclaimed hendon in a panic thou lt destroy thyself mind him not officer he is mad give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him good man i have small mind to mind him but as to teaching him somewhat to that i am well inclined he turned to a subordinate and said give the little fool a taste or two of the lash to mend his manners half a dozen will better serve his turn suggested sir hugh who had ridden up a moment before to take a passing glance at the proceedings the king was seized he did not even struggle so paralysed was he with the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be inflicted upon his sacred person history was already defiled with the record of the scourging of an english king with whips it was an intolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful page he was in the toils there was no help for him he must either take this punishment or beg for its remission hard conditions he would take the stripes a king might do that but a king could not beg but meantime miles hendon was resolving the difficulty let the child go said he ye heartless dogs do ye not see how young and frail he is let him go i will take his lashes marry a good thought and thanks for it said sir hugh his face lighting with a sardonic satisfaction let the little beggar go and give this fellow a dozen in his place an honest dozen well laid on the king was in the act of entering a fierce protest but sir hugh silenced him with the potent remark yes speak up do and free thy mind only mark ye that for each word you utter he shall get six strokes the more hendon was removed from the stocks and his back laid bare and whilst the lash was applied the poor little king turned away his face and allowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked ah brave good heart he said to himself this loyal deed shall never perish out of my memory i will not forget it and neither shall they he added with passion whilst he mused his appreciation of hendons magnanimous conduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind and so also did his gratefulness for it presently he said to himself who saves his prince from wounds and possible death and this he did for me performs high service but it is little it is nothing oh less than nothing when tis weighed against the act of him who saves his prince from shame hendon made no outcry under the scourge but bore the heavy blows with soldierly fortitude this together with his redeeming the boy by taking his stripes for him compelled the respect of even that forlorn and degraded mob that was gathered there and its gibes and hootings died away and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows the stillness that pervaded the place when hendon found himself once more in the stocks was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour which had prevailed there so little a while before the king came softly to hendons side and whispered in his ear kings cannot ennoble thee thou good great soul for one who is higher than kings hath done that for thee but a king can confirm thy nobility to men he picked up the scourge from the ground touched hendons bleeding shoulders lightly with it and whispered edward of england dubs thee earl hendon was touched the water welled to his eyes yet at the same time the grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his gravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward mirth from showing outside to be suddenly hoisted naked and gory from the common stocks to the alpine altitude and splendour of an earldom seemed to him the last possibility in the line of the grotesque he said to himself now am i finely tinselled indeed the spectre knight of the kingdom of dreams and shadows is become a spectre earl a dizzy flight for a callow wing an this go on i shall presently be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and make believe honours but i shall value them all valueless as they are for the love that doth bestow them better these poor mock dignities of mine that come unasked from a clean hand and a right spirit than real ones bought by servility from grudging and interested power the dreaded sir hugh wheeled his horse about and as he spurred away the living wall divided silently to let him pass and as silently closed together again and so remained nobody went so far as to venture a remark in favour of the prisoner or in compliment to him but no matter the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself a late comer who was not posted as to the present circumstances and who delivered a sneer at the impostor and was in the act of following it with a dead cat was promptly knocked down and kicked out without any words and then the deep quiet resumed sway once more chapter xxix to london when hendons term of service in the stocks was finished he was released and ordered to quit the region and come back no more his sword was restored to him and also his mule and his donkey he mounted and rode off followed by the king the crowd opening with quiet respectfulness to let them pass and then dispersing when they were gone hendon was soon absorbed in thought there were questions of high import to be answered what should he do whither should he go powerful help must be found somewhere or he must relinquish his inheritance and remain under the imputation of being an impostor besides where could he hope to find this powerful help where indeed it was a knotty question by and by a thought occurred to him which pointed to a possibility the slenderest of slender possibilities certainly but still worth considering for lack of any other that promised anything at all he remembered what old andrews had said about the young kings goodness and his generous championship of the wronged and unfortunate why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for justice ah yes but could so fantastic a pauper get admission to the august presence of a monarch never mind let that matter take care of itself it was a bridge that would not need to be crossed till he should come to it he was an old campaigner and used to inventing shifts and expedients no doubt he would be able to find a way yes he would strike for the capital maybe his fathers old friend sir humphrey marlow would help him good old sir humphrey head lieutenant of the late kings kitchen or stables or something miles could not remember just what or which now that he had something to turn his energies to a distinctly defined object to accomplish the fog of humiliation and depression which had settled down upon his spirits lifted and blew away and he raised his head and looked about him he was surprised to see how far he had come the village was away behind him the king was jogging along in his wake with his head bowed for he too was deep in plans and thinkings a sorrowful misgiving clouded hendons new born cheerfulness would the boy be willing to go again to a city where during all his brief life he had never known anything but ill usage and pinching want but the question must be asked it could not be avoided so hendon reined up and called out i had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound thy commands my liege to london hendon moved on again mightily contented with the answer but astounded at it too the whole journey was made without an adventure of importance but it ended with one about ten o clock on the night of the th of february they stepped upon london bridge in the midst of a writhing struggling jam of howling and hurrahing people whose beer jolly faces stood out strongly in the glare from manifold torches and at that instant the decaying head of some former duke or other grandee tumbled down between them striking hendon on the elbow and then bounding off among the hurrying confusion of feet so evanescent and unstable are mens works in this world the late good king is but three weeks dead and three days in his grave and already the adornments which he took such pains to select from prominent people for his noble bridge are falling a citizen stumbled over that head and drove his own head into the back of somebody in front of him who turned and knocked down the first person that came handy and was promptly laid out himself by that persons friend it was the right ripe time for a free fight for the festivities of the morrow coronation day were already beginning everybody was full of strong drink and patriotism within five minutes the free fight was occupying a good deal of ground within ten or twelve it covered an acre of so and was become a riot by this time hendon and the king were hopelessly separated from each other and lost in the rush and turmoil of the roaring masses of humanity and so we leave them chapter xxx toms progress whilst the true king wandered about the land poorly clad poorly fed cuffed and derided by tramps one while herding with thieves and murderers in a jail another and called idiot and impostor by all impartially the mock king tom canty enjoyed quite a different experience when we saw him last royalty was just beginning to have a bright side for him this bright side went on brightening more and more every day in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and delightfulness he lost his fears his misgivings faded out and died his embarrassments departed and gave place to an easy and confident bearing he worked the whipping boy mine to ever increasing profit he ordered my lady elizabeth and my lady jane grey into his presence when he wanted to play or talk and dismissed them when he was done with them with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances it no longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand at parting he came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night and dressed with intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning it came to be a proud pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession of officers of state and gentlemen at arms insomuch indeed that he doubled his guard of gentlemen at arms and made them a hundred he liked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors and the distant voices responding way for the king he even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council and seeming to be something more than the lord protectors mouthpiece he liked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains and listen to the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who called him brothero happy tom canty late of offal court he enjoyed his splendid clothes and ordered more he found his four hundred servants too few for his proper grandeur and trebled them the adulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet music to his ears he remained kind and gentle and a sturdy and determined champion of all that were oppressed and he made tireless war upon unjust laws yet upon occasion being offended he could turn upon an earl or even a duke and give him a look that would make him tremble once when his royal sister the grimly holy lady mary set herself to reason with him against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people who would otherwise be jailed or hanged or burned and reminded him that their august late fathers prisons had sometimes contained as high as sixty thousand convicts at one time and that during his admirable reign he had delivered seventy two thousand thieves and robbers over to death by the executioner the boy was filled with generous indignation and commanded her to go to her closet and beseech god to take away the stone that was in her breast and give her a human heart did tom canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful prince who had treated him so kindly and flown out with such hot zeal to avenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace gate yes his first royal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful thoughts about the lost prince and with sincere longings for his return and happy restoration to his native rights and splendours but as time wore on and the prince did not come toms mind became more and more occupied with his new and enchanting experiences and by little and little the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts and finally when he did intrude upon them at intervals he was become an unwelcome spectre for he made tom feel guilty and ashamed toms poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his mind at first he pined for them sorrowed for them longed to see them but later the thought of their coming some day in their rags and dirt and betraying him with their kisses and pulling him down from his lofty place and dragging him back to penury and degradation and the slums made him shudder at last they ceased to trouble his thoughts almost wholly and he was content even glad for whenever their mournful and accusing faces did rise before him now they made him feel more despicable than the worms that crawl at midnight of the th of february tom canty was sinking to sleep in his rich bed in the palace guarded by his loyal vassals and surrounded by the pomps of royalty a happy boy for tomorrow was the day appointed for his solemn crowning as king of england at that same hour edward the true king hungry and thirsty soiled and draggled worn with travel and clothed in rags and shreds his share of the results of the riot was wedged in among a crowd of people who were watching with deep interest certain hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of westminster abbey busy as ants they were making the last preparation for the royal coronation chapter xxxi the recognition procession when tom canty awoke the next morning the air was heavy with a thunderous murmur all the distances were charged with it it was music to him for it meant that the english world was out in its strength to give loyal welcome to the great day presently tom found himself once more the chief figure in a wonderful floating pageant on the thames for by ancient custom the recognition procession through london must start from the tower and he was bound thither when he arrived there the sides of the venerable fortress seemed suddenly rent in a thousand places and from every rent leaped a red tongue of flame and a white gush of smoke a deafening explosion followed which drowned the shoutings of the multitude and made the ground tremble the flame jets the smoke and the explosions were repeated over and over again with marvellous celerity so that in a few moments the old tower disappeared in the vast fog of its own smoke all but the very top of the tall pile called the white tower this with its banners stood out above the dense bank of vapour as a mountain peak projects above a cloud rack tom canty splendidly arrayed mounted a prancing war steed whose rich trappings almost reached to the ground his uncle the lord protector somerset similarly mounted took place in his rear the kings guard formed in single ranks on either side clad in burnished armour after the protector followed a seemingly interminable procession of resplendent nobles attended by their vassals after these came the lord mayor and the aldermanic body in crimson velvet robes and with their gold chains across their breasts and after these the officers and members of all the guilds of london in rich raiment and bearing the showy banners of the several corporations also in the procession as a special guard of honour through the city was the ancient and honourable artillery company an organisation already three hundred years old at that time and the only military body in england possessing the privilege which it still possesses in our day of holding itself independent of the commands of parliament it was a brilliant spectacle and was hailed with acclamations all along the line as it took its stately way through the packed multitudes of citizens the chronicler says the king as he entered the city was received by the people with prayers welcomings cries and tender words and all signs which argue an earnest love of subjects toward their sovereign and the king by holding up his glad countenance to such as stood afar off and most tender language to those that stood nigh his grace showed himself no less thankful to receive the peoples goodwill than they to offer it to all that wished him well he gave thanks to such as bade god save his grace he said in return god save you all and added that he thanked them with all his heart wonderfully transported were the people with the loving answers and gestures of their king in fenchurch street a fair child in costly apparel stood on a stage to welcome his majesty to the city the last verse of his greeting was in these words welcomeo king as much as hearts can think welcome again as much as tongue can tell welcome to joyous tongues and hearts that will not shrink god thee preserve we pray and wish thee ever well the people burst forth in a glad shout repeating with one voice what the child had said tom canty gazed abroad over the surging sea of eager faces and his heart swelled with exultation and he felt that the one thing worth living for in this world was to be a king and a nations idol presently he caught sight at a distance of a couple of his ragged offal court comrades one of them the lord high admiral in his late mimic court the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the same pretentious fiction and his pride swelled higher than ever oh if they could only recognise him now what unspeakable glory it would be if they could recognise him and realise that the derided mock king of the slums and back alleys was become a real king with illustrious dukes and princes for his humble menials and the english world at his feet but he had to deny himself and choke down his desire for such a recognition might cost more than it would come to so he turned away his head and left the two soiled lads to go on with their shoutings and glad adulations unsuspicious of whom it was they were lavishing them upon every now and then rose the cry a largess a largess and tom responded by scattering a handful of bright new coins abroad for the multitude to scramble for the chronicler says at the upper end of gracechurch street before the sign of the eagle the city had erected a gorgeous arch beneath which was a stage which stretched from one side of the street to the other this was an historical pageant representing the kings immediate progenitors there sat elizabeth of york in the midst of an immense white rose whose petals formed elaborate furbelows around her by her side was henry vii issuing out of a vast red rose disposed in the same manner the hands of the royal pair were locked together and the wedding ring ostentatiously displayed from the red and white roses proceeded a stem which reached up to a second stage occupied by henry viii issuing from a red and white rose with the effigy of the new kings mother jane seymour represented by his side one branch sprang from this pair which mounted to a third stage where sat the effigy of edward vi himself enthroned in royal majesty and the whole pageant was framed with wreaths of roses red and white this quaint and gaudy spectacle so wrought upon the rejoicing people that their acclamations utterly smothered the small voice of the child whose business it was to explain the thing in eulogistic rhymes but tom canty was not sorry for this loyal uproar was sweeter music to him than any poetry no matter what its quality might be whithersoever tom turned his happy young face the people recognised the exactness of his effigys likeness to himself the flesh and blood counterpart and new whirlwinds of applause burst forth the great pageant moved on and still on under one triumphal arch after another and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical tableaux each of which typified and exalted some virtue or talent or merit of the little kings throughout the whole of cheapside from every penthouse and window hung banners and streamers and the richest carpets stuffs and cloth of gold tapestried the streets specimens of the great wealth of the stores within and the splendour of this thoroughfare was equalled in the other streets and in some even surpassed and all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me me murmured tom canty the mock kings cheeks were flushed with excitement his eyes were flashing his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure at this point just as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess he caught sight of a pale astounded face which was strained forward out of the second rank of the crowd its intense eyes riveted upon him a sickening consternation struck through him he recognised his mother and up flew his hand palm outward before his eyes that old involuntary gesture born of a forgotten episode and perpetuated by habit in an instant more she had torn her way out of the press and past the guards and was at his side she embraced his leg she covered it with kisses she criedo my child my darling lifting toward him a face that was transfigured with joy and love the same instant an officer of the kings guard snatched her away with a curse and sent her reeling back whence she came with a vigorous impulse from his strong arm the words i do not know you woman were falling from tom cantys lips when this piteous thing occurred but it smote him to the heart to see her treated so and as she turned for a last glimpse of him whilst the crowd was swallowing her from his sight she seemed so wounded so broken hearted that a shame fell upon him which consumed his pride to ashes and withered his stolen royalty his grandeurs were stricken valueless they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags the procession moved on and still on through ever augmenting splendours and ever augmenting tempests of welcome but to tom canty they were as if they had not been he neither saw nor heard royalty had lost its grace and sweetness its pomps were become a reproach remorse was eating his heart out he said would god i were free of my captivity he had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the first days of his compulsory greatness the shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and interminable serpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city and through the huzzaing hosts but still the king rode with bowed head and vacant eyes seeing only his mothers face and that wounded look in it largess largess the cry fell upon an unheeding ear long live edward of england it seemed as if the earth shook with the explosion but there was no response from the king he heard it only as one hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown to the ear out of a great distance for it was smothered under another sound which was still nearer in his own breast in his accusing conscience a voice which kept repeating those shameful words i do not know you woman the words smote upon the kings soul as the strokes of a funeral bell smite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him of secret treacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone new glories were unfolded at every turning new wonders new marvels sprang into view the pent clamours of waiting batteries were released new raptures poured from the throats of the waiting multitudes but the king gave no sign and the accusing voice that went moaning through his comfortless breast was all the sound he heard by and by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a little and became touched with a something like solicitude or anxiety an abatement in the volume of the applause was observable too the lord protector was quick to notice these things he was as quick to detect the cause he spurred to the kings side bent low in his saddle uncovered and said my liege it is an ill time for dreaming the people observe thy downcast head thy clouded mien and they take it for an omen be advised unveil the sun of royalty and let it shine upon these boding vapours and disperse them lift up thy face and smile upon the people so saying the duke scattered a handful of coins to right and left then retired to his place the mock king did mechanically as he had been bidden his smile had no heart in it but few eyes were near enough or sharp enough to detect that the noddings of his plumed head as he saluted his subjects were full of grace and graciousness the largess which he delivered from his hand was royally liberal so the peoples anxiety vanished and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a volume as before still once more a little before the progress was ended the duke was obliged to ride forward and make remonstrance he whispered o dread sovereign shake off these fatal humours the eyes of the world are upon thee then he added with sharp annoyance perdition catch that crazy pauper twas she that hath disturbed your highness the gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the duke and said in a dead voice she was my mother my god groaned the protector as he reined his horse backward to his post the omen was pregnant with prophecy he is gone mad again chapter xxxii coronation day let us go backward a few hours and place ourselves in westminster abbey at four o clock in the morning of this memorable coronation day we are not without company for although it is still night we find the torch lighted galleries already filling up with people who are well content to sit still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall come for them to see what they may not hope to see twice in their lives the coronation of a king yes london and westminster have been astir ever since the warning guns boomed at three o clock and already crowds of untitled rich folk who have bought the privilege of trying to find sitting room in the galleries are flocking in at the entrances reserved for their sort the hours drag along tediously enough all stir has ceased for some time for every gallery has long ago been packed we may sit now and look and think at our leisure we have glimpses here and there and yonder through the dim cathedral twilight of portions of many galleries and balconies wedged full with other people the other portions of these galleries and balconies being cut off from sight by intervening pillars and architectural projections we have in view the whole of the great north transept empty and waiting for englands privileged ones we see also the ample area or platform carpeted with rich stuffs whereon the throne stands the throne occupies the centre of the platform and is raised above it upon an elevation of four steps within the seat of the throne is enclosed a rough flat rock the stone of scone which many generations of scottish kings sat on to be crowned and so it in time became holy enough to answer a like purpose for english monarchs both the throne and its footstool are covered with cloth of gold stillness reigns the torches blink dully the time drags heavily but at last the lagging daylight asserts itself the torches are extinguished and a mellow radiance suffuses the great spaces all features of the noble building are distinct now but soft and dreamy for the sun is lightly veiled with clouds at seven o clock the first break in the drowsy monotony occurs for on the stroke of this hour the first peeress enters the transept clothed like solomon for splendour and is conducted to her appointed place by an official clad in satins and velvets whilst a duplicate of him gathers up the ladys long train follows after and when the lady is seated arranges the train across her lap for her he then places her footstool according to her desire after which he puts her coronet where it will be convenient to her hand when the time for the simultaneous coroneting of the nobles shall arrive by this time the peeresses are flowing in in a glittering stream and the satin clad officials are flitting and glinting everywhere seating them and making them comfortable the scene is animated enough now there is stir and life and shifting colour everywhere after a time quiet reigns again for the peeresses are all come and are all in their places a solid acre or such a matter of human flowers resplendent in variegated colours and frosted like a milky way with diamonds there are all ages here brown wrinkled white haired dowagers who are able to go back and still back down the stream of time and recall the crowning of richard iii and the troublous days of that old forgotten age and there are handsome middle aged dames and lovely and gracious young matrons and gentle and beautiful young girls with beaming eyes and fresh complexions who may possibly put on their jewelled coronets awkwardly when the great time comes for the matter will be new to them and their excitement will be a sore hindrance still this may not happen for the hair of all these ladies has been arranged with a special view to the swift and successful lodging of the crown in its place when the signal comes we have seen that this massed array of peeresses is sown thick with diamonds and we also see that it is a marvellous spectacle but now we are about to be astonished in earnest about nine the clouds suddenly break away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere and drifts slowly along the ranks of ladies and every rank it touches flames into a dazzling splendour of many coloured fires and we tingle to our finger tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by the surprise and the beauty of the spectacle presently a special envoy from some distant corner of the orient marching with the general body of foreign ambassadors crosses this bar of sunshine and we catch our breath the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates about him is so overpowering for he is crusted from head to heel with gems and his slightest movement showers a dancing radiance all around him let us change the tense for convenience the time drifted along one hour two hours two hours and a half then the deep booming of artillery told that the king and his grand procession had arrived at last so the waiting multitude rejoiced all knew that a further delay must follow for the king must be prepared and robed for the solemn ceremony but this delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling of the peers of the realm in their stately robes these were conducted ceremoniously to their seats and their coronets placed conveniently at hand and meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with interest for most of them were beholding for the first time dukes earls and barons whose names had been historical for five hundred years when all were finally seated the spectacle from the galleries and all coigns of vantage was complete a gorgeous one to look upon and to remember now the robed and mitred great heads of the church and their attendants filed in upon the platform and took their appointed places these were followed by the lord protector and other great officials and these again by a steel clad detachment of the guard there was a waiting pause then at a signal a triumphant peal of music burst forth and tom canty clothed in a long robe of cloth of gold appeared at a door and stepped upon the platform the entire multitude rose and the ceremony of the recognition ensued then a noble anthem swept the abbey with its rich waves of sound and thus heralded and welcomed tom canty was conducted to the throne the ancient ceremonies went on with impressive solemnity whilst the audience gazed and as they drew nearer and nearer to completion tom canty grew pale and still paler and a deep and steadily deepening woe and despondency settled down upon his spirits and upon his remorseful heart at last the final act was at hand the archbishop of canterbury lifted up the crown of england from its cushion and held it out over the trembling mock kings head in the same instant a rainbow radiance flashed along the spacious transept for with one impulse every individual in the great concourse of nobles lifted a coronet and poised it over his or her head and paused in that attitude a deep hush pervaded the abbey at this impressive moment a startling apparition intruded upon the scene an apparition observed by none in the absorbed multitude until it suddenly appeared moving up the great central aisle it was a boy bareheaded ill shod and clothed in coarse plebeian garments that were falling to rags he raised his hand with a solemnity which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect and delivered this note of warning i forbid you to set the crown of england upon that forfeited head i am the king in an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy but in the same instant tom canty in his regal vestments made a swift step forward and cried out in a ringing voice loose him and forbear he is the king a sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage and they partly rose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one another and at the chief figures in this scene like persons who wondered whether they were awake and in their senses or asleep and dreaming the lord protector was as amazed as the rest but quickly recovered himself and exclaimed in a voice of authority mind not his majesty his malady is upon him again seize the vagabond he would have been obeyed but the mock king stamped his foot and cried out on your peril touch him not he is the king the hands were withheld a paralysis fell upon the house no one moved no one spoke indeed no one knew how to act or what to say in so strange and surprising an emergency while all minds were struggling to right themselves the boy still moved steadily forward with high port and confident mien he had never halted from the beginning and while the tangled minds still floundered helplessly he stepped upon the platform and the mock king ran with a glad face to meet him and fell on his knees before him and said oh my lord the king let poor tom canty be first to swear fealty to thee and say put on thy crown and enter into thine own again the lord protectors eye fell sternly upon the new comers face but straightway the sternness vanished away and gave place to an expression of wondering surprise this thing happened also to the other great officers they glanced at each other and retreated a step by a common and unconscious impulse the thought in each mind was the same what a strange resemblance the lord protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity then he said with grave respectfulness by your favour sir i desire to ask certain questions which i will answer them my lord the duke asked him many questions about the court the late king the prince the princesses the boy answered them correctly and without hesitating he described the rooms of state in the palace the late kings apartments and those of the prince of wales it was strange it was wonderful yes it was unaccountable so all said that heard it the tide was beginning to turn and tom cantys hopes to run high when the lord protector shook his head and said it is true it is most wonderful but it is no more than our lord the king likewise can do this remark and this reference to himself as still the king saddened tom canty and he felt his hopes crumbling from under him these are not proofs added the protector the tide was turning very fast now very fast indeed but in the wrong direction it was leaving poor tom canty stranded on the throne and sweeping the other out to sea the lord protector communed with himself shook his head the thought forced itself upon him it is perilous to the state and to us all to entertain so fateful a riddle as this it could divide the nation and undermine the throne he turned and said sir thomas arrest this no hold his face lighted and he confronted the ragged candidate with this question where lieth the great seal answer me this truly and the riddle is unriddled for only he that was prince of wales can so answer on so trivial a thing hang a throne and a dynasty it was a lucky thought a happy thought that it was so considered by the great officials was manifested by the silent applause that shot from eye to eye around their circle in the form of bright approving glances yes none but the true prince could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the vanished great seal this forlorn little impostor had been taught his lesson well but here his teachings must fail for his teacher himself could not answer that question ah very good very good indeed now we shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in short order and so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with satisfaction and looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy of guilty confusion how surprised they were then to see nothing of the sort happen how they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly in a confident and untroubled voice and say there is nought in this riddle that is difficult then without so much as a by your leave to anybody he turned and gave this command with the easy manner of one accustomed to doing such things my lord st john go you to my private cabinet in the palace for none knoweth the place better than you and close down to the floor in the left corner remotest from the door that opens from the ante chamber you shall find in the wall a brazen nail head press upon it and a little jewel closet will fly open which not even you do know of no nor any soul else in all the world but me and the trusty artisan that did contrive it for me the first thing that falleth under your eye will be the great seal fetch it hither all the company wondered at this speech and wondered still more to see the little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy or apparent fear of mistake and call him by name with such a placidly convincing air of having known him all his life the peer was almost surprised into obeying he even made a movement as if to go but quickly recovered his tranquil attitude and confessed his blunder with a blush tom canty turned upon him and said sharply why dost thou hesitate hast not heard the kings command go the lord st john made a deep obeisance and it was observed that it was a significantly cautious and non committal one it not being delivered at either of the kings but at the neutral ground about half way between the two and took his leave now began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official group which was slow scarcely perceptible and yet steady and persistent a movement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is turned slowly whereby the components of one splendid cluster fall away and join themselves to another a movement which little by little in the present case dissolved the glittering crowd that stood about tom canty and clustered it together again in the neighbourhood of the new comer tom canty stood almost alone now ensued a brief season of deep suspense and waiting during which even the few faint hearts still remaining near tom canty gradually scraped together courage enough to glide one by one over to the majority so at last tom canty in his royal robes and jewels stood wholly alone and isolated from the world a conspicuous figure occupying an eloquent vacancy now the lord st john was seen returning as he advanced up the mid aisle the interest was so intense that the low murmur of conversation in the great assemblage died out and was succeeded by a profound hush a breathless stillness through which his footfalls pulsed with a dull and distant sound every eye was fastened upon him as he moved along he reached the platform paused a moment then moved toward tom canty with a deep obeisance and said sire the seal is not there a mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague patient with more haste than the band of pallid and terrified courtiers melted away from the presence of the shabby little claimant of the crown in a moment he stood all alone without friend or supporter a target upon which was concentrated a bitter fire of scornful and angry looks the lord protector called out fiercely cast the beggar into the street and scourge him through the town the paltry knave is worth no more consideration officers of the guard sprang forward to obey but tom canty waved them off and said back whoso touches him perils his life the lord protector was perplexed in the last degree he said to the lord st john searched you well but it boots not to ask that it doth seem passing strange little things trifles slip out of ones ken and one does not think it matter for surprise but how so bulky a thing as the seal of england can vanish away and no man be able to get track of it again a massy golden disk tom canty with beaming eyes sprang forward and shouted hold that is enough was it round and thick and had it letters and devices graved upon it yes oh now i know what this great seal is that theres been such worry and pother about an ye had described it to me ye could have had it three weeks ago right well i know where it lies but it was not i that put it there first who then my liege asked the lord protector he that stands there the rightful king of england and he shall tell you himself where it lies then you will believe he knew it of his own knowledge bethink thee my king spur thy memory it was the last the very last thing thou didst that day before thou didst rush forth from the palace clothed in my rags to punish the soldier that insulted me a silence ensued undisturbed by a movement or a whisper and all eyes were fixed upon the new comer who stood with bent head and corrugated brow groping in his memory among a thronging multitude of valueless recollections for one single little elusive fact which found would seat him upon a throne unfound would leave him as he was for good and all a pauper and an outcast moment after moment passed the moments built themselves into minutes still the boy struggled silently on and gave no sign but at last he heaved a sigh shook his head slowly and said with a trembling lip and in a despondent voice i call the scene back all of it but the seal hath no place in it he paused then looked up and said with gentle dignity my lords and gentlemen if ye will rob your rightful sovereign of his own for lack of this evidence which he is not able to furnish i may not stay ye being powerless but oh folly oh madness my king cried tom canty in a panic wait think do not give up the cause is not lost nor shall be neither list to what i say follow every word i am going to bring that morning back again every hap just as it happened we talked i told you of my sisters nan and bet ah yes you remember that and about mine old grandam and the rough games of the lads of offal court yes you remember these things also very well follow me still you shall recall everything you gave me food and drink and did with princely courtesy send away the servants so that my low breeding might not shame me before them ah yes this also you remember as tom checked off his details and the other boy nodded his head in recognition of them the great audience and the officials stared in puzzled wonderment the tale sounded like true history yet how could this impossible conjunction between a prince and a beggar boy have come about never was a company of people so perplexed so interested and so stupefied before for a jest my prince we did exchange garments then we stood before a mirror and so alike were we that both said it seemed as if there had been no change made yes you remember that then you noticed that the soldier had hurt my hand look here it is i cannot yet even write with it the fingers are so stiff at this your highness sprang up vowing vengeance upon that soldier and ran towards the door you passed a table that thing you call the seal lay on that table you snatched it up and looked eagerly about as if for a place to hide it your eye caught sight of there tis sufficient and the good god be thanked exclaimed the ragged claimant in a mighty excitement go my good st john in an arm piece of the milanese armour that hangs on the wall thou lt find the seal right my king right cried tom canty now the sceptre of england is thine own and it were better for him that would dispute it that he had been born dumb go my lord st john give thy feet wings the whole assemblage was on its feet now and well nigh out of its mind with uneasiness apprehension and consuming excitement on the floor and on the platform a deafening buzz of frantic conversation burst forth and for some time nobody knew anything or heard anything or was interested in anything but what his neighbour was shouting into his ear or he was shouting into his neighbours ear time nobody knew how much of it swept by unheeded and unnoted at last a sudden hush fell upon the house and in the same moment st john appeared upon the platform and held the great seal aloft in his hand then such a shout went up long live the true king for five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of musical instruments and was white with a storm of waving handkerchiefs and through it all a ragged lad the most conspicuous figure in england stood flushed and happy and proud in the centre of the spacious platform with the great vassals of the kingdom kneeling around him then all rose and tom canty cried out nowo my king take these regal garments back and give poor tom thy servant his shreds and remnants again the lord protector spoke up let the small varlet be stripped and flung into the tower but the new king the true king said i will not have it so but for him i had not got my crown again none shall lay a hand upon him to harm him and as for thee my good uncle my lord protector this conduct of thine is not grateful toward this poor lad for i hear he hath made thee a duke the protector blushed yet he was not a king wherefore what is thy fine title worth now to morrow you shall sue to me through him for its confirmation else no duke but a simple earl shalt thou remain under this rebuke his grace the duke of somerset retired a little from the front for the moment the king turned to tom and said kindly my poor boy how was it that you could remember where i hid the seal when i could not remember it myself ah my king that was easy since i used it divers days used it yet could not explain where it was i did not know it was that they wanted they did not describe it your majesty then how used you it the red blood began to steal up into toms cheeks and he dropped his eyes and was silent speak up good lad and fear nothing said the king how used you the great seal of england tom stammered a moment in a pathetic confusion then got it out to crack nuts with poor child the avalanche of laughter that greeted this nearly swept him off his feet but if a doubt remained in any mind that tom canty was not the king of england and familiar with the august appurtenances of royalty this reply disposed of it utterly meantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed from toms shoulders to the kings whose rags were effectually hidden from sight under it then the coronation ceremonies were resumed the true king was anointed and the crown set upon his head whilst cannon thundered the news to the city and all london seemed to rock with applause chapter xxxiii edward as king miles hendon was picturesque enough before he got into the riot on london bridge he was more so when he got out of it he had but little money when he got in none at all when he got out the pickpockets had stripped him of his last farthing but no matter so he found his boy being a soldier he did not go at his task in a random way but set to work first of all to arrange his campaign what would the boy naturally do where would he naturally go well argued miles he would naturally go to his former haunts for that is the instinct of unsound minds when homeless and forsaken as well as of sound ones whereabouts were his former haunts his rags taken together with the low villain who seemed to know him and who even claimed to be his father indicated that his home was in one or another of the poorest and meanest districts of london would the search for him be difficult or long no it was likely to be easy and brief he would not hunt for the boy he would hunt for a crowd in the centre of a big crowd or a little one sooner or later he should find his poor little friend sure and the mangy mob would be entertaining itself with pestering and aggravating the boy who would be proclaiming himself king as usual then miles hendon would cripple some of those people and carry off his little ward and comfort and cheer him with loving words and the two would never be separated any more so miles started on his quest hour after hour he tramped through back alleys and squalid streets seeking groups and crowds and finding no end of them but never any sign of the boy this greatly surprised him but did not discourage him to his notion there was nothing the matter with his plan of campaign the only miscalculation about it was that the campaign was becoming a lengthy one whereas he had expected it to be short when daylight arrived at last he had made many a mile and canvassed many a crowd but the only result was that he was tolerably tired rather hungry and very sleepy he wanted some breakfast but there was no way to get it to beg for it did not occur to him as to pawning his sword he would as soon have thought of parting with his honour he could spare some of his clothes yes but one could as easily find a customer for a disease as for such clothes at noon he was still tramping among the rabble which followed after the royal procession now for he argued that this regal display would attract his little lunatic powerfully he followed the pageant through all its devious windings about london and all the way to westminster and the abbey he drifted here and there amongst the multitudes that were massed in the vicinity for a weary long time baffled and perplexed and finally wandered off thinking and trying to contrive some way to better his plan of campaign by and by when he came to himself out of his musings he discovered that the town was far behind him and that the day was growing old he was near the river and in the country it was a region of fine rural seats not the sort of district to welcome clothes like his it was not at all cold so he stretched himself on the ground in the lee of a hedge to rest and think drowsiness presently began to settle upon his senses the faint and far off boom of cannon was wafted to his ear and he said to himself the new king is crowned and straightway fell asleep he had not slept or rested before for more than thirty hours he did not wake again until near the middle of the next morning he got up lame stiff and half famished washed himself in the river stayed his stomach with a pint or two of water and trudged off toward westminster grumbling at himself for having wasted so much time hunger helped him to a new plan now he would try to get speech with old sir humphrey marlow and borrow a few marks and but that was enough of a plan for the present it would be time enough to enlarge it when this first stage should be accomplished toward eleven o clock he approached the palace and although a host of showy people were about him moving in the same direction he was not inconspicuous his costume took care of that he watched these peoples faces narrowly hoping to find a charitable one whose possessor might be willing to carry his name to the old lieutenant as to trying to get into the palace himself that was simply out of the question presently our whipping boy passed him then wheeled about and scanned his figure well saying to himself an that is not the very vagabond his majesty is in such a worry about then am i an ass though belike i was that before he answereth the description to a rag that god should make two such would be to cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition i would i could contrive an excuse to speak with him miles hendon saved him the trouble for he turned about then as a man generally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard at him from behind and observing a strong interest in the boys eyes he stepped toward him and said you have just come out from the palace do you belong there yes your worship know you sir humphrey marlow the boy started and said to himself lord mine old departed father then he answered aloud right well your worship good is he within yes said the boy and added to himself within his grave might i crave your favour to carry my name to him and say i beg to say a word in his ear i will despatch the business right willingly fair sir then say miles hendon son of sir richard is here without i shall be greatly bounden to you my good lad the boy looked disappointed the king did not name him so he said to himself but it mattereth not this is his twin brother and can give his majesty news of t other sir odds and ends i warrant so he said to miles step in there a moment good sir and wait till i bring you word hendon retired to the place indicated it was a recess sunk in the palace wall with a stone bench in it a shelter for sentinels in bad weather he had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers in charge of an officer passed by the officer saw him halted his men and commanded hendon to come forth he obeyed and was promptly arrested as a suspicious character prowling within the precincts of the palace things began to look ugly poor miles was going to explain but the officer roughly silenced him and ordered his men to disarm him and search him god of his mercy grant that they find somewhat said poor miles i have searched enow and failed yet is my need greater than theirs nothing was found but a document the officer tore it open and hendon smiled when he recognised the pot hooks made by his lost little friend that black day at hendon hall the officers face grew dark as he read the english paragraph and miles blenched to the opposite colour as he listened another new claimant of the crown cried the officer verily they breed like rabbits to day seize the rascal men and see ye keep him fast whilst i convey this precious paper within and send it to the king he hurried away leaving the prisoner in the grip of the halberdiers now is my evil luck ended at last muttered hendon for i shall dangle at a ropes end for a certainty by reason of that bit of writing and what will become of my poor lad ah only the good god knoweth by and by he saw the officer coming again in a great hurry so he plucked his courage together purposing to meet his trouble as became a man the officer ordered the men to loose the prisoner and return his sword to him then bowed respectfully and said please you sir to follow me hendon followed saying to himself an i were not travelling to death and judgment and so must needs economise in sin i would throttle this knave for his mock courtesy the two traversed a populous court and arrived at the grand entrance of the palace where the officer with another bow delivered hendon into the hands of a gorgeous official who received him with profound respect and led him forward through a great hall lined on both sides with rows of splendid flunkeys who made reverential obeisance as the two passed along but fell into death throes of silent laughter at our stately scarecrow the moment his back was turned and up a broad staircase among flocks of fine folk and finally conducted him into a vast room clove a passage for him through the assembled nobility of england then made a bow reminded him to take his hat off and left him standing in the middle of the room a mark for all eyes for plenty of indignant frowns and for a sufficiency of amused and derisive smiles miles hendon was entirely bewildered there sat the young king under a canopy of state five steps away with his head bent down and aside speaking with a sort of human bird of paradise a duke maybe hendon observed to himself that it was hard enough to be sentenced to death in the full vigour of life without having this peculiarly public humiliation added he wished the king would hurry about it some of the gaudy people near by were becoming pretty offensive at this moment the king raised his head slightly and hendon caught a good view of his face the sight nearly took his breath away he stood gazing at the fair young face like one transfixed then presently ejaculated lo the lord of the kingdom of dreams and shadows on his throne he muttered some broken sentences still gazing and marvelling then turned his eyes around and about scanning the gorgeous throng and the splendid saloon murmuring but these are real verily these are real surely it is not a dream he stared at the king again and thought is it a dream or is he the veritable sovereign of england and not the friendless poor tom o bedlam i took him for who shall solve me this riddle a sudden idea flashed in his eye and he strode to the wall gathered up a chair brought it back planted it on the floor and sat down in it a buzz of indignation broke out a rough hand was laid upon him and a voice exclaimed up thou mannerless clown would st sit in the presence of the king the disturbance attracted his majestys attention who stretched forth his hand and cried out touch him not it is his right the throng fell back stupefied the king went on learn ye all ladies lords and gentlemen that this is my trusty and well beloved servant miles hendon who interposed his good sword and saved his prince from bodily harm and possible death and for this he is a knight by the kings voice also learn that for a higher service in that he saved his sovereign stripes and shame taking these upon himself he is a peer of england earl of kent and shall have gold and lands meet for the dignity more the privilege which he hath just exercised is his by royal grant for we have ordained that the chiefs of his line shall have and hold the right to sit in the presence of the majesty of england henceforth age after age so long as the crown shall endure molest him not two persons who through delay had only arrived from the country during this morning and had now been in this room only five minutes stood listening to these words and looking at the king then at the scarecrow then at the king again in a sort of torpid bewilderment these were sir hugh and the lady edith but the new earl did not see them he was still staring at the monarch in a dazed way and muttering oh body o me this my pauper this my lunatic this is he whom i would show what grandeur was in my house of seventy rooms and seven and twenty servants this is he who had never known aught but rags for raiment kicks for comfort and offal for diet this is he whom i adopted and would make respectable would god i had a bag to hide my head in then his manners suddenly came back to him and he dropped upon his knees with his hands between the kings and swore allegiance and did homage for his lands and titles then he rose and stood respectfully aside a mark still for all eyes and much envy too now the king discovered sir hugh and spoke out with wrathful voice and kindling eye strip this robber of his false show and stolen estates and put him under lock and key till i have need of him the late sir hugh was led away there was a stir at the other end of the room now the assemblage fell apart and tom canty quaintly but richly clothed marched down between these living walls preceded by an usher he knelt before the king who said i have learned the story of these past few weeks and am well pleased with thee thou hast governed the realm with right royal gentleness and mercy thou hast found thy mother and thy sisters again good they shall be cared for and thy father shall hang if thou desire it and the law consent know all ye that hear my voice that from this day they that abide in the shelter of christs hospital and share the kings bounty shall have their minds and hearts fed as well as their baser parts and this boy shall dwell there and hold the chief place in its honourable body of governors during life and for that he hath been a king it is meet that other than common observance shall be his due wherefore note this his dress of state for by it he shall be known and none shall copy it and wheresoever he shall come it shall remind the people that he hath been royal in his time and none shall deny him his due of reverence or fail to give him salutation he hath the thrones protection he hath the crowns support he shall be known and called by the honourable title of the kings ward the proud and happy tom canty rose and kissed the kings hand and was conducted from the presence he did not waste any time but flew to his mother to tell her and nan and bet all about it and get them to help him enjoy the great news conclusion justice and retribution when the mysteries were all cleared up it came out by confession of hugh hendon that his wife had repudiated miles by his command that day at hendon hall a command assisted and supported by the perfectly trustworthy promise that if she did not deny that he was miles hendon and stand firmly to it he would have her life whereupon she said take it she did not value it and she would not repudiate miles then the husband said he would spare her life but have miles assassinated this was a different matter so she gave her word and kept it hugh was not prosecuted for his threats or for stealing his brothers estates and title because the wife and brother would not testify against him and the former would not have been allowed to do it even if she had wanted to hugh deserted his wife and went over to the continent where he presently died and by and by the earl of kent married his relict there were grand times and rejoicings at hendon village when the couple paid their first visit to the hall tom cantys father was never heard of again the king sought out the farmer who had been branded and sold as a slave and reclaimed him from his evil life with the rufflers gang and put him in the way of a comfortable livelihood he also took that old lawyer out of prison and remitted his fine he provided good homes for the daughters of the two baptist women whom he saw burned at the stake and roundly punished the official who laid the undeserved stripes upon miles hendons back he saved from the gallows the boy who had captured the stray falcon and also the woman who had stolen a remnant of cloth from a weaver but he was too late to save the man who had been convicted of killing a deer in the royal forest he showed favour to the justice who had pitied him when he was supposed to have stolen a pig and he had the gratification of seeing him grow in the public esteem and become a great and honoured man as long as the king lived he was fond of telling the story of his adventures all through from the hour that the sentinel cuffed him away from the palace gate till the final midnight when he deftly mixed himself into a gang of hurrying workmen and so slipped into the abbey and climbed up and hid himself in the confessors tomb and then slept so long next day that he came within one of missing the coronation altogether he said that the frequent rehearsing of the precious lesson kept him strong in his purpose to make its teachings yield benefits to his people and so whilst his life was spared he should continue to tell the story and thus keep its sorrowful spectacles fresh in his memory and the springs of pity replenished in his heart miles hendon and tom canty were favourites of the king all through his brief reign and his sincere mourners when he died the good earl of kent had too much sense to abuse his peculiar privilege but he exercised it twice after the instance we have seen of it before he was called from this world once at the accession of queen mary and once at the accession of queen elizabeth a descendant of his exercised it at the accession of james i before this ones son chose to use the privilege near a quarter of a century had elapsed and the privilege of the kents had faded out of most peoples memories so when the kent of that day appeared before charles i and his court and sat down in the sovereigns presence to assert and perpetuate the right of his house there was a fine stir indeed but the matter was soon explained and the right confirmed the last earl of the line fell in the wars of the commonwealth fighting for the king and the odd privilege ended with him tom canty lived to be a very old man a handsome white haired old fellow of grave and benignant aspect as long as he lasted he was honoured and he was also reverenced for his striking and peculiar costume kept the people reminded that in his time he had been royal so wherever he appeared the crowd fell apart making way for him and whispering one to another doff thy hat it is the kings ward and so they saluted and got his kindly smile in return and they valued it too for his was an honourable history yes king edward vi lived only a few years poor boy but he lived them worthily more than once when some great dignitary some gilded vassal of the crown made argument against his leniency and urged that some law which he was bent upon amending was gentle enough for its purpose and wrought no suffering or oppression which any one need mightily mind the young king turned the mournful eloquence of his great compassionate eyes upon him and answered what dost thou know of suffering and oppression i and my people know but not thou the reign of edward vi was a singularly merciful one for those harsh times now that we are taking leave of him let us try to keep this in our minds to his credit footnotes and twains notes for mark twains note see below under the relevant chapter heading he refers to the order of baronets or baronettes the barones minores as distinct

departure from judicial atrocity which the civilised world had seen this humane and kindly blue law code of two hundred and forty years ago stands all by itself with ages of bloody law on the further side of it and a century and three quarters of bloody english law on this side of it there has never been a time under the blue laws or any other when above fourteen crimes were punishable by death in connecticut but in england within the memory of men who are still hale in body and mind two hundred and twenty three crimes were punishable by death these facts are worth knowing and worth thinking about too
